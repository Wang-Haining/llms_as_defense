Um 
I don’t know 
I’m kind of on the borderline with this one 
Because 
Uh 
I was raised Catholic 
But 
I’m not really sure if I still go with that religion 

Um 
I guess a lot of their 
Their 
Uh 
Thoughts 
And 
Ideas are pretty much outdated to the times 
But 
Uh 
I don’t think they should have to change 
Because 
That’s what their 
They’ve based their entire faith on for the last two thousand years 

Um 
I don’t know 
Like 
Everything that they pretty much believe in has pretty much been centralized 
And 
Been determined for the last two thousand years 
And 
Just 
Because 
A lot of people nowadays don’t really follow the catholic church doesn’t mean they have to change their 
Uh 
Faith 

Um 
No 
Because 
That action is something that anybody could have done 
Just 
Because 
The priest did it doesn’t 
Like 
I mean yeah it makes it different 
But 
They didn’t make a big deal 
I mean they make a big deal about it when other people do it 
Just because a priest did it doesn’t really change the fact of what happened 
Anybody could have done it 

Um 
I actually don’t disagree with either one of those 
I don’t mind female priests or priests marrying 

Um 
I believe that females have the same 
Can achieve the same faith 
And 
That males can achieve 
So 
I have no reason to deny a woman from being a priest 
And 
I really don’t care if priests get married 
I don’t know 

Um 
Nope
