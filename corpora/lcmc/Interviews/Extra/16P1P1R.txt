PRIVACY RIGHTS
Ok 
Yup 
Well it seems like it 
It seems like it is 
It seems like the ends justify the means I guess 
If they wouldn’t have prevented it 
It would have been an even bigger deal 
But 
For them to be looking 
I don’t know if they like looked or some student found it 
I don’t know what happened 
Well um 
I don’t think it’s an invasion of privacy 
I 
It just seems like if you could use that method to stop something like that from happening 
It seems like 
It seems like a good thing 
Um 
Yeah 
Um 
Well 
Because if they didn’t stop it and 
It could have been bad I guess 
Um 
Myspace might not be like the most trustworthy thing but if you see something like that 
Um 
It should be stopped 
I mean it doesn’t seem like an invasion of privacy at all 
Well 
Because you’re putting it up on the internet so it should be like 
It should be public information 
Once you put it up on the internet you’re 
You can’t expect it to not be looked at 
I mean that’s just like common sense 
Um 
And just because they used that against him doesn’t mean 
Once it’s public information it’s just up for grabs 
Um 
Well 
Internet is like a whole different 
I feel like internet is open for anyone to look at 
But if they were to draw the line at I guess like tracking phone calls 
That seems like an invasion of privacy 
Um sure 
Um 
If they were to 
If a school were to get the cops involved 
Like to try to track down a kid just cause they thought that he might be up to something 
That seems like an invasion of privacy 
But if they have solid proof like something that the kid posted on the internet 
Um 
Especially if there’s like pictures to back it up or whatever 
Cause um 
You can’t believe everything I guess on the internet 
But if you want to further investigate something because of a lead on the internet 
It seems Ok 
But I think they should just draw the line at that 
Just internet is the only open information that they should be able to get 
Not like 
Like tapping their phones or 
Um 
Like private emails and stuff like that 
Um 
Woah 
I guess that’s just like referring to the Patriot Act I guess 
Which seems 
Uh 
I’m not too familiar with it 
But it seems like a little bit nineteen eightyfour-ish kinda 
But I mean it seems hard to justify that just because it seems like racial profiling when it’s over and done with 
But um 
If it actually proves itself to work 
Um 
I guess it’s not too bad 
Um 
Just like Myspace 
Like there shouldn’t be like hunting for that kind of stuff 
But like I mean if somebody finds out that a kid is about to blow up the school or whatever 
Like they should definitely act on that 
Uh no 
Not really 
Alright
