Um 
I agree with it because I feel that 
Um 
Marijuana has gotten a very bad rap 
Reputation for a drug that 
Has less 
Um 
Severe health effects then drugs that are legal like 
In my opinion alcohol’s got much more severe health effects then marijuana 
If uh 
Like drinking there’s so many problems that 
Brain damage and uh 
Liver and just there’s 
There’s a lot more severe health issues where as marijuana a lot of 
Like health issues like throat um 
And lung cancer doesn’t take effect unless it’s used in an extreme excess and I think that legalizing small amounts is fine because 
The small amounts 
It’s not 
Not as 
Not hazardous to your health really and 
I think that cigarettes could be worse cause it’s addicting and their legal 
So I think 
And ah 
They cause obviously cause cancer if used regularly and since they’re addictive it leads to that so I think that for a drug that has similar if not less severe health effects then alcohol and cigarettes which are legal I don’t understand why marijuana is illegal 

Um 
Well I think that 
Like if you were to like research the health effects of health like consequences of marijuana use a lot of it just uh 
Throat and lung irritation and also there’s no there’s been no like real studies that say that it causes 
That marijuana use causes cancer 
It’s kind of uh 
Still being looked into and there’s nothing really proving it whereas like there’s so much more 
You don’t get uh 
Brain damage from mari 
Like small amount of marijuana use whereas you can easily get brain damage from alcohol 
And alcohol is legal 
So 
That kinda doesn’t make sense 
In my opinion 

Yes 
Definitely 
Cause obviously the 
Like I said the effects of alcohol seem to be more severe and there seem to be more of them then marijuana use 

Um 
Well a lotta with the consequences of marijuana use 
Like the throat and lung irritation only occurs when it’s smoked heavily for a long period of time 
And um 
With alcohol 
I mean 4 years of college will damage your brain drinking all the time 
I mean its effects happen more quickly and they’re more consequences like um 
With the brain and liver and uh 
You know 
Your heart it effects a lot 
Alcohol 
A lot more then marijuana does 

Uh 
No
