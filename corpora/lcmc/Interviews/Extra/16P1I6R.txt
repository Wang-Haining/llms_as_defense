IRAQ WAR
Um 
The war 
I feel like the war is wrong 
Um 
It was completely 
It was started under false pretenses in my opinion 
Um 
We never really had any strong evidence to force us into war 
But 
I mean now that we’re stuck there 
I feel like we should pull out immediately 
I know that’s not the most common opinion 
But it just seems like the only way to prevent more 
Um 
Soldiers from dying that could be serving 
Um 
Bigger purposes 
Um 
Either staying here and 
Um 
Keeping the home country safe rather than being stuck in a foreign country where they’re not wanted at all by Iraqi citizens 
Um 
I’m not really sure what the real reason was for going to war there 
But I don’t know 
If it was about trying to establish a Democracy there 
That 
That probably became a goal after we went in there 
But um 
I don’t know 
I don’t think you could really force a government on a country 
It just doesn’t seem logical 
Um 
But they’re still trying and 
Um 
It seems like not too much progress is being made 
That I remember hearing that 
Um 
Like the Iraqi government that they put in charge went on like a six month vacation or something 
I don’t know 
Something ridiculous 
But um 
I don’t know 
It just seems like they’re not taking this as seriously as they should be 
Um 
But yeah 
Um 
Well it’s definitely gone on long enough 
Um 
Enough people have died at this point 
Um 
It doesn’t seem like we’re doing too much by being there 
It just seems like we’re 
Um 
Wasting our power 
Um yeah 
It just seems to me that the war has pretty much proven that it’s not 
Um 
That it’s not gonna end well 
So I figure we might as well just pull out right now and save as many lives as we could and 
I um 
I know that I 
What’s his name? 
Barack Obama is uh 
Democrats are trying to set up some kind of plan to 
Some strategy to get out of Iraq within the next year or two 
But um 
I mean that 
That seems kind of reasonable just cause it’s not too realistic to be able to pull out right away and just send all the troops back at one time because that would probably be impossible 
But I mean if phasing out of troops would be a good solution I think at this point 
But it needs to 
It needs to start soon cause if they just keep talking about it 
They’re just wasting our power over there 
Um 
Yup 
Um 
Yeah 
Um 
Well I’m not 
I haven’t been keeping up to date too much on 
On like everyday occurrences and what’s in Iraq 
But, I know in general it’s been pretty much guerilla warfare on their part 
And um 
That seems like something that you can’t really defend against 
Um 
We 
We’re pretty much just sitting ducks right now 
Just waiting to be killed it seems 
And we’re running what seems a pretty martial law over there 
Um 
Uh 
I don’t know 
It just seems like we need to start bringing troops back as soon as possible and just hope that they get their government up and running soon or some kind of government that we could possibly approve of 
It doesn’t have to be a Democracy 
Just something that is not Saddam Hussein I think 
But um 
Something that could keep the country in general in order 
Um 
No
