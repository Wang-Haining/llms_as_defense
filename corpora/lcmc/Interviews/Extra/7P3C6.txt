Uh yes I think so 
Because a lot has changed since the Catholic Church obviously like established its rules and its 
Uh stipulations 
I think 
Uh 
You know a lot has changed 
People are changing and 
Uh 
It it could turn easily turn people off from joining the Catholic Church when then have these 
You know ancient 
Um 
Rules where you know women can’t become priests or they don’t allow gays in the church 
I think its uh 
They need to change their ways to adapt to uh 
Life in the 21st century yes 

Um 
Yeah I do think some of it could have been prevented 
It’s impossible to say but uh 
I’m sure it would still happen but 
You know had priests been able to marry 
You know they 
He you know would have his wife 
He wouldn’t uh 
Like we we’re all human we all have sexual urges and whether 
When a man becomes a priests those urges don’t just go away 
And if he had a wife it would have helped 
He wouldn’t have had resorted to pedophilia 

Um 
Well 
If a females were allowed to be priests and they were 
They obviously should be allowed to be married as well 
If the if the church allowed females to be priests but um 
I don’t 
I think it’s impossible to say if 
We wouldn’t have had as many cases of pedophilia if women were allowed to be priests 
It’s a little harder but I think that marriage plays a big part 
I think if priests were allowed to be married 
You know not as many cases 
There wouldn’t have been so many cases 

Um 
Well regarding gays I think 
Um 
The Catholic Church considers homosexuality a sin but we’re all sinners 
It’s just there sin is different then ours 
Uh 
You know the Catholic Church preaches about how loving Jesus is and how it’s full forgiveness and 
Uh 
Well Jesus can forgive 
Since the Catholic Church considers homosexuality a sin Jesus should be forgiving the gays of their sin 
I mean just they like 
The Catholic Church sets rules that are like 
Well we consider murder a sin but yet there’s so many church programs in prisons and all over trying to help these people reform and you know see God and they accept murderers and uh 
Like cheaters robbers into their church to try to forgive their sins so why can’t we allow homosexuals 
And you know forgive their sins 

Um 
No
