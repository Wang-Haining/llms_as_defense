Oh 
This is a great question 
Um 
I feel like the American public has been lied to since the beginning 
Even since 911 
Um 
And that 
The war 
Even though 
It’s supposed to be for something great and good 
Um 
Because of the lie that it was started for 
Is just completely wrong 
Um 
If you go and look into 
Like 
The names of the people that said were  
Like 
Even the hijackers on 911 
Most of them are still alive 
And 
If you were really 
Um  
A terrorist 
Planning to take all these people down with you 
So you could have your eternal reward as they say 
Then you would probably make sure that you would do it right so that you died as well 
But the majority 
I think 
Uhh 
I can’t remember the exact number off the top of my head 
But the majority of them still are alive 

And 
Um 
There’s even been data about 
Uh  
How the crash near the Pentagon 
And 
Like 
That damage  
Could not have been caused 
By 
A plane 
Or that 
You know 
When a plane would crash 
There would be so many more different damages to the buildings in the surrounding areas than were  
Were 
Actually reported and seen 

And 
There’s just so many discrepancies between 
Even the official 
Um  
911 commission report 
And 
People’s testimonies 
And 
While I know that eyewitness testimony isn’t always the best thing to rely on 
When there are so many people telling such a completely different story than the 
Quote-unquote 
Official report of what happened 
It’s bound to raise a lot of questions 

And 
I think that also 
It’s taken 
There’s so many people that have died in Iraq 
For something that’s really completely impossible 
Like 
Trying to set up a democracy over there 
Is not even being go 
Gone about 
Like 
In the proper way 
Because 
You know 
In the United States you have the system of checks and balances with the judicial and the executive 
And 
Um  
Just 
You know 
All the different branches of government and things like that 
You make sure that it’s basically impossible 
For a tyrant to come in and just take it over 
And 
Like  
Undo all the democratic work  

But in Iraq there’s no 
Such 
And 
You know 
This budding democracy that everyone is speaking so wonderfully about 
There’s no such system of checks and balances 
It’s completely possible for 
You know  
A tyrant to come in and 
Just undo 
All of the work that has been done 
That all these men and women have given their lives for 

Um 
Basically it’s just 
It’s 
A lot of people have been saying that it’s an excuse for Bush Jr. to go in and 
Succeed where his father didn’t 
And it’s more of a personal thing 
I’ve heard that it’s more for oil 
Than for any sort of high-minded democratic ideals 
And I have to say that I really agree with that 
Because if it were more to 
You know 
Right this wrong 
And all of that 
Then they would have gone about it in a better way 
And would make sure that it couldn’t be 
Just 
Undone by voting in a tyrant 

I think it’s gone on more than long enough 
But I really don’t see any way to repair the damage that has been done in trying to 
Set up 
Like 
New democracy 
And all things like that 
It would take a lot longer to fix what they’ve been building shoddily than 
To 
Than if they had done it right in the first place 
And 
So  
You know 
While I’ll criticize a lot 
The truth is I really am not sure how they can fix it at this point 

Um 
Just that 
The focus has been 
Very random 
And it’s been fueled by 
Um 
Constant reminders of 911 and things like that 
And if you say that you’re opposed to the war in Iraq 
Then you immediately either hear 
One 
You’re unpatriotic 
Or two 
You’re 
Don’t you support the troops 
And it’s completely possible to support the troops 
Like 
I completely feel that they’re 
Incredibly brave and I could never do what they’re doing 
But I do not support the war at all 
And 
I’m very 
Patriotic to a point 
Like 
I love this country 
I just don’t love the current regime 
That 
It’s under 
And  
You know 
I’m aware that 
In a lot of other countries I wouldn’t be able to openly express my disapproval of what’s going on 
And I’m thankful that I’m able to for now 
But 
I still 
Think that the war in Iraq and everything since 911 
All of the incidents 
The terrorism and things like that 
Have been used to give reasons and excuses for things that shouldn’t be possible 
Like 
All of the wiretapping 
And the intelligence 
Um  
Just 
Becoming more and more invasive than it ever has been before 
Since like McCarthyism 
And 
It’s 
Just wrong 

Not particularly
