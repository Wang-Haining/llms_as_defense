Um  
I think that it’s tricky  
Because  
Um  
I know for Myspace if you post something on a bulletin then that means that anybody can see it  
So for that situation I don’t think it was an invasion of privacy  
Because  
That person put up their thoughts on a bulletin  
 
And  
Anybody could see that  
So anybody had the right to see it  
 
So I didn’t think that was an invasion of privacy  
And  
Also  
Um  
I think it was actually for the common good  
 
Because  
Um  
Well if there was a shooting then people would have been killed  
 
So I think that it was  
Since it was public  
And  
Since it helped others I don’t  
I didn’t see that as a big problem  
 
Um  
As for like profiles and such  
I think that’s when you start to tread on invading other’s privacy  
I think that  
Um  
What school officials should do is  
Um  
Have like a list of maybe suspected people like if they think something’s gonna happen  
Also when you put up a profile  
Um  
You allow everybody to see it  
 
And  
I know there’s things that you can set like certain people can’t see certain things on your profile  
So if you set things like that then you know that’s what you’re hiding  
But  
Anything else on your profile should be is open to anybody  
And  
You know that  
 
So I think that when school officials go look at your profiles then technically they have the right to  
But  
I think that  
Um  
School officials should only be looking in cases of  
Um  
Things such as this  
As school shootings  
And  
School related activities  
 
Um  
I don’t really think that they should just be browsing through students profiles  
I just see it that if they could tie it to a school related thing then that’s their right  
And  
They’re also protecting the students  
 
Um  
I think they should draw the line on  
If they have a suspected person then I think they should look at their profile  
But  
I don’t think they should just randomly look at a students profile  
And  
Look through their pictures  
And  
Unnecessary things like that  
 
I don’t I don’t really think that’s necessary to their job  
 
Their job is supposed to be school related activities not after school  
 
So I think if they’re not on like  
If they don’t  
They’re not suspected for anything I don’t think they should  
I don’t think that’s an issue that should be looked into  
 
And  
Um  
And  
But  
As for things like bulletins and stuff that’s like that’s what that person did to themselves  
 
They put it up publicly so  
 
Um  
Not really
