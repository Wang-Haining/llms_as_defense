Um 
I don’t think we should be there 

Um 
I think its gone on way too long 
Um 
I think initially after 911 happened 
Um 
Well I’m from New Jersey so 
Um 
It like personally effected a lot of my friends 
Um 
Who have parents or family members who worked at the world trade center 
Um 
So at first it 
Obviously it was a huge tragedy and very sad for a lot of people and 
Um 
I think like initiating the war in Iraq like was a 
Definitely 
Raised like patriotism in the country but I don’t 
I don’t think we should still be there I think like after 
You know 
We scared them and 
You know 
We caused enough chaos over there 

Overthrew 
Um 
The terrorist government and everything like that and I just don’t think like 
There’s more lives being lost over there then there needs to be and so many like innocent lives and it’s just gone on too long and I think the money 
Our nations money 
Um 
Armed forces and everything like that could be going to a lot better purposes 

Yeah 
Um 
I mean like education is a huge thing in our country 
I mean there are so many parts just in America where kids don’t have the opportunity for education 
It just 
It makes no sense to me that we’re spending billions and billions of dollars on a war oversees in Iraq for 
Not even for 
Oh 
It doesn’t even seem like a real purpose anymore like President Bush whatever he talks about it 
He doesn’t seem to be clear about what exactly we’re doing over there 

Besides we’re there to fight terrorism 
You’re never gonna win a war against terrorism it’s just like a think you’re always gonna have to face as long as there’s evil in the world 
But education definitely is something that you can do something about 
You can take action for and 
Um 
Just like there’s so many urban areas just within the United States 
Or even if you 
If you wanna be international like do something internationally in Africa 
They have no 
Some places have no school systems and maybe that is a better way to fight terrorism then actually fighting 

I really think it should just be stopped 
I think that the point they wanted to prove 
I guess that we won’t be stopped by an act like 911 
Um 
I think they proved that point but now its 
There’s so many young soldiers and 
Um 
My grandmother is buried in a veterans 
Uh 
Cemetery cause my grandpa was in World War II 

But 
Um 
So we went and visited her grave this summer when I was out there and there’s just like a whole wall of people who were killed in Iraq and they’re all like late 20’s early 30’s 

And it’s just 
Its crazy to think that they’re there they’re dying and I don’t know why they keep letting that happen 

So 

Um 
Not too much 

No I think I’m good
