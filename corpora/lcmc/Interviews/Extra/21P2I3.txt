OK  
Well I’m not as much of a politics person  
So I can’t say I read the news everyday and everything  
 
My concept has been I haven’t really heard of a really good reason for going to war with Iraq  
 
I mean at first when we were  
When nine eleven happened  
Um  
I was like for going into Afghanistan looking for Osama Bin Laden  
‘Cause  
I feel he was the one who offended our country  
 
And  
Then when I heard about Saddam Hussein I was  
I didn’t really get a good connection between us being attacked  
And  
Saddam Hussein being really involved  
And  
Um  
So I don’t I don’t really think  
Um  
Bush has come up with a really good reason for going to war with Iraq  
Um  
Also when I heard that  
Um  
His father President Bush Senior  
 
Um  
He had I think  
I don’t know that much  
But  
I heard he  
Um  
He had problems with Iraq  
And  
He always wanted to go after them  
 
So I kind of feel that maybe that means that he’s just trying to fulfill what his father tried to do  
And  
He’s using  
Um  
Terrorism as an excuse  
 
To do so  
So I don’t really think we’ve gotten a good reason  
So because there’s no good reason I think they’re just using our soldiers  
And  
Our money for no good  
Like  
It’s just killing innocent people  
 
And  
 
Sure  
Well  
I mean to go to war it costs millions of dollars  
And  
That’s all being  
You know  
Um  
Sent overseas instead of  
Um  
Us spending money on protecting our own country  
I think a good portion of our money is being sent over to just kill off our soldiers  
And  
Innocent civilians  
  
While we should be concentrating on  
‘Cause  
We’re also going into some sort of recession  
And  
I don’t think this war is helping us  
 
I think it’s definitely gone on long enough  
Um  
I don’t really see a reason for it beginning  
And  
I also heard of this war being referred to as Bush’s Vietnam  
 
And  
Vietnam obviously wasn’t good so I really think that they should stop it as soon as possible  
Because  
It’s a little ridiculous  
 
Uh  
Sure  
Um  
Well I mean I’m not anti war  
I think that war should happen for a reason  
 
But  
Again I mean unless there’s something I don’t know or he’s keeping from us I don’t really see a good reason  
And  
I feel that they’re dra  
If they started a draft that would be even worse  
 
Because  
There’s no reason for people to go overseas  
And  
All you hear really in the news is about soldiers getting killed  
I don’t really hear much about like any progress or  
I just hear about civilians getting killed and soldiers getting killed  
And  
I mean maybe it’s because I haven’t I don’t haven’t looked up a lot about it  
But  
I just feel that if you’re just killing people for no reason then it’s not worth it  
  
Um  
No
