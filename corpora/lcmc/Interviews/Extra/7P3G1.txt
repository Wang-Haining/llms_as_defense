I think the side that opposes gay marriage is wrong because 
It 
There sexual orientation doesn’t make them not human 
I mean all humans have the right to get married 
I mean it’s a 
It’s a way of life and to limit 
To take that right away from someone just because of their sexual preferences is 
I think is wrong 
Even though I personally disagree with homosexuality its 
It’s the person’s choice and they shouldn’t be treated differently just because of their sexual preference 
I mean 
A lot of people like believe that it’s wrong and that they shouldn’t be getting married but they’re 
They’re people they fall in love it doesn’t matter who they’re falling in love with 
They’re in love and if they want to get married they should have that right 
And I think a lot of the present religious views 
Uh 
Play a big part in this because he obviously disagrees with homosexuality so he doesn’t allow allow these people to get married but they’re people none the less and they should be allowed they should have the that human right to get married 

Um 
I think it’s a sin cause I guess well I’m Catholic like so I believe homosexuality is a sin but we’re all sinners 
I mean we we all have the right to get married so why can’t they 
It’s kind of like even though I disagree with the actual being I don’t treat like homosexuality homosexuals shouldn’t be treated any different 
I mean 
It just seems unfair to treat a human different just because of their sexual preference even if you disagree 
We all disagree with different aspects like different characteristics of people but 
I mean we 
You deal with them and they shouldn’t be 
Uh 
They’re uh 
They’re human rights shouldn’t be uh 
Limited because of it 

Um 
I think George Bush has no right to make a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage 
It’s 
It seems uh very like unfair and unreasonable 
I mean 
Why can’t they get married 
What’s his uh reasoning behind it 
It’s 
Um 
I think he has no right to alter the constitution like that 
Um 

Um 
I think they should 
I think it 
I think uh 
Gay marriage should be legalized in every state in the country 
So and I think they have the power to do that 
So instead of just having a few states as of right now that allow gay marriage I think it should be that the whole country should allow it 

Um 
No
