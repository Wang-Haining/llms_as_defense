Hm 
Um 
(pause) 
Its not as much 
Actually in some ways I think it 
This is going to sound very strange 
In some ways I think it might be the other way around now 

Um 
Just from personal experience 
Like my dad works for UPS and he is a financial controller and he 
Like a couple of years ago he was up for a promotion and it was him versus this women and he was definitely more qualified then the women and he had been in the company longer then she had but they hired the women instead 
Um 
He’s still kinda bitter about that 

I think 
I think as a women today if you prove yourself and you have a certain reputation you do end up getting more advantages because its like against the norm 
But it’s not anymore 
Like I feel like there is a lot more equality and 
Um 
There are definitely things though 
Um 
With like 
Um 
One of my friends were talking to me about their business major and they had a business ethics class discussion and it was about 
Um 
It was about gender discrimination in the workplace and if there 
Sometimes they 
He told me like a a lot 
A couple of examples where women weren’t hired because they 
If they were married especially because they could become pregnant then have to go on maternity leave 

Like they weren’t pregnant at the time and its like really had nothing to do with anything but because they were women the men were hired instead 

Just so there would be no chance of that 
And um 
Things like that where typically 
Like specifically like female roles or whatever I think there’s still a lot of discrimination with that 
This is not making sense 
I don’t really know 
(laughs) 

Um 
Yeah 
I 
Um 
I think there’s a lot of stereotypes 

 I think 
Um 
I think you expect 
I don’t know 
I think that stereotype of men being like tough and dominant and respon 
Like uh 
The leader is definitely still present and if you have like a male who would rather 
Um 
I don’t know would be 
I actually I have no idea 
I really don’t know 

Um 

Hm 
Um 
Not really 

Um 
I think 
Oh 
One thing that I 
I don’t know if this is related at all but 
Um 
When you fill out a resume or you do take like a standardized test or apply for college 
I do not think they should ask what your gender is 
I do not think they should ask what your race is 
I think they should look at your credentials and your accomplishments and your grades and things like that and it should not matter if you are male or female or black or white or asian or anything 
It should just be based on how qualified you are 

I think its really really reidiculous how there has to be 
It happens at this school too cause they’re all about like expanding diversity now 
And um 
Like it 
It gets tricky when it comes to things like who is economically able to have more opportunities or whatever in general I don’t think they should ask if you’re a male or a female 

I don’t think it matters 
It shouldn’t matter when you’re picking 
Selecting people to attend a college or 
Um 
Selecting someone for a job that shouldn’t matter if they’re male or female 
It should be who would be better at the job 
So that’s my strongest feeling about that I guess 

Hm 
No
