I think  
Um  
Personally I believe that  
Uh  
Gays should be able to be married  
But  
I think that  
Um  
In our society we haven’t fully separated church and state as of yet  
 
And  
Um  
I think that for me I was thinking about this  
And  
I thought that  
Um  
Maybe they should eliminate the term marriage  
Because  
Technically marriage is a sacrament  
 
And  
If that’s if religious reasons is the true reason behind why they won’t let them marry then why not just change the name to something such as like a civil union or something like that  
Like separate church and state even more  
 
And  
Um  
I think that would make it more acceptable for people who are really religious  
And  
Can’t understand you know why they would have to be married  
Um  
Also  
Um  
I don’t really believe that marriage should be just between a woman and a man  
I just think that it should be an environment where a family can be fostered  
 
And  
I know of many gay people who have  
Um  
Adopted children  
And  
Have lived normal lives  
Just as a man and woman can  
 
And  
Um  
I think that by  
Um  
Such as like highly religious people  
If they say that  
Um  
It’s because of religious reasons and such  
I think that they’re actually  
Um  
Counteracting this  
Because  
As a Christian you’re supposed to  
You know  
Love your neighbor  
And  
Instead they’re just alienating these people  
And  
Making them feel even worse about something that they can’t help  
 
And  
So I think they should be legalized  
I think it should be legalized  
And  
Allowed  
But  
I do think that maybe they should eliminate the term marriage  
And  
Think of something more legal  
 
Sure  
Yeah well  
Um  
You’re supposed to be more accepting  
 
Well if you’re a Christian  
Like the ways of Christ he accepted women who were low in status  
He  
You know  
He accepted the beggars  
And  
Such  
Like  
He just anyone in society he accepted  
 
And  
I just feel that here they’re just they’re not accepting the gay people  
And  
They’re just making them feel like oh you’re still wrong you can’t do this and such  
 
So I think that there’s kind of  
They’re not really following Christian values even though they say that they are  
 
Right  
Um  
I just figure that if that’s the true problem that they have with them then you could just get rid of the term marriage  
Because  
Marriage is a sacrament I know in the church  
 
Um  
I know  
Like I said civil unions or some other term that really didn’t make you think of the church when you heard it  
 
Um  
And  
Of course you can’t marry  
Like the only thing for them is they can’t get married in a church which makes sense  
Um  
I just think that separating the church and state even more would help this issue  
 
Um  
I’m definitely against it  
Um  
I don’t think that’s right at all  
Um  
And  
Of course again this is President Bush  
Um  
Combining church and state  
 
He’s putting his Christian values into  
Um  
Our constitution which is the law  
And  
Um  
I don’t think that’s right  
And  
Um  
So he’s just making us more of a Christian nation  
And  
While in our past we’ve vowed to have a separation of church and state  
But he’s just reversing this I feel  
 
By doing this  
And  
Again he’s not looking like a very good Christian by completely  
That’s a big statement against gay people so  
 
Um  
I don’t I don’t think they should be involved  
Um  
Again  
Because  
They’re bringing it back to being a religious issue  
Um  
I think the only thing they could be involved is just to maybe  
Um  
Change like about not saying marriage by changing the name  
Um  
I think by just tweaking the rules a little bit  
 
I think they can be involved for things like that  
Like  
Um  
What benefits each partner gets which I still think should be the same as married people  
 
But  
I don’t think that they should be against it  
 
No
