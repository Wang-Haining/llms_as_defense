Um 
I think that 

Hold on let me think 

Um 

I think that it does need to change its ways in the way that 
Um 
They shouldn’t like condemn people for doing what they like what they do 
Like they still have the Bible and I think that the Bible will always stay 
You know their main teaching and they can still teach that but instead of saying 
If you don’t do this then 
Um 
If you don’t like 
If you don’t follow the Bible then your absolutely wrong 
Um 
I think that they should say that they accept 
Um 
Like not going with what the Bible says 
Um 
(pause) 
Just because so many people turn away from Catholicism now because they’re 
its so strict and its almost ridiculous 
like to some people I know because I’ve gone to Catholic school for 
um 
13 years before I came here and even in Catholic school a lot of people didn’t agree with it because they felt like what they were doing 
They felt like the Catholic Church was like just basically yelling at them 
So 
Um 
I think they should change 
Some of the things just because 
Be like
Be a little more lenient but still have like 
Teach the Bible and teach the teachings of the Bible just to show that that’s what Catholicism is about 

Um 
(pause) 
Oh well I meant that 
By like still teaching like in church and in classrooms 
Like teach about the Bible 
Like what the Bible says and 
Um 
For instance like 
Um 
Like sex before marriage 
Oh um 
(laughs) 
Like sex before marriage 
Um 
Basically people like so many teenagers feel like if they are 
Taking place in that then they feel like 
Um 
Like they 
Uh 
Are going against their religion 
So 
I 
I mean its kinda weird for the Catholic Church to say that it is ok but I’m just saying like don’t make it seem like 
Um 
Like people are doing so wrong 
For not going with what the Bible says 

Um 
(pause) 
I think that they could have just cause 
Um 
They could 
I mean apparently priests have 
These priests 
Those priests had like pent up sexual energy 
Um 
And it could have been 
If they did have a wife and a family that it could have been released 
But at the same time 
Um 
There are plenty of men who aren’t priests who do the same thing 
So I think that 
Um 
Like I 
Its just hard for the Church to 
Um 
Allow like female members now 
Just cause its 
Female priests I mean 
Um 
Just cause that’s what it has been like for so long 
There hasn’t been male priests 
Like I learned this in 
Um 
School 
That um 
Like for the priests 
For the Catholic Church to now allow 
Um 
Female priests is almost impossible just cause it hasn’t changed for so long so I don’t think that allowing a family would really make a difference in like less 
Um 
Priests that are pedophiles 

Um 
Not really 
No
