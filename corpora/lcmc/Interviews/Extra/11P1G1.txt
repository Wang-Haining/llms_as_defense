Um 
Oh geeze 

Ok let me think 
(pause)
Um 
I don’t think it should be like 
I don’t think it should be like against the law for gay couples to be married 
Um 

Because 
Like 
I 
Hm 
Hold on let me think 

Um 
Uh 
Like personally I 
I don’t believe in gay marriage but if 

Ok 

Ok 
Yeah 
Ok 
Personally I don’t believe in gay marriage 

I just 
I mean 
I don’t know 
I 
I was definitely raised in a family that was 
Um 
Like really strict Catholic 
Went to Catholic high school and everything 
 
And um 
That’s just kind of like 
I have nothing against gay people its just 
I don’t know 
Um 
Just its 
Its weird like I think like you’re supposed to be like able to have children if you’re married and 
Um 
I don’t know 
I just think its 
One thing that really does bother me is 
Um 
Like a lot of gay couples they adopt kids and stuff after they’re married and 
I think that’s just a weird situation for the child because 
Um 
A lot of them 
You know they come from foster homes or they come from backgrounds where they’re not very supported 
They’re not stable especially if they’re older kids and then to have to add having two moms or two dads on top of that I think that’s a little bit uncomfortable for a kid 
Um 
And a lot to handle 
As for the government 
Um 
I don’t think they have the right to tell people not to spend their lives together 
Like 
I mean I may personally be against it but it wouldn’t effect me if like I had neighbors who were 

Gay and who were married 
Um 
I don’t think that’s like 
That’s not the governments responsibility its kinda dictating how people should like 
Giving it like a formula of what people should live like 

And some people choose 
Well no 
Some people are gay and they want to be married 
They find a life partner and good for them 

But and if they want to get married they should they shouldn’t be like unhappy 
They should have every right to 
I don’t think the government should deny that right to them 
But on the whole I don’t even thing it should be an issue but 

No 
I don’t think the federal government should be involved and putting 
Making a constitutional amendment 
The constitution is based on equality and freedom for everyone and if you’re saying oh no these people just because they are homosexual means they can’t marry each other 

I mean looking at it from a church perspective they wouldn’t be able to be married but if they want to be civilly recognized by the law 
I don’t 
I don’t even think that’s the governments place 

Not really 

Sure 
Um 
I guess 
I don’t know that its one specific thing 
I think its 
Its just like I have never been around like 
When I was growing up 
I mean I never 
Like my family didn’t have any friends that were gay couples or anything like that 
It was never like 
I’m not sure 
It just wasn’t part of anything I ever had to face 

Um 
So my parents have like a religious view on it and 
Because of that I just assume the same 
I don’t really have any like direct reason for it 

That’s all I can think of 

Um 
Not really
