Um 
When it first began I believed it was just 
And 
Not because of the whole weapons of mass destruction 
But 
Because 
There was things going on over there that shouldn’t be going on 
And 
There were people in power that shouldn’t have been in power 
Now 
Uh 
I don’t really support it anymore 
Um 
I did in the beginning 
But 
Now I feel like just kind of call it quits 
And 
Just let ‘em do whatever they want 

It’s just kind of just get out of there it’s obviously not working out 
So 
Just drop it 
And 
Leave 

Um 
I feel like what they are trying to accomplish isn’t accomplishable 
Because 
The people over there don’t want it 
Or 
If they do the other people who don’t want it won’t let it happen 
So 
It’s just it’s like a lost cause 

Um 
I don’t know 
That’s all I have
