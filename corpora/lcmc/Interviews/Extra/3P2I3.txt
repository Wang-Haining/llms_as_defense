Hm 
(pause) 
I 
(laughs) 
I don’t know much about the war 
Like 
I haven’t really like followed it and I even said this in one of my questions 
Um 
(pause) 
I 
I don’t know 
I feel that 
Just judging from 
Um 
Just um 
Like seeing how from other people feel about it it seems like its not a very good idea 
I mean I don’t think 
I think war in general 
Isn’t a good idea 
I think to kill people 
Um 
To 
For no like 
Real reason 
Especially when its innocent people who have nothing to do with governments are is 
Like not right and 
Is just 
Just like shouldn’t happen 
Um 
(pause) 
Uh 
Its hard for me to go on about it cause I really like 
Its embarrassing but I really don’t know much about it 

Um 
Just that I 
I personally think that 
Just that 
Its been going on for so long and even though I don’t know much about it like 
I read in the news once that its gonna go longer then world war 2 I think which was 
Like a huge war between 
Like several countries that 
You know people actually supported that it just seems like were there a cause that could never be resolved 
And if it would be 
If it can be I just don’t think that war is the right choice to resolve it and 
Cause plenty of countries are not 
Are changing their mind about a lot 
Um 
Like having alliances with us 
So I just think that its just damaging like the U.S.’s reputation rather then doing good for it 

Its gone on long enough 

Um 
Just cause it seems like that 
Has 
We haven’t been progressing and 
Um 
I mean 
Well with the exception of like 
Saddam Hussein being captured 
Um 
I just don’t think that what we went in to do 
Like it hasn’t 
There hasn’t been any like drastic change in 
What we’ve been trying to like 
Diff 
Make different with 
(pause) 
Um 

No
