OK I didn’t  
I don’t really like the idea  
Um  
Because  
Well ever since I was in grammar school  
Like you get all the drug programs  
 
And like  
So it’s always been like to me it’s very taboo to have drugs  
And  
Um  
I know that they argument is  
Um  
That it has like similar effects to alcohol  
And  
I just don’t feel that it’s right  
Um  
 
I think also that it would have a lot more negative effects  
Because  
Now that it’s only released to people over twenty one I think that would increase the marijuana use amongst adolescents  
Because  
Like drinking they they’d want it more  
Because  
They know they can’t have it  
‘Cause they’re too young  
 
And  
I think by releasing it to the public  
Um  
I think that would cause a ripple of negative effects  
Because  
You would increase the amount of people who are addicted to drugs  
So more people have to go to rehab  
And  
Then also  
Um  
With alcohol like they control like how you can’t drive after you have alcohol  
And  
They have all the tests for it  
I just think that by allowing people to have marijuana that would lead to more accidents on the road  
Because  
More people would drive after  
Could drive after having marijuana  
 
And  
Um  
I think just by releasing it to the general public that would just create more negativity  
Um  
The only thing that I would  
Um  
Support it for is for  
Um  
Medical research  
 
Because  
I know there’s a lot of research going on  
Um  
That has to do with a lot of like pain relieving aspects  
 
And  
I think that  
Um  
The FDA should approve  
Um  
It for medical research  
And  
If it’s proven to actually relieve pain better than other drugs then I think it should be administered to people only with the prescription  
I don’t think that it should just be a casual thing  
I think it should just be a medical treatment  
 
I don’t believe so  
Um  
I can’t say I know  
I can’t say I remember that much from the drug courses  
But  
To me I just think that drugs are addicting  
Um  
I know that people can be alcoholics and such  
But  
I just believe that you can’t be really addicted to alcohol as much  
And  
I think still now there’s like a stigma about drugs  
Like for alcohol its not  
You know  
It’s usually like you have dinner parties  
And  
Cocktail parties  
I think it’s more socially acceptable  
 
But  
I just feel that marijuana’s in a different  
It’s more in like the taboo region of our society  
And  
I don’t see it as like a good thing  
‘Cause  
You can become addicted  
And  
 
Sure  
Um  
Well just on a small level like at a family get together  
You know  
They’ll have wine  
And  
Everything  
And  
They won’t think anything of it  
Um  
And  
Um  
It’s just ingrained in our society  
I think  
Um  
It’s just because you have bars you have like places that are specifically selling alcohol  
And  
It’s everywhere  
And  
I just  
And  
Like adults  
Since it’s also legal for adults they can just  
I never thought it was something that was that taboo for that society  
 
So  
 
Sure  
Um  
I just think that now that it’s not legal I mean I know people have marijuana and such  
But  
I think by making it readily available they’re just gonna increase the amount of people who’re gonna have addictions  
 
And  
Be hooked on marijuana  
And  
Um  
I just don’t think it’s like the same kind of thing as just smoking a cigarette  
Because  
After smoking a cigarette you don’t have the same effects that you have after having marijuana  
 
And  
I just think that especially in car accidents I believe those would rise  
 
If people were smoking marijuana casually  
 
So  
Um  
And then more children would have it  
Because  
It would be readily available  
 
No
