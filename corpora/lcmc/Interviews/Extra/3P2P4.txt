No I don’t think that that is an invasion of privacy 
Um 
Especially in that case 
Um 
It prevent such like a horrible act 
Um 
I think that for all people who have Myspace pages even Facebook pages 
Um 
if your posting something on the internet about yourself it is free for anyone in the world to see 
So 
Um 
For like 
I think that the 
Of all the people who can see it kind of the best would be 
Um 
Like school officials 
Not the best but 
I think you don’t really have to worry that much about school officials cause they are 
You know 
Pedophiles and rapists and 
Um 
Sex offenders out there all looking at pages 
So um 
I think that if you are going to have a page that 
People can see like you shouldn’t be putting things on there anyway that you wouldn’t want 
Certain people to see so I don’t think that that was an invasion of privacy 
I think that they did the right thing 

Um 
(pause) 
Well 
(pause) 
I 
I mean if they hear 
If they like hear talk in school about things that aren’t really hazardous to the school then I don’t think that they should 
Um 
Like if they hear talk about a party 
Or something 

Um 
I don’t think that they should really take action on that 
Just because its an outside school event 
Like it involves the students but its nothing 
Its no extra curricular activity 
You know 

Um 
So I think that that’s where they should draw the line and like hearing people’s conversations 
If its not harmful then they shouldn’t act upon it 

Yes 
You want me to explain more 

Um 
Well if they were to like 
Hear about 
Um 
Talk going around about something bad happening 
Then I think that they should step in 
But if they were to hear something where no ones really being harmed 
Even if they don’t 
Um 
Think that it’s like the best 
For 
Like if something’s going on that’s not like the best for their reputation but no one’s being harmed 
Then I don’t think they should invade people’s privacy 

Um 
Because they saved 
Um 
A bunch of people’s lives 
Like if this kid 
Said I’m going to do this or bring a gun to school on such and such a day 
Um 
I think they had every right to 
You know 
Um 
Act on that 
Um 
There 
Like that was an exact case where someone was going to harm people in the school 
Um 
And it directly involves the admissions and the students that are going there so I think that they had every right to invade 
His privacy 

Um 
No 
Just if these people really didn’t want outsiders 
Like other then their friends seeing these pages then they should make them private 
But that’s all
