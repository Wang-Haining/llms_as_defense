Yes I do think 
I do think it is still an issue 
I think 
Um 
People are still reporting 
Uh 
Incidents of sexual harassment 
Which I consider to be a co-occurring 
Uh 
Event 
I think it’s actually hard to determine why someone 
Uh 
The motivations behind decisions that people make 
So 
I feel that you know we can’t just observe people’s opinion on whether or not they’ve been sexually discriminated 
We have to say 
Uh 
We have to you know kind of find something that’s a little bit easier to get statistics on 
So I think that 
I think that sexual harassment is a good bench marker for that 
I feel that 
Um 
Typically it’s a female problem 
Um 
And 
As in females are the victims of this 
And 
I feel that in trying to do something to remedy it 
The only thing we can do is education in the workplace 
And 
Keep the subject in the forefront of peoples minds so that 
Um 
The discriminators will become aware of the way they act 
I don’t think most of them are aware of their own biases 

Um 
Well I think in order to determine if men are discriminated in the workplace 
I mean 
There are some men who are reporting sexual harassment 
Uh 
So if there are men yes I would say that some men are being discriminated against 
Um 
But 
Beyond that we would have to find a situation in which 
Um 
A female 
Uh 
Is in charge over a man 
And 
I don’t think there are too many 
There’s not a large population of that example 
So I don’t think 
Um 
I’m not sure that we can prove it 
But 
I suspect that there are cases 
I don’t think it’s as much a problem as women 

Regarding men 

I feel that 
Um 
That situations in which a man can be discriminated against are far less frequent than situations in which women can be discriminated against based on gender 
Um 
I feel that the situation requires a person of the opposite gender 
Um 
To be in a controlling position above the person who is being discriminated against 
And 
I don’t think there are a lot of situations in which females are in controlling positions 
Uh 
Over men 
So I think that there are certain isolated situations in that there are men reporting sexual harassment 
However 
I don’t know how common the occurrence is 

No
