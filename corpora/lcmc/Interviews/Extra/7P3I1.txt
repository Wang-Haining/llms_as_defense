Um 
I believe it has been dragged out a little long 
It um 
Considering that the rate of 
Like its 
Fallen their government and we we’ve been stationing troops there a while and things 
They have uh 
Taken elections and they are starting to form their own government and our presence is very controversial and I believe its contributing to a lot of the violence that’s going on there and a lot of the deaths it just 
The death toll keeps climbing and we’re not really making as big of an impact as we think we are and um 
I just believe it’s time that we slowly begin to take our troops out and bring them home because its 
The death toll is just increasing and we’re we’re part of the reason of the violence the United States occupation in Iraq 

Um 
Well because like I guess the political parties there some strongly disagree with the United States and the United States occupancy of Iraq so it’s creating problems like the United States is influence is and issue that the parties are fighting over 
And a lot of people in uh 
In Iraq like citizens are obviously very angry about the United State’s presence in their country and they’re retaliating 
And the retaliation leads to the deaths and bombs and a lot of violence 

I think it’s gone on long enough 
I don’t think it should continue 
I think we should uh gradually take our troops out 
And uh 
Leave Iraq to solve its own problems  
Work it out 

Um 
Well 
I think that at this point it’s kind of 
They’re perfectly capable of solving their 
The conflicting political parties are capable of solving their issues in a diplomatic way 
Not using violence and a lot of the reason why they are using violence is because of our occupancy 
Like if we uh 
Ended the war in Iraq um 
They’re 
It would be more 
Iraq would be a more peaceful country 
I think 
There wouldn’t be as much violence 

Um 
I don’t believe so 
I don’t think
