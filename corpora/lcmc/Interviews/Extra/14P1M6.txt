Um 
So it’s small amounts 
You know 
Like 
For people over twenty-one 
So 
What is it 
If they get pulled over 
And 
Caught on with a small amount of it then they don’t get in trouble at all 
Or 

Um 
Yeah I don’t really agree with it 
It’s yeah it’s made illegal for a certain reason 
It’s said to 
Um 
You know 
Be 
You know 
Marijuana itself might not be that damaging 
But 
It’s a huge gateway drug 
And 
If you’re going to make it legal in any amount then it’s not good 
Because 
It doesn’t matter how much 
I guess 
You’re caught with it’s just the principle that you have it 

Um 
I think whether it’s a little bit 
Or 
A lot it doesn’t really make that much of a difference 
Um 
I could see 
Especially for personal use 
I could see how they could 
You know 
Definitely implement the use in medical situations 
And 
Hospitals 
And 
Such 
Because 
It’s definitely a big help 
But 
I don’t think there should be any 
Uh 
Legality for recreational use for it 
No matter how old you are 
Um 
You know 
Like I said 
Even though it’s not addictive 
It’s said not to be addictive itself 
Or 
That harmful it definitely seems the facts prove that 
Um 
It leads into other worse drugs 
And 
You know 
Where do you draw the line 
How much is a little 
Um 
You know 
The whole age limit thing 
I think you just have to say no altogether about that 

That it should be legal 
Because  
It’s similar to alcohol 
 
Um 
Yeah that’s a 
I just think that people 
It seems 
You know 
There’s obviously both cases 
Yeah there are alcoholics that abuse it 
And 
There’s also people that abuse marijuana 
I guess 
You could put that in comparison 
But 
I think just the whole 
Um 
Just the whole the whole gateway is probably its downfall 
Because 
It’s just the fact that if you’re doing that 
You know 
If a kid’s trying that 
A twenty-one year old say 
Because 
That’s legal 
If they’re trying marijuana for a while 
And 
They want to move onto some bigger things 
I don’t think alcohol is that influence 
I think alcohol is just 
You know 
You can 
It seems like you can stay with that 
You can stay with alcohol without really forcing you into some other types of drugs 
And 
Stuff 
So 
I think that’s the difference between the two 

But 
As far as the effects 
Um 
Yeah I guess I guess 
You could say they have similar effects in that 
You know 
I guess 
Um 
When monitored 
When 
Like 
Or 
When 
Like 
Regulated 
And 
When not abused they both have the same kind of effects 
I guess 
You could say 

Yeah 
Um 
You know 
I know 
Um 
I can’t think of it off my head which disease it really helps with 
Do you know 
Or 
I’m trying to think what they use it for 

Yeah cancer patients 
And 
Something 

Yeah for the pain 
And 
Something else it’s really being used 
Um 
Not narcolepsy 
Or 
Yeah I forgot what it is 
It’s definitely for the pain 
And 
You know 
I’m thinking if it’s controlled 
Like 
Any other drug within within the hospital 
Or 
Within the prescriptions  
Then I think it should definitely be 
Um 
Legal in that situation 
Because 
It is helping a lot 
Like 
You know 
I know 
I’m thinking if one of my grandparents 
Or 
Whatever 
Was in huge pain I wouldn’t want them suffering like that 
So 
I would want them to be able to use it 
So 

It’s gonna help 
And 
You know 
If it’s monitored just 
Like 
Any other drug that’s prescribed 
It can be abused 
But 
You just have to 
You know 
Give prescriptions out 
And 
Watch how much you use 
And 
Stuff 
Like 
That 
So 
I think it can be used in a good way 

Um 
Yeah no that’s about it 
I just think 
You know 
The fight for 
Maybe 
Pushing it to be used legally in 
Um 
The medical use is ok 
But 
For recreational use I don’t think it should be done
