No I don’t think that in that situation that it is an invasion of privacy 
I feel that Myspace 
Uh 
When you post a bulletin your intention is to broadcast your thoughts and ideas to a wide group of people 
Um 
If the person had intended their actions to remain private they would have not posted a bulletin 

I feel that 
Um 
At the very least if somebody’s actions are trying to 
Um 
Make public a certain fact or bit of information 
As in creating a webpage and allowing everybody access to it 
Or 
Posting a message on a bulletin board system 
Your intention is to share that information with a lot of people 
And 
I feel that 
Um 
If that information is used to prevent a bad 
Uh 
Situation from happening I don’t think it’s an invasion of privacy 
Because 
By posting that information in a public venue the person is does not consider that information to be private 

I feel that I know in certain situations students have been 
Uh 
Suspended 
Or 
Um 
Received a punishment for 
Um 
Behaviors that happened outside of school such as drinking alcohol 
And 
That information was achieved by look at pictures online with the people in them drinking alcohol 
I feel that 
Um 
I feel that when the effects of the information affect the school environment directly it is not 
Um 
Out of line 
If the if the 
Um 
If the school is somehow trying to control the student’s life in a more general way as it happens outside of school 
And 
They’re employing automated methods to achieve this it’s not quite 
It’s an invasion of privacy 

No
