I think 
I think that 
Um 
Marriage has two senses 
Uh 
Now in American society 
I believe that one can be married inside of a church in which you’re making a spiritual bond between yourself and your partner and god 
And 
I feel that there’s another sense of the word in which the government provides benefits to those who are married 
You get tax benefits 
And 
Things of that nature 
So 
I feel that gay people should be given the right to enjoy the benefits of our government that our government affords to married people 
I don’t feel that 
Um 
I don’t think they should be able to get married in a church 
Or 
Part of a catholic ceremony 
Because 
The catholic church does not recognize that 
But 
The government is supposed to be separate from 
Uh 
From church 
So 
As a result I think it’s wrong to deny somebody what I believe to be a basic 
Uh 
Human right 

As I said before I don’t think the federal government should be involved in this issue 
I believe that the first problem was 
Uh 
Ya know 
Giving benefits to people who are married 
As marriage previously I believe was 
Um 
More of a religious concept in a sacramental sense 
Um 
I don’t think President Bush has a right to prevent this 
I think it’s a fear based response 
Um 
People who are afraid that somehow people will be marrying their dogs 
Or 
Civilization will fall down because of something that I believe to be in it’s basis a very positive and society forming concept 
That you’ve 
Uh 
Found in another person 
Uh 
Something as important as what you’ve found in yourself 
And 
That you are responsible for that person 
And 
Um 
Would like everybody to know that you love that person 
I don’t think that these base ideas are wrong in anyway 
So I don’t under 
I can only see that prohibiting people from exercising this as something that will separate us more than unite us as humans 

Nope
