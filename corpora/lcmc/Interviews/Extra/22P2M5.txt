I don’t know I feel that 
Um 
Marijuana is legal in some parts of the world 
I feel that it will become an individual decision how they want to handle 
Um 
The use of marijuana 
I don’t feel that in and of itself it is any more deadly than the chemicals that are legal now 
Uh 
For public consumption like alcohol or 
Um 
I guess tobacco 
I feel 
Um 
I feel that if you’re giving the individual the freedom to make that decision it’s a good thing 
Um 
As for personally I don’t think I will partake 

I don’t feel 
It’s a function of quantity 
I think that people can impair themselves with a large quantity of alcohol 
And 
I feel that people can impair themselves on a large amount of marijuana 
Uh 
I also feel that the effect of the chemical in individuals is different 
One person will not affect the same 
Will be affected the same way as another person 
So 
Um 
To say that they are similar 
Yes they both impair somebody 
But 
It is the persons responsibility to monitor 
Just as in alcohol 
It’s the persons own responsibility to realize when they’ve become impaired 
Which I find to be the crux of the situation 

No
