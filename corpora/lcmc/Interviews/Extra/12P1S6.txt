Gender discrimination /
Um /
I think discrimination is always an issue and gender discrimination will always probably be an issue /
Um /
Just for the simple fact that you could never eliminate racism or prejudices completely because its it’s a part of society /
Um /
I don’t think /
I think our country’s come a long way from how it used to be with discrimination against genders and I think that its still trying to do its best at preventing discrimination but /
Um /
There’s really /
I think its just something that can never ever be eliminated completely where it will never exist just because it’s a part of society and it just one of those /
I guess things that plagued societies forever /
[so um being that its still present today what do you think we can do to change that]
Um /
I mean I know /
I know a lot of things /
I mean a lot of things /
I’m a /
I’m a business major so I know a lot of things in the business world have have changed like certain things you can say and how you have to refer to other people and /
I mean certain things can be taken out of context and things like that and /
And I mean I think /
I think those things have changed the way people treat each other and the way people interact and uh /
I /
I uh /
I think that as far as doing more /
Um /
I guess trying to to put in /
Uh /
Uh /
Its really hard because /
If someone would say right now we have /
Um /
What is it equal opportunity for like all students /
And it kinda like /
It kinda eases it for minority students to be accepted into schools and /
And I mean /
That’s /
That’s an issue in itself /
I mean if you /
If people were to start doing that for jobs or /
Or things like that /
As gender and they started /
They started making it easier for people who were discriminated against to get jobs and making it harder for /
For people who weren’t discriminated against to get a job /
I mean that’s a debate that /
I mean I can’t really decided if its right or not /
Um /
I think our /
I think our society does do a lot already /
Um /
Maybe an idea would be to do something like like lowering /
I mean lowering qualifications for potential employees but /
I guess making it making there maybe has to be a certain amount of /
I really don’t know /
I have no clue /
[ok well do you feel that men are ever discriminated against in the workplace or otherwise]
Um /
I think men can be discriminated against especially /
Um /
Like sexual orientation /
Or um /
Personal interests /
Um /
I think /
I think maybe discrimination can be confused with /
I don’t know with maybe with race or just someone is unpopular /
I mean I /
You look at /
You look at a school and you see that there’s just like the kids that are supposedly really popular and the kids that aren’t and they’re made fun of and treated badly or whatever /
And I’m sure it can’t /
I’m sure it’s similar in the workplace /
I I really don’t know /
I don’t really have a job but I mean if there’s people that /
If there’s a few people that a man who just isn’t popular and people perceive him to be /
I don’t know /
I guess they /
He doesn’t have the same interests and people just pick on him /
That could be considered discrimination to even if there’s /
Even if he’s the same as everyone else /
He has different interests so /
I think anyone can be discriminated against /
I mean man or women /
Black or white any race /
[ok and I mean do you feel that they are in the US today at all]
What /
Discriminated against /
[yeah]
Oh yeah /
I /
Definitely /
I think that discrimination is never ever gonna be /
I don’t think it will ever ever /
It will ever be eliminated just because it’s a plague of society that can’t really become /
It can’t really overcome /
[ok any other thoughts]
Uh /
I think I /
Eh /
No /
[ok end of interview]
