Um 
I still think it’s an issue but it’s not as prevalent as it uh used to be 
I think that uh 
Times are definitely changing 
Women are very much more accepted in like the workplace and uh having careers not just staying in the home 
It’s um 
Really uh 
Like a lot uh has been done to promote like women in the workplace 
I mean its its very much accepted now although in some areas obviously disagree with it 
But I think it’s a minority of people that do disagree with it and I think that it was the way 
Probably the way they were raised that 
You know caused them to think that well women can’t work or have careers and um 
That’s why they discriminate against them just it’s just because of the way they were raised 
But in reality I think the majority of the population knows that women can do exactly what men do and that 
You know you shouldn’t discriminate 
I think racial discrimination is more of an issue then gender discrimination in the country 

Um 
I think that if it 
Um 
If in a workplace it’s if its like established as an issue 
Like if 
Between employees with the gender discrimination those employees who are discriminating against women or men they should be uh 
Uh like go to programs or workshops that 
You know try to break those prejudices and stereotypes down till the person like sees 
Can physically see and know that they could be taught that 
You know women can do just this and 
You know they should be taught how to treat the other gender in the workplace 

Um 
I mean I’m sure there are uh cases 
Specific cases where men have been discriminated against 
Although I don’t think it’s a major issue 
I don’t think it happens to often 
I think it happens 
Discrimination happens more to women then it does to men 
But um 
The same case if a male is being discriminated against in the workplace by a women then that women should be uh taught 
You know go to courses or whatever that teach how to treat the men in the workplace 
She should be taught that that males just as 
You know important as she is and she can’t discriminate against him like that for 
It’s no good reason 

Um 
No
