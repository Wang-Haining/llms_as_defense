Oh my goodness yes 

Um 
Yeah definitely 
Um 
The Catholic Church I don’t think 
I don’t even think they’re in this century at all 

Well 
I can say things in my church like back home 
Um 
I’ve had like a couple of conversations with my mom about this 
How people only go to church if its Christmas or Easter 

They 
And like if you go to regularly 
You can’t even get a seat on Christmas and Easter even if you go every single week because everybody else comes 
And the priests at my church are definitely 
They’re 
They’re weird 

They’re not like 
I don’t know 

Yeah 
Um 
I would not go to them for guidance or anything like that 

I can think of a million people before them 
I mean 
I 
Obviously I’m not close with them at all but if I were close with them I would still go to a million people before I would talk to them because they just don’t seem helpful 
They seem kind of corrupt 
 
And um 

Uh 
They’re just very 
Well I had this one priest at my high school and 
Um 
It was kinda when that whole scandal with the priests was going on with molesting kids and everything and he just seemed like he fit in right there with it 
And um 
He didn’t 
He didn’t do anything to like make you feel comfortable in his presence and I don’t think that’s what a priest should be 

Um 
But yet there was a teacher at my school who actually 
Um 
Became like a minister in 
Um 
Maybe a Presbyterian church or something like that 
Um 
But she used to be with the Catholic Church but because they won’t allow women to be ministers or priests or anything like that 
Um 
She left 
Um 
I also think like that they should allow priests to be married 

Um 
Because a lot 
A lot of things that priests deal with are 
You know 
They counsel people on family issues and 
Um 
They marry people and if they’re not married themselves I don’t understand how they can give advice to people 

Um 
When they obviously have no idea what they’re talking about 

And I just don’t think that’s 
That’s not 
That’s not a good way to spread their faith or spread a message like 
Because there’s no relation between the two people 

Um 
I think that the Church needs to 
Um 
Hmm 
I’ve never actually thought about this like in depth 
Um 
I think they need to 
Um 
Be a little more 
Hmm 
More open to change 
Um 
With things like 
Um 
Like divorce 

Like about 
You know you can’t really 
You can go to Church but they look down upon remarriage 

Um 
Sometimes it just doesn’t work out 

So sometimes it 
You think that you’re right when you marry somebody and you’re not a couple of years later 

Or a lot of years later and 
Its 
It seems like the church would rather you stay in a bad marriage where you’re unhappy 
Then find happiness somewhere else 
And I thought the whole goal of following religion was like 
To find a fulfilling life 

So I don’t think that they should be so closed minded and even with things like 
Um 
I don’t know just some of their rules are very weird 

I had nuns um as teachers in my high school because I went to a Catholic high school 

Um 
And my parents also went to Catholic high schools 
They had nuns too and obviously they said nuns are a lot nicer then they used to be 
But um 
The same things with the nuns as the priests they 
I feel like they can’t really relate like 
I just think the Church needs to change where 
There’s 
More 
More 
I don’t know 
Get people more involved and I was sitting 
When I went to church this Sunday here at school 
And 
Um 
The homily was about 
Um 
Helping other people and showing compassion and all I could think about while I was sitting there was we’re all sitting there in 
You know 
Nice clothes 
Um 
Obviously we go to Loyola 
Um 
You know 

Like 
A lot of the kids here are pretty well off financially 

Um 
Everybody is sitting there nodding their head like oh yeah I hear you 
But when the basket comes around for a donation even 
Nobody gives anything and nobody 

Yeah 
And nobody 
Um 
Like the 
The priests or any of the ministers like 
People who represent the church don’t do anything about it 
They’re just like 
They 
They 
Week to week they just stand there as the people are giving so much money and so much time but 
Like people are just sitting there 
If they did something where they didn’t make it seem 
I guess sometimes I get the impression that 
If you want to follow religion and follow the Catholic Church you have to give up everything and be 
Um 
This 100% giving person 

All the time 
And totally unselfish 
And then you’ll be considered ok in the Church’s eyes 

Um 
But from my living experience like 
You need to think about yourself too and you need to treat yourself well and then you can treat others well 
And I don’t think that at all is 
I think that’s like somewhat the opposite of what the church says these days 

Like they’re all about 
Um 
Charity and then there’s all those like evangelist people 
And I had somebody come up to me in Boulder the other day 
Um 
They had this brochure for Catholics 
Catholic evangelist or something where you went around the country saw all these amazing things but like I would never do that because 

Because they just make it they make it so overly 
Like zealous 
Where 
Um 
Its just like 
I fee like you would be there the whole time just praying rather then 
Maybe helping other people out or just being a good person 
I don’t understand why the church always has to put that extra aspect of 
Um 
Bow down to everything like give it all up 

Um 
Yeah so 
They just need to be more down to earth and realize the way people live today 

And be open to that and give them more ways to help out other people and to be participating in this world as a Catholic 
Um but without making you feel like if you don’t go on some sort of Evangelical trip that you’re a horrible person 

Yeah I think a lot of the sterotypes about priests are because they’re so 
you know 
its been that way for centuries they know whats gone on 
um 
people feel that way about priest because they’re right and um 
if they let priests marry or they let women be priests 
um 
if goes back to where people would be able to related to that more 
and not 
you know 
make this generalization about all priests 
some of the priests that like I’ve have met in my life are really really nice people and they are helpful but then the few that give them the whole reputation 
um 
its hard to not listen to that because they’re all alike 

Like they all do follow those same rules and have the same vows and everything like that 
So its hard not to hear when you hear about one priest 
Um 
Being 
Like molesting a child or 
Um 
Doing any kind of corrupt 
Corrupt acts 
Um 
Its hard not to be like oh well maybe they all do that 

Cause they’re 
There’s no diversity and 
They’re all like living the same way 
I don’t know 

No not really

GAY MARRIAGE
Um 
Oh geeze 

Ok let me think 
(pause)
Um 
I don’t think it should be like 
I don’t think it should be like against the law for gay couples to be married 
Um 

Because 
Like 
I 
Hm 
Hold on let me think 

Um 
Uh 
Like personally I 
I don’t believe in gay marriage but if 

Ok 

Ok 
Yeah 
Ok 
Personally I don’t believe in gay marriage 

I just 
I mean 
I don’t know 
I 
I was definitely raised in a family that was 
Um 
Like really strict Catholic 
Went to Catholic high school and everything 
 
And um 
That’s just kind of like 
I have nothing against gay people its just 
I don’t know 
Um 
Just its 
Its weird like I think like you’re supposed to be like able to have children if you’re married and 
Um 
I don’t know 
I just think its 
One thing that really does bother me is 
Um 
Like a lot of gay couples they adopt kids and stuff after they’re married and 
I think that’s just a weird situation for the child because 
Um 
A lot of them 
You know they come from foster homes or they come from backgrounds where they’re not very supported 
They’re not stable especially if they’re older kids and then to have to add having two moms or two dads on top of that I think that’s a little bit uncomfortable for a kid 
Um 
And a lot to handle 
As for the government 
Um 
I don’t think they have the right to tell people not to spend their lives together 
Like 
I mean I may personally be against it but it wouldn’t effect me if like I had neighbors who were 

Gay and who were married 
Um 
I don’t think that’s like 
That’s not the governments responsibility its kinda dictating how people should like 
Giving it like a formula of what people should live like 

And some people choose 
Well no 
Some people are gay and they want to be married 
They find a life partner and good for them 

But and if they want to get married they should they shouldn’t be like unhappy 
They should have every right to 
I don’t think the government should deny that right to them 
But on the whole I don’t even thing it should be an issue but 

No 
I don’t think the federal government should be involved and putting 
Making a constitutional amendment 
The constitution is based on equality and freedom for everyone and if you’re saying oh no these people just because they are homosexual means they can’t marry each other 

I mean looking at it from a church perspective they wouldn’t be able to be married but if they want to be civilly recognized by the law 
I don’t 
I don’t even think that’s the governments place 

Not really 

Sure 
Um 
I guess 
I don’t know that its one specific thing 
I think its 
Its just like I have never been around like 
When I was growing up 
I mean I never 
Like my family didn’t have any friends that were gay couples or anything like that 
It was never like 
I’m not sure 
It just wasn’t part of anything I ever had to face 

Um 
So my parents have like a religious view on it and 
Because of that I just assume the same 
I don’t really have any like direct reason for it 

That’s all I can think of 

Um 
Not really

IRAQ WAR
Um 
I don’t think we should be there 

Um 
I think its gone on way too long 
Um 
I think initially after 911 happened 
Um 
Well I’m from New Jersey so 
Um 
It like personally effected a lot of my friends 
Um 
Who have parents or family members who worked at the world trade center 
Um 
So at first it 
Obviously it was a huge tragedy and very sad for a lot of people and 
Um 
I think like initiating the war in Iraq like was a 
Definitely 
Raised like patriotism in the country but I don’t 
I don’t think we should still be there I think like after 
You know 
We scared them and 
You know 
We caused enough chaos over there 

Overthrew 
Um 
The terrorist government and everything like that and I just don’t think like 
There’s more lives being lost over there then there needs to be and so many like innocent lives and it’s just gone on too long and I think the money 
Our nations money 
Um 
Armed forces and everything like that could be going to a lot better purposes 

Yeah 
Um 
I mean like education is a huge thing in our country 
I mean there are so many parts just in America where kids don’t have the opportunity for education 
It just 
It makes no sense to me that we’re spending billions and billions of dollars on a war oversees in Iraq for 
Not even for 
Oh 
It doesn’t even seem like a real purpose anymore like President Bush whatever he talks about it 
He doesn’t seem to be clear about what exactly we’re doing over there 

Besides we’re there to fight terrorism 
You’re never gonna win a war against terrorism it’s just like a think you’re always gonna have to face as long as there’s evil in the world 
But education definitely is something that you can do something about 
You can take action for and 
Um 
Just like there’s so many urban areas just within the United States 
Or even if you 
If you wanna be international like do something internationally in Africa 
They have no 
Some places have no school systems and maybe that is a better way to fight terrorism then actually fighting 

I really think it should just be stopped 
I think that the point they wanted to prove 
I guess that we won’t be stopped by an act like 911 
Um 
I think they proved that point but now its 
There’s so many young soldiers and 
Um 
My grandmother is buried in a veterans 
Uh 
Cemetery cause my grandpa was in World War II 

But 
Um 
So we went and visited her grave this summer when I was out there and there’s just like a whole wall of people who were killed in Iraq and they’re all like late 20’s early 30’s 

And it’s just 
Its crazy to think that they’re there they’re dying and I don’t know why they keep letting that happen 

So 

Um 
Not too much 

No I think I’m good
