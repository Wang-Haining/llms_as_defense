Um 
I definitely think that there is still gender discrimination 
Um 
 I think that in like workplaces and 
Um 
Like just in regular companies men are still always the head 
Like the CEO’s or the presidents of companies 
And like there are rarely women even though a lot more women are going to college 
Um 
Uh 
And I think that 
Women will just always be seen as 
Um 
Like lower as the lower 
As the 
Um 
If your erased to men 
Just cause that’s the way it’s been for awhile and 
Um 
I think that even like all 
The highest class 
Like a high class successful women can still be and is still 
Um 
Could be verbally assaulted by 
On the street by a man who is 
Much lower class 
Um 
Like less paying job 
Much more less successful 
Um 
And I think that even at 
Um 
Like in in the workplace 
I feel like bosses who are male can 
Easily take advantage of female clients cause they feel like since we’re females are tended to be more emotional 
That we would never 
That most women won’t stand up for themselves and 
I just believe that it still takes place and to change it 
Um 
(pause) 
I think 
Um 
(pause) 
I don’t really know what would change it 
I feel like just time and just more 
Just hopefully women becoming more prominent in businesses and proving that they are stronger would 
That’s the only thing that would really change it 
I don’t think there’s any like 
Um 
Like instant change 
Instant like move that could change 
How women are treated differently 

Um 
(pause) 
I’m sure they are 
Esp 
Like 
Probably less 
Just less manly men 
Or how you would say it 
Like more 
Um 
Effeminate men are probably more discriminated but I don’t think that 
Unless they had like a physical problem with them that they are as discriminated as women are 

Um 
Like 
Just a man who seems 
Actually 
Kind of like a man who seems like he has female qualities like 
Um 
Is 
Probably more into the way he looks 
And maybe the way 
You know 
His gestures 
They way he talks 
If its more like a female I’m sure that he would be discriminated 
By other males 

Um 
(pause) 
No
