Ok 
Yup 
Um 
The Catholic Church 
I don’t think they have to do anything honestly 
I mean it’s up to 
I feel like it’s up to the people to decide if they agree with what they’re doing 
Like a lot of people like the Catholic Church because they just never change or just seems like a place that 
Just something that’s been long lasting 
And something that’s reliable 
A lot of people view it that way I think 
But, I mean if you don’t like what the church is doing like not letting women be priests and stuff like that and not updating too much 
Like pretty much the only change they’ve made over like 
Since they’ve been around 
The biggest change they’ve made was 
Um 
Having mass in the 
What do you call it? 
In the regular language 
In like common language instead of Latin 
Like that seems like the only big thing that’s changed 
But, if you don’t agree with something that they’re doing I just feel like you should 
Don’t have to 
I don’t know you don’t have to agree with that 
The church should be able to do whatever they want 
But, um 
People should just realize that it’s not like something you have to be part of 
Um 
Well I 
I just feel like it’s your own choice 
I personally choose not to 
I’ve pretty much stopped 
I stopped going to church when I 
Right after Confirmation actually 
And about once I started high school 
Just cause I felt like it was just outdated 
Um 
Outdated stories from the Bible that they were 
I don’t know 
It just seemed like very outdated to me 
And um 
They 
They just don’t seem to be keeping up on the times and they don’t seem to do the right thing when it comes around like 
Like the whole policy of non intervention when they 
During the Holocaust and stuff like that makes you think like is the church actually doing what they should be doing? 
Um yeah 
Um 
Hmm 
Well, I don’t know 
I don’t really understand if men that just happen to be pedophiles become priests or if becoming a priest leads them to pedophilia 
But, either way I don’t know if like 
If you don’t know that it doesn’t seem like you could know if letting women into the church would help because 
I don’t know 
Like if you let women into the church or just expanded it a little bit 
You can’t really know if it would stop because it’s never been done 
Um 
Well what was part of the question there? 
It was like women and? 
Yeah um 
Well I guess giving like a psychological test or whatever before you could become a priest 
Maybe that would help keep out some 
Um 
Pedophiles I guess 
Um 
If women were 
If they were to change it to allow women to be priests 
It seems like it would slow down 
Like it doesn’t seem like they would have a good reason to be pedophiles 
But, if they’re already pedophiles like they’re not just gonna change because women are around 
Um 
No not really 
I just feel like people should really, really step back for 
If they’re very religious or not too religious 
But still consider themselves Catholics  
I think they should just step back and take a broad look at everything that the church stands for 
And what goes on and just really decide if they want to be part of that 
It just seems like too many people just don’t question them at all and just are blind followers 
But, I don’t know 
Uh no 
Alright
