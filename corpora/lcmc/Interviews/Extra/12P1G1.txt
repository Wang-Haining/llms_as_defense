Um 
I think 
I think both sides have an equal 
Equal argument for what they want 
Um 
I think the reason some have opposed gay marriage is because 
Many conservative people in their states don’t necessarily conform with a belief that homosexuals should have any type of rights at all 
Um 
But I think other states 
Um 
Are starting to feel like the pressure of a rising gay population and they feel that they need to do something but 
Personally I don’t really think that 
That the states should start interfering in matters of marriage 
I don’t know 
I guess I always thought of church and state being separated but 

I never thought of marriage as really an issue outside of church but I guess for for gay people they have to 
They have to go to the state because most churches probably won’t even allow that 

Um 

I don’t think either side either side is right or wrong 
I think there’s good arguments both sides can make 
Um 
I think that necessarily allowing it or not allowing it will effect the state one way or the other 
I think if the state allows it then 
Um 
I guess more of the population would be better content but 
Um 
I guess at the same same token I guess another part of the population would be less content and 

I mean I’m sure some people might feel that it it undermines some some I guess straight people 
Heterosexual people think that uh 
It undermines their marriage because they define marriage as between a man and a women so 
I guess it depends on which way you look at it 
Personally I don’t think it matters either way 

Um 
I think that the government has to I guess take some type of action 
Because there’s been such a strong I guess 
I don’t know voice for 
For and against gay marriage 
Um 
I think President Bush is doing what he thinks he needs to do  
Um 
I don’t know if necessarily banning gay marriage is the right thing but 
At the same sense 
Um 
I mean he’s 
I guess President Bush is trying to figure out whether or not 
Um 
I guess he’s going for 
I guess that marriage between a man and a women 
It should never ever be between two people of the same sex 

He’s trying to pass an amendment that’ll stop that 
I don’t know 
I don’t know if that’s the right thing or the wrong thing 
Um 
I guess the majority of the population probably will feel it’s the right thing but who knows in 20 years if people will still feel that way 

Um 
Sure 
Uh 
I think that the federal government maybe as a whole 
Not just in the single sense of President Bush 
Um 
Maybe the Supreme Court of higher authority or at least equal authority to the president should have some 
Some influence as to the as to the decision 
Whether or not it should be allowed 
Um 
I think the country is making a mistake if they just allow President Bush to to I guess pass his beliefs just because the government’s run by republican’s now it probably would get passed so 

 I think 
I think maybe the issue shouldn’t be brought up within the House of Representative but maybe within the Supreme Court or some other some other way 
I don’t really know 

Um 
Not really 
It doesn’t really pertain to me so I really have no thoughts either way
