Ok 
So 
You’re asking me if 
Um 
If what was an invasion of privacy 

No I don’t believe that was an invasion of privacy at all 
Um 
You know 
I’m not sure exactly how Myspace works 
But 
I have a good idea 
It’s 
You know 
It’s public 
You know 
Whatever’s on the internet it’s public information 

So 
You know 
I think you probably need another Myspace login to look at this information probably 
But 
If they’re putting it out there on Myspace then they should expect that 
That’s the point of it 
If someone else comes across it 
It’s not secure 
And 
It’s not private 
And  
I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy at all 

And 
Um 
Yeah 
Even if 
You know 
Even if it was on something 
A conversation between friends 
Or 
Or 
Even 
Like 
You know 
Something that wasn’t as public as Myspace 
I think if it’s if it involves a school shooting then 
I think that’s just taking the safety means necessary to avoid it 
So 
I don’t think that would be an invasion of privacy either 

Well I think 
Um 
If they’re going out of they’re way to 
Um 
You know 
Monitor every student 
And 
Um 
Check 
You know 
Obviously they shouldn’t be checking their emails 
Or 
Listening to phone conversations 
Or 
Stuff like that 
But 
Um 
If they have suspicion about something I think should be able to do 
You know 
Do all means necessary to avoid the situation 
And 
Um 
Looking on Myspace is just an example of how that should be legal 
So 

Um 
Yeah I mean 
I think it just gives them the right 
Whether that you 
They overhear a conversation about something 
Or 
Um 
The like 
But 
Myspace I think is definitely fine 
That’s not an invasion of privacy 

Yeah 
If they have reasonable 
You know 
Even without reasonable suspicion I think they should be able to look at Myspace just 
Because 
It’s out there for the public 

So 
That’s no 
That’s just 
You can search that 
Or 
Whatever 
But 
If you have a reason of suspicion then I think 
You know 
Maybe 
They could obviously take it up with the police department 
Obviously take it up with the law first 
Not just do it on their own 
But 
Maybe 
Start looking at emails 
Or 
Um 
Something along those lines 
Or 
Just 
Kind of 
Monitor the person a little bit 
But 
You know 
They shouldn’t just 
Um 
Be very 
Um 
You know 
About every student checking every day to make sure 
But 
You know 
If they have suspicion then I think they should try to avoid the situation 
So 

I think 
You know 
The whole Facebook thing 
Um 
The same thing 
It’s kinda
Like 
You’re putting your information out there for it to be seen 
Now 
You know 
As far as this school I know there’s a little controversy about 
Um 
If someone has 
You know 
Alcohol in their picture  
And  
They’re under twenty-one they could be charged against that 
Now I think that’s a little out of hand 
I think 
Um 
You know 
Maybe 
If they were caught first 
And 
Then there’s evidence from pictures from that night 
Somehow you can prove that they’re that night 

Then maybe that could be used 
But 
I don’t think that they should be proactive in going out of their way to try to crack down on 
Um 
You know 
Illegal activity through the my 
Though Facebook 
And 
Myspace I think if it happens 
You know 

Then you could use it 

Um 
That’s probably it
