OK  
Um  
I think they do  
Because  
Um  
They’re very much behind the times  
And  
I think our society is beginning to disclude them when they’re considering like  
Um  
Like deciding on what to do with certain matters  
They just hear their opinion  
But  
They don’t ever really follow it  
And  
I think they’re becoming very ancient  
Such as like with stem cell research and such  
I think they’re just ignoring new possibilities  
And  
I think that in the end if they keep on doing things like this they’re just gonna  
Um  
Their followers aren’t  
They’re just going to drop the religion  
Or  
It’s gonna be very detrimental to their  
Um  
Their like existence in our society  
 
And  
Um  
As with other things  
Like with priests not being able to get married  
And  
I think it’s a little ridiculous that they don’t allow them to  
Because  
There’s other religions that have like ministers 
And  
Things like that that can have families  
And  
I think this also limits  
Um  
What like who’s going to become a priest  
 
Because  
I know  
Well  
I’ve heard of like  
Like it’s hard to recruit people to become priests  
Because  
They know they can never have a family  
And  
Such  
And  
Um  
So I think that if they made them get married  
I think a lot more people would consider that profession  
And  
Um  
As with like  
Um  
The pedophile issue and everything like that  
 
I think that if they allowed them to become priests I think they can actually be more selective as to who becomes a priest  
Because  
Now there’s more applicants  
And  
I think  
Um  
By not allowing them to marry they sometimes like they’re attracting like the wrong kind of people  
 
And  
Um  
 
Sure  
Um  
I just think well  
I talked to like some of my friends who aren’t catholic  
And  
When they describe their religion they just say that it’s just less strict  
And  
I think that people who are liberal and everything they don’t want to hear their opinions just being crushed upon  
 
And  
Told that it’s wrong and everything  
So I think that they would find it easier to turn to another religion that’s not as strict  
And  
Has like more up to date views  
 
Of what kind of views  
 
Um  
Well one of my roommates is Lutheran  
 
And  
I didn’t know much about it  
But  
That’s how she just explained it to me  
Um  
She just said they’re less strict  
Uh  
I didn’t go into detail with her  
 
But  
I just know that another one of my friends is Methodist  
And  
They say the same thing  
So  
 
Mm hmm  
 
Um  
 
Right I think that would change  
Um  
For females I think  
I don’t see any reason why females shouldn’t be able to become priests  
I think they should all have an equal opportunity  
And  
Um  
I think  
I mean I think you’re still  
You still have a chance at having pedophiles even if they are female  
But  
Again  
You have like a more broad population to chose from  
Like  
Who’s going to become a priest like they’ll be more selective  
So that opens up the pool even more  
 
And  
Um  
So I think that just allowing more people to become priests would just decrease the chance of having a pedophile  
 
Um  
Sure well I am Catholic  
 
But  
Um   
A lot of their  
Whenever I hear about their views on like abortion  
And  
Things like that  
I mean I listen but for me like I follow my own opinions more than I do for the catholic church  
 
Um  
And  
I just I just don’t feel like  
I mean I know I don’t listen to them like as much when I hear like oh don’t do this  
And  
Stem cell research is wrong  
 
And  
All that  
But  
Um  
So  
I mean for me like  
If I was like a staunch catholic I guess I would listen more  
But  
I still think that they’re so behind like  
I don’t know when it comes to like saving lives like with  
Like  
Possibly saving lives with all the research they’re doing  
As opposed to listening to the Catholic Church I think I would choose saving like lives  
 
Um  
Not really
