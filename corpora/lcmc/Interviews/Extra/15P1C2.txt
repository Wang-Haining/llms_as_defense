Not really 
Well 
Yes and no 
And 
This is again something that I feel very strongly about 
But it’s hard to put into words 
Because 
Well 
First of all 
Um 
With the Catholic Church there’s something that few people really know about 
And know about well  
Which is the primacy of conscience 
Which basically states that when you 
If you take 
The 
The teachings of the Catholic Church 
And you  
Think about them you examine them 
And you really feel that that’s not right 
That’s not what your conscience is telling you to do 
Would fit with that 
Then you are obligated to follow your conscience 
Is 
As opposed to 
Like 
What the Church is doing 

And  

Yes it is 

And  
Um  
I feel that 
A lot of 
The Church as people see it  
They only really  
Well there’s 
Um  
A concept that  
We talk about in 
Like 
Justice training called 
Uh 
The loud minority 
Which is not everyone 
Like 
For instance on Loyola’s campus you’ll think that everyone drinks just because there’s a very small number of people who drink 
But they’re very loud and public about the way they do it 

So you see the minority instead of the majority 
And 
I feel like the majority of the people who belong to the Catholic Church aren’t 
Like  
The fundamentalist die-hard  
Um  
Everyone who doesn’t do exactly as the Bible says is going to Hell  
Sort of people 
And 
Like 
Even 
Not just  
Um  
Laypeople but clergy as well  
And  
Um  
I’m not certain if  
Really  
It’s  
Like  
I don’t follow the whole entire structure of the Church 
And 
Like  
Church politics as well as I probably should  
So I’m  
Not really certain how  
Like  
Informed an opinion I could give on 
Whether or not the church itself needs to change doctrine or laws or whatever like that  
But  
I think the really most important thing is not necessarily  
I think it just comes back to the primacy of conscience 

Right 
I feel like that’s sort of a built-in adaptation  
Almost  

For the church  
Like  
I mean  
Certain things will still not be okay  
Like  
If you just 
You know  
Run up and shoot somebody  
Um  
Or  
I think a good example actually is how  
Um  
The view of suicide has changed in the Church  
I’m not really certain that there was ever anything written down about it 
But before it was basically 
If you suicided you could never go to heaven 
But now it’s seen that if 
You commit suicide 
Then there’s obviously been some very huge extenuating circumstances against you 

And so 
Suicide shouldn’t count as the one thing that would keep you from going to heaven 

Um 
I think a lot of it is more fluid than people realize too 
So 
I think the church sort of adapts itself as well  
So  
Um  
Just by 
The people who make up the church 

And so 
I don’t think there’s any need for a huge revolution per se 
I mean 
There’s always going to be people who are unhappy with any sort of institution 
Including the church 

But  

I don’t think so  
I mean  
There’s 
If someone is a pedophile 
Then 
They’re basically going to try and find some way in order to feed that 
Um  
Regardless of 
Even if there were females priests allowed 
There would still be the priests who were pedophiles 
Who would still  
Like  
See that as their  
Sort of  
Um  
Way  
I suppose  
To get to what they want  
And  
It wouldn’t stop them from still becoming priests 

Or 
Like 
It’s the same thing with saying 
Um  
You know  
If there were only male teachers 
And then would allowing female teachers 
Or something like that 
It’s 
Adding something else to it wouldn’t change what’s already there 

Mm 
I don’t know  
I mean  
I think that  
I definitely admit that 
Um  
Pedophilia 
Like  
In the priesthood is 
You know  
It’s not good at all  
I’m not  
Like  
Condoning it or whatever 
But I really think that it’s blown up just because people are  
To a certain point 
People are trying to blame things  
They’re trying to associate things that don’t really have any cause in order to 
Start a change that they want to see  

Like  
If  
Um  
If enough people say that  
Oh  
If there were female priests then there wouldn’t have  
This wouldn’t have happened 
Well really 
All they really care about is just getting female priests 
Instead of 
Um 
The issue of 
Like 
Stopping pedophilia in the church 

Right 

No that’s it
