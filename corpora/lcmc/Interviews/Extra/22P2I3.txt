It would seem that we’ve been at war for a very long time 
Um 
I’m not quite sure the motivations that we got involved in the war for 
And 
I don’t think we’re achieving the goals that we were setting out to do to achieve when we started the war 
I feel that we are 
Um 
Putting a lot of resources in the form of money 
And 
Uh 
American lives towards fighting a war that might not be ours to battle 
I don’t think that it is 
Uh 
America’s greater responsibility to 
Uh 
Promote some sort of world peace by fighting 

I think that you know the US Army 
Uh 
Is spending money trying to fight a war that is 
Um 
Unjust 
I feel that it is unfair that Americans are dying 
You know 
Young people are dying in that war 

I think it’s gone on long enough 

We’ve been fighting for several years now 
And 
We have not 
I have not 
Uh 
Been informed 
Or 
It has not been made clear to me what objectives we have succeeded in 
So far the headlines are just in the form of who’s dying 
And 
I’m not hearing that we are gaining any you know strong advantage over there 

No
