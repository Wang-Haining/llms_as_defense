Ok um
Yes I think it does
Um
I think it should definitely 
Um
You know 
Continue to make changes
As toward whether the society is like for that day
And not just live
Um
How 
You know
When it originated 2000 years ago
Um
Yeah societies are always changing
Cultures are always changing 
And there’s no way to really stop that 
And the Catholic Church must keep up with that
In order to fulfill their duties 
To the people at that time
Um
I think 
You know 
The main general principle should still stay the same as their foundation when it was founded
But
They should definitely be able to adjust around the current day
With 
Um 
The situations that are presented now a days
That weren’t around back 2000 years ago
Um
Just with 
You know
How much society changes
Within 100 years is big enough
Let alone 2000 years ago when the church was started 
And
I know they have definitely made steps toward 
And some strides since then
They’ve been
They’ve been fairly
Um
Adaptive
Um
And I think they should definitely keep doing that 
Maybe a little bit more even 
So

Uh
Sure
Um
You know 
With
As far as
Let me think of this as a few certain issues
Um
Well
You know
The basic principles will still be there
Now 
They should
Yeah 
Not necessarily change their viewpoint 
But maybe give the people better perspective on current issues
I don’t like
Um
I’m trying to think of some
Um
Huh
Alright with 
You know
I think they’re right on with the abortion issue 
They shouldn’t change that at all that goes back to one of their 
Standard points
One of their basic principles 
To preserve life and love and everything
It’s not that they should change that
They should continue
You know
To be outspoken about it
And continue to preach what they think is right about that
Um
Now with you know topics such as
War
You know
Same type of thing 
Their in
They want to preserve life
Take it sacred
Um 
Keep it sacred
And um
Shouldn’t necessarily change their viewpoints at all
But 
You know 
Actually continue to 
Um
Be outspoken about that as well
And I guess you know
Some smaller issues
Maybe they should get more involved with um
Such as 
This is probably
This is
This is
This is an example
You know
With the technology changing now a days
They should also adapt to 
A little bit more science
They’re very anti-scientific
I guess
I guess you could say

So maybe they should keep trying to adapt a little bit with science that’s changing as well as technology 
And not change their viewpoints
But just be a little bit more mindful about
Um
The technology now a day
The science now a day 
I think that would help them stay 
You know
Stay at the same pace with the citizens of this day

Uh
Well
As far as um
You know
Certain technology 
That’s around now that wasn’t available back then
That they kind of talk down against
Is maybe 
The whole stem cell research thing

Because you know that wasn’t even a question back then to
You know it wasn’t spoken about in the Bible 
Or early church teachings 
But now a day you have to look at 
Um 
Maybe if this could save lives 
You know
Without costing any other lives
Without using 
You know
Aborted stem cells
But maybe look into some research 
Involving stem cells in a good way
And maybe that could help people in the future 
With some sickness and stuff
So

So yeah 
They should just always be mindful of 
You know
Advances in technology and science 
Um
They get 
They should work with them
Instead of kind of
I don’t know 
Being separated from them
As they sometimes are

Yeah
Yeah that’s a good topic too
I didn’t even get into that
I don’t know why
But yeah
Um
Well avoided I don’t know
But um
Because I don’t think
I wouldn’t necessarily say it would be avoided 
Because it wasn’t
You know
Even though it was a huge scandal
If you look at if with a
Smaller percentage of them
Then normal people
So it’s not
You know the numbers are going to be there 
It’s just that a select few a very small amount can’t ruin it for everyone else
But you know
I think that maybe jus the amount of 
Less priest
Less men becoming priest now a days is hurting the church a little bit
So maybe they should adapt to 
Maybe allowing women to be priests
Or um
Yeah
I’m not to sure about the marriage thing
Because there’s a very big issue about dedicating one’s life to God and the church
And that’s kind of
You know
You have many more responsibilities if you’re married
That you might not be able to handle that
But I think that definitely the women priest
I think
I think that’s definitely a possibility 
I don’t see why that wouldn’t be 
Um
Made available 

Um
No not really 
I mean yeah they should just make sure that they stay current
I think it would help them as well as 
Um
You know Catholics as well
So
