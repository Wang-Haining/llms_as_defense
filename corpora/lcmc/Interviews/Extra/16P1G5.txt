Um 
I am personally for gay marriage 
I really don’t see a problem with 
Uh 
Gay people wanting to unionize their relationship with marriage 
Um 
I understand some people seek a 
Uh 
Moral dilemma with their religion 
But 
Uh 
An example with the catholic church 
The catholic church does not have to recognize any marriage they do not want to 
So 
If it’s recognized by the state it doesn’t mean it has to be recognized by the church 
So 
I really don’t see a problem 

Um 
I feel like the federal government should not be involved in this issue only 
Because 
It really has nothing to do with the government 
It has to do with people wanting to just make their relationship pretty much an official thing under the law 
So 
I don’t understand why men can marry men or women can’t marry women 
‘Cause 
It’s just a union of a relationship 
I don’t see a problem 

Um 
I feel like gay men or gay women should be able to get married 
I don’t really care if they do or they don’t 
But 
I feel like it’s their right 
And 
If men and women can do it then they should be able to do it too 

No
