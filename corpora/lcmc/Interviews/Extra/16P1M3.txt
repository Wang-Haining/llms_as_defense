Um 
I am not myself a marijuana user 
But 
I don’t really believe that it should be illegal 

Because 
It does serve good purposes 
And 
It really affects just as much if not less than what 
Uh 
Alcohol affects 
And 
Alcohol is legal 
So 

Um 
I just don’t really enjoy smoking at any point 
So 
I don’t really like marijuana 
But 
I don’t mind if anybody else uses it 

Uh 
What was that 

Yes I do 

Um 
I don’t know I feel like they both are mind altering drugs 
And 
They both affect 
Pretty much affect your decision making process 
And 
The effects really aren’t that much different 
In fact they’re pretty much almost the same 
They of course target different parts of the brain 
But 
In the end it’s pretty much the same thing 

If they just made the same kind of laws they made for 
Uh 
Marijuana as they already have for alcohol I think it would be the same 

Nope
