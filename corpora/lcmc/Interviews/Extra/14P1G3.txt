Ok
Um
Yeah I know it’s probably 
It’s 
Still in very few states have legalize it correct
I’m not really sure the number 
But

I know a lot of them are working towards it
But I grew up catholic 
And learned 
That you know
Marriage is something
It’s
You know
Marriage is men
Male and female
What they’re arguing I guess
Is just for
You know 
Benefits
Then just to have a couple
Um
You know the whole marriage thing
It’s 
I can see it more as a partnership 
You know 
Just to have that
That’s fine with me
You know
If they love each other
If they want to 
You know
Live together
And 
I think they should probably
They should be able to fulfill every other 
Um
Benefit that
Couples do
I just kind of agree
Disagree with the whole marriage think
Just because 
As I learned marriage was more of just
You know
A bond
That continues to grow the family 
With having the kids
And between the male and female

So I think that
It should 
It shouldn’t be
It shouldn’t be illegal
For uh
You know
Two men are two females
To live together
To receive 
Um
The benefits of having each other through 
You know
If it’s having a dependent
Or 
Or whatever
I think that should be fine
Um
And it’s kind of tough too 
Because then you have the cross over between church and state
Um
It’s always a sticky issue

And
I don’t know
With this country 
It’ just seems a lot of people are pushing away from that
And
Um
I think you do have to separate the two
A little bit
In that type of situation

From 
I mean a lot of people in the country are pushing away from
Um 
You know
Having the church and state being associated with each other

A lot of them are pushing towards 
You know it’s two separate
You know
A lot of stuff I don’t agree with
With the whole 
You know no God
No prayers
And no God
And no this and that
But in a certain situation you just have to look at the individuals and 
If they want to live together their going to 
And you can’t just 
You know
You can’t call it illegal 
You’ve got to look at them as a couple like anyone else
But
Um
Yeah
Just as far as the whole marriage thing 
I don’t think 
I don’t think it’s quite the same
So 

Yeah
Uh
I don’t think 
I don’t really agree with it
With you know
If the federal government is involved with anything 
They should probably go the other way
Because
It just goes back to what I was saying
Um
You can’t really
I don’t know how you can really have a ban 
On what people think
What they want 
As long as they aren’t invading anyone else privacy 
It’s on their own 
And
I mean
I mean I just think they deserve the rights of everyone else
For having
For being a couple
So

Uh
Yeah 
Not 
I mean just going back to the situation as I see marriage 
I just see marriage as a union between male and female 
Um
To 
Uh
You know to continue a family 
So that’s the way I see marriage
I don’t 
I really don’t think that can be associated between male and male or female and female
But 
You know
I do think that there could be something else there
There could be you know a partnership between them
And 
I know they’re calling it marriage and everything 
But I think it’s a little different 
But 
I think that should be allowed if anything
So

You know
I just think marriage is something more 
Um
First of all it’s
You know
I think marriage is a bond between them to 
Not only love each other forever 
But to strive to have a family
You know raise kids
To 
You know
Like that
And for theirs
Theirs is more just about being together
I guess
I mean 
I guess they could adopt kids 
So that’s another issue
So yeah 
I just grew up learning that marriage was something else
Just between the male and the female 
So 

That’s probably it
