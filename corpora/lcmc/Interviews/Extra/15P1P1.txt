No 
I don’t believe that it’s an invasion of privacy 
The entire 
Object of the internet is the free movement of information across different 
Like  
Distances 

And so it’s  
Really 
If you post something on a public website such as MySpace or Facebook 
Then the chances are someone is going to see it 
Unless you make it private 

And 
It’s not an invasion of privacy at all 
It’s just the same thing as 
Like 
Using information found on a Wikipedia article 
Or something like that 

I think that 
Basically 
If you stick something on the internet 
Like 
In any sort of 
Um 
Public thing 
Like a Live Journal or Myspace account then 
You’re completely putting it out there for everyone 
Including 
Uh  
You know 
The 
School officials 
Or even government or anyone can see it 
And 
That’s sort of the point of the entire thing 

It’s not really 
Like 
They’re 
Being unfair or something 
They’re 
Like  
The really only invasion of privacy would be if 
For instance 
You had a locked file on your computer 
And they basically hacked into your computer without your knowledge 
Or if they confiscated your hard drive for a search 
Or something along those lines 

But if you just stick something on the internet 
No  
It’s completely public 

Or 
What I meant was more that 
Um 
When you put something on MySpace or on Live Journal or on Facebook 
Basically it will be up there for anyone to see 
If you don’t put any sort of privacy filters on it 
Then it’s just the same thing as submitting 
Um  
An article to the Wikipedia 
Which is 

You know 
Like 
Another 
Um 
User-based 
Um 
Website 

And 
It’s just 
The entire point of the internet is 
Like  
To get things out there 
And  
Saying that 
Oh 
Well 
I only meant for these people to see it 
When you didn’t really ensure that only those people would see it 
Is just  
Sort of  
Stupidity on your own part 

Or 
No 
That would be invading privacy 

Um 
I’m not really certain just because 
This is Loyola 
And it’s not exactly something that I would spend a lot of time thinking about 
Because personally I don’t have 
Like 
Plans to 
Um  
Anything 
Any sort of sensitive material 
Like  
Kept on my hard drive 
Or something 
That I would be offended if someone saw it 
Or  
Like 
If there was a search of my computer 

And so 
Mmm 
I don’t know 
Privacy 
The internet is one thing that I do feel strongly about 
That it’s public if you put something out there 
And it’s public 
Then you shouldn’t be 
You know 
Surprised if a 
An official finds it and uses it against you 

But personal computers and things like that 
It’s like 
A lot of people use it as 
A diary almost 
And so if you’re writing something just on your computer 
Not sharing it with anyone 
And then they confiscate your hard drive 
It sort of 
The same lines along 
Or  
Along the same lines as when a search of your residence hall apartment is 
Um 
An invasion of your privacy 
Or if they have sufficient cause 

Well 
Basically  
For the internet 
If you put something out there 
Then don’t be surprised if people see it 
Which is the point 
Of the internet
