Well I definitely agree with that  
I think it’s still present  
Um  
Especially in the workplace  
Because  
Um  
While it’s changed since like the 1940’s  
And  
Everything  
Like women are now accepted to be working  
But  
I still think in some high end professions they’re still discriminated against  
Such as like being a CEO  
And  
Um  
Being like a top surgeon  
And  
Everything  
I think men still prevail  
 
Um  
Also  
I think  
Also like I just recently heard about like the Harvard  
Um  
President saying how like women aren’t as good in science and math  
Like so that’s still that concept still like resides in our society  
 
That women still should stay home  
And  
Have just children  
And  
Be the homemaker  
And  
Um  
Even in pol  
Especially in politics too  
We still haven’t had like a female president  
And  
Whenever like I say anything like of that sort to like a male friend or anything he’ll just brush it off and be like oh we can’t have a female president that’s just wrong we’ve always had a male president  
 
And  
Um  
So I definitely agree that they’re  
That women are still discriminated against  
And  
Also  
You hear about how women  
Um  
Still get paid less than men in the same job  
 
And  
Um  
Then  
Um  
I happen  
I was looking through this book  
And  
Um  
They were talking about like  
Um  
It was like a  
To help women get good jobs  
And  
Everything  
 
And  
They’re trying to give like tips  
And  
Things like that  
And  
One of them was  
Um  
When you’re in the office be professional  
And  
Don’t show emotion  
And  
Um  
Don’t decorate your office or something like that they said  
 
Yeah  
And  
Uh  
To me it just sounded like act more like a man  
 
In order to move up in your workplace  
That’s what it just said to me  
 
Um  
It’s hard to do  
‘Cause  
You have to pretty much change people’s opinions  
Which is hard to do  
 
But  
Um  
I just think  
I think with time it will be solved  
Because  
Like  
When you compare it from 1940 to now I think we’re definitely in a better place as women  
Um  
I think also like women shouldn’t be  
Um  
Discouraged by this concept of being weaker  
Um  
So like if we ever do get like a female president  
And  
I think that just by showing by example like it will change what society thinks about women  
 
And  
Uh  
It’s hard to do to change other people’s opinions  
But  
I think by not being discouraged I think women can move ahead  
 
I think they are  
Um  
In  
Um  
Professions that women really  
Um  
Prevail in  
Such as nursing I think  
Um  
I think men that  
Um  
If they’re a nurse I think they get more like by other men I think they get laughed at sometimes  
Like  
There’s always that stigma about a male nurse it’s like oh that’s not supposed to be  
 
So I think in professions such as that I think they’re discriminated against  
 
Um  
Other  
I guess  
Uh  
I guess male  
I don’t know about male teachers  
Um  
But  
Like male grade school teachers  
Like usually that was like a woman thing to do  
Be a grade school teacher  
Um  
I think maybe if there’s a male maybe they could be looked upon by like questionably  
Like why do you want to spend time with children or things like that  
 
I think that could also be a factor  
But  
Nursing was the first thing that came to my mind  
 
Um  
I think  
Well I think first of all they would be like  
Let’s say you’re in a hospital I think the doctors would look at the male nurses as why aren’t you a doctor  
 
I think they would kind of look down on them for even though nursing is a good profession  
I think they would still be looked down upon  
 
And  
Maybe by other female nurses they would be alienated a little  
Like this is where women prevail  
And  
Why are you here  
 
Um  
And  
Maybe by their friends also I think  
If you say you’re a male nurse  
There was a movie that made fun of like this man was a male nurse and they made fun of him the whole movie  
 
So  
 
Um  
No not much more
