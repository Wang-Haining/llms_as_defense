GENDER
Um 
Should I start now? 
Ok 
Um 
Well I don’t really see it as that big an issue right now just because it seems like women are on the rise right now with gaining jobs 
And um 
Education 
Like if you look at colleges now 
They’re usually 
The female population usually outnumbers the male population 
So that probably means that in time 
Like over the next ten years I would guess 
A lot of 
Um 
Desirable jobs will be going to women instead of men because they’ll probably be more qualified women than men coming out of college 
Um 
Another thing if you look at 
Um 
I mean Hilary Clinton is a good example of where uh 
Where gender discrimination isn’t really playing a role 
She’s most likely going to win the Democratic 
Um vote 
And be able to run for President 
Probably I would think she would win in two years 
And um 
I don’t know 
It seems like a lot of women are becoming more in charge 
Even like Nancy Polosi is speaker of the house right now 
Um  
I don’t know like you could also look at the CEO’s of like Fortune 500 companies that are probably mostly men right now, but there are women in charge of 
Like I know a woman is in charge of Ebay 
Is like either the CEO or the head person of EBay 
Um 
I don’t know 
It just seems like it’s on the rise 
There probably is still some gender discrimination just based on how companies are run right now 
With men at the top or in uh more executive roles 
Who would probably give preference to men than women 
Um I don’t know 
Like that’s not right 
Like I think that should be 
That’ll probably eventually be phased out with this women 
More women coming out of college 
Um 
I don’t know 
Um 
Well I guess 
I don’t know if you could really do anything like 
You can’t really do like an affirmative action kinda thing where like a certain amount of women have to work in certain positions 
But like as long as people start realizing that women are just as qualified as men I think they’ll probably level out the playing field a little bit and give 
Not give preference to one gender over another 
Um 
I don’t know if there’s some kind of action that’s being taken now to like 
To help gender discrimination 
But I don’t know 
It seems like it’ll just work itself out over time 
Um 
Well certain jobs I guess that some men might want are 
The only thing I could think of is like the fashion business or something 
Like it seems like mostly women 
But I don’t how many men are trying to get into fashion 
But there are 
There are some 
I don’t know 
But it seems like mostly women 
But I don’t think if they’re really discriminating against 
So 
Um 
I don’t know 
I’ve never had that 
I’ve never encountered any gender discrimination against men so I don’t really know 
I don’t know anybody who has 
I don’t know 
Um 
Well like I said with the college 
I don’t know 
It just seems like women are on the rise 
Like it 
Discrimination against women has been worse 
Um 
Earlier in the century 
Obviously like they 
Once they fought for um voting rights 
And kinda said like we’re the same as men 
Um 
It seems to have been changing since then 
And a lot more women are getting good jobs 
I don’t know 
It just seems like it’s being phased out 
Um 
Hopefully soon it will be completely 
Just so it’s a more equal playing field 
And it’ll probably be rewarding for a man to win a high position because he’s not just in competition with other men 
He’ll be in competition with everyone 
Um 
I don’t know that’s it 
Um 
Not really
