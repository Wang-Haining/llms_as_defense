GAY MARRIAGE
Um 
Yeah I think people who oppose it are 
Are the wrong side 
Um 
I don’t really see what the issue is 
I just feel like American 
If you’re a U.S. citizen you should have every right 
If everyone 
If our foundations are built on equality it just seems like that’s very biased and against uh gays 
But it just seems like people have this idea of gay people that just doesn’t 
They don’t feel like it’s right to allow it 
But I mean right now it exists so you might as well just face it and allow them to have the same rights as any man and woman who want to get married 
Um 
I know some people argue against um marriage taxes and that kind of stuff 
But 
Or like cheating the system by 
Like there was even that movie about the two guys getting married to uh 
Just raise more money or something 
I don’t know what 
But um 
I mean that’ll probably go on 
But I mean that could go on with men and women too if two mutual friends or platonic friends just want to get married to have marriage rights 
I mean it could still go on 
And um 
The other 
I know the other argument is against um 
The sanctity of marriage which kind of seems ridiculous at this point when over fifty percent of marriages are ending in divorce nowadays 
Um 
It just doesn’t seem like as holy a union as it used to be or 
I don’t know 
It just seems like that is not a good argument against allowing more people to be married 
Um 
Yeah 
Um 
Well I don’t 
I don’t know if it’s written right now in the constitution uh something against that 
But I guess there is since it’s not allowed in most states 
But um 
I feel like President Bush is just pushing for that 
He might feel that way too 
But I feel like he’s just pushing for that to gain votes from the more Fundamentalist Christian right-winged people in the country 
Um 
Who are very against gay marriage 
But that’ll probably never get passed realistically just cause 
I don’t know 
It just doesn’t seem right I guess to most people 
Um 
Yeah 
Um yeah 
Well yeah I just feel like it should be equal for anyone as long as you’re a citizen you should have the right to get married by the state 
Um 
And have them recognize it as a 
Like they do talk about 
Um 
About allowing them to get married but not calling it an actually marriage 
The same as men and women 
But 
I 
That still doesn’t seem to right 
But I guess if that were to 
If they were to implement that first it seems like a big step toward allowing it 
So that would be good I guess 
Um 
No
