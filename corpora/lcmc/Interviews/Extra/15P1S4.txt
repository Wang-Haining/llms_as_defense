I think that it really is an issue 
Um 
Although 
Really the only thing that can be done to change it is changing people’s minds 
Just like with any other issue that has to do with social justice or things like that 
And when someone is dead set on something 
It’s really hard to do so 
Like 
If someone is a militant misogynist 
There’s really no amount of conversation that you can have with them that will 
Change their minds just from 
Um 
In 
Informal discussion 
Things like that 

Basically the only way to make change is if someone is really open to it 
And 
Part of that 
Well 
I’m not really sure what can be done because 
As much as possible in schools 
And in 
Um  
Like 
The media and things like that 
I’ve seen a lot of change 
So that there’s almost no 
Like 
Gender roles 
That are specifically assigned to be more 
Like 
You don’t see the 
Uh 
Leave it to Beaver sort of set-up always in sitcoms anymore 

And 
Just 
Um  
Things like that 
It’s becoming 
Gender equality is becoming more of 
A 
A standard 
I suppose 
In our culture 
But there’s still a lot of way 
There’s a huge way to go 
In the way that most people think 
Like 
There’s 
Um 
Like the brainteaser about the kid in a car accident with his father 
And then the doctor says 
Oh 
I can’t operate on this son 
Or 
On this child 
Because he’s my son 

You don’t 
Like 
It still works because people will still not automatically assume 
It’s like 
Oh 
It’s the mother 
Like 
It’s not that obvious to some people 

Um 

Well 
It’s just from what I’ve seen 
Like 
In 
For instance 
There’s 
This one 
Um 
Sitcom 
That I think has 
Fran Drescher in it now 

And she’s 
Like 
Living with her boyfriend 
And 
It’s 
You know 
She’s not 
Like 
The stereotypical 
Like 
Married stay-at-home mom in this 
You know 
It’s 
There’s a lot more 
Um 
Gender role models 
I guess 
For 
Like 
Empowered women 
In the media 
And 
You know 
Not necessarily that just living with your boyfriend is \
Like 
Empowered 
Or whatever 
But it’s a huge step forward when 
Even like 
When I Dream of Jeannie was running and they couldn’t even show bellybuttons on the air 

Oh 
Definitely 

I mean 
There’s 
Even the issue about sexual harassment 
If you hear that some sort of sexual harassment is going on 
Then you will automatically assume 
Oh 
It’s a guy against a woman 
Not that ever it’s against a guy 
And that’s why there’s always the statistics that show it happens more often to women just because guys won’t report it 
Or 
Don’t think that it’s possible 
I suppose 
For it to happen to them 

I think that a lot of it is just more education 
Because if you’re shown 
Like 
When you’re a child that 
Okay 
There’s not necessarily one specific thing that my gender is supposed to fulfill 
Or that 
This sort of thing will always happen only to my gender 
Then it’s a lot easier to be open-minded 
When you have that sort of freedom that’s taught to you from the very beginning 

Not particularly
