No I don’t 

Well Myspace is a public site 
And 
Anyone can go on it 
And 
If somebody says something on there that could hurt other people then 
It could be used against them to stop them 

Um 
I don’t know 
I guess it’s like the same thing with like Facebook now 
Like 
If you write like threats 
Threaten somebody you can use that threat 
Whether it’s a joke or not to like 
Deter somebody from doing it 
I don’t know 
It’s like proof that they will do it 

I mean with Facebook nobody whose not your friend can see your profile 
But 
With Myspace unless you put yours on private anybody can see it 
So 
If you put your stuff on there it’s public knowledge 

Um 
I guess illegal searches of 
Uh 
Like your own private stuff 
I mean that’s not really private it’s over the internet 
And 
The internet’s free so 
It’s public 

Um 
I don’t know 
I guess 
The internet’s just like 
It’s free to anybody to use 
It’s 
You can use it whether you 
I mean anybody can use it 
I don’t know 
So 
If you want to put something on there you have to expect that somebody will see it 

No
