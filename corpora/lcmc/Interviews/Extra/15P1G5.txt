I think that 
This issue has a lot of things attached to it 
For instance 
There’s 
When a lot of people hear gay marriage they automatically assume that that includes civil unions
And  
Also  
Like  
Being married in the eyes of both church and state 
And 
While some people are opposed to both 
There’s a lot who are just 
Their entire argument is based on 
Oh 
Well 
I don’t want 
This 
Like 
Oh  
It’s outlawed in the Bible 
So they can’t be wed 
I don’t want them to be 
Um  
Uh 
Like  
Desecrating the sacrament basically 

And 
Then they automatically assume that it’s just as wrong to be granted the same rights 
That you’d be 
If you were 
Like 
A married man and woman 
But  
Just  
Like 
By a justice of the peace 
Not by 
Like 
A priest 

Um 
It’s completely possible for someone to be against gay marriage 
When it’s 
Like 
Married by the church 
And 
Still be for 
Like 
Gay civil unions 
And  
I think that a lot of people just completely overlook the fact because  
The two are just so connected 
In 
The 
Common mind 
It’s just that 
Um  
People don’t really see that there’s a middle road that can be taken 
Like 
Yes  
I completely think that it would be amazing 
You know 
If there were completely equal rights both in 
Religiously speaking 
And 
Um 
Just 
Civilly speaking 
For gay couples  
But 
There are half-steps that can be taken 
And   
That   
I think  
Wouldn’t really offend as many people as just completely legalizing and condoning from the church 
Um  
Both marriage and civil unions at the same time 

Well 
A lot of people will be opposed to both 
Until the day that they die 
But 
Even 
Just in the past few years 
Um  
Discrimination in general against the gay community has been decreasing for the most part 
Like  
Even just looking on Loyola’s campus 
It’s easy to see 
Like 
You hear 
Um 
From the denim day lectures and stuff 
People who were here years ago and they said how 
Basically 
It was impossible to live here 
But now it’s  
There’s more discussion going on 
And 
If people were more open to discussion  
About the different options  
For instance 
Just 
Like 
Civil unions instead of 
Like  
Church marriages and things like that 
Like   
The sacrament of marriage 
Um  
Then I think that more strides could be taken 
Like  
More gradual change would be easier for people to cope with 
Instead of complete upheaval of something 

Well 
I absolutely hate President Bush  

And this is just  

Well 
This is just another one of the reasons 
Where 
It’s  
Discrimination is what he would be putting into the constitution 
And  
While 
I don’t see how that can even be remotely possible 
When 
You know 
The First Amendment right of free speech and 
Just 
The constitution is supposed to be something that protects the freedoms of the people 
Not limiting  
What and what 
What someone can and cannot do with their life 

And I feel that is completely wrong 

Um 
I feel like 
It’s 
Also 
Bringing into  
It’s completely destroying the separation between church and state 
It’s fine that if  
You  
Well  
Not fine  
But I can understand it if that 
You are opposed to homosexuality because of religious reasons 
But it’s not fine to  
Have that 
Go into your job when your job includes affecting the lives of the 
Numerous people that live in the United States 

Um 
Well 
I think that it’s great for someone to have 
A sort of  
Religious or spiritual connection 
And that 
It’s fine to be public about this too 
But it’s 
The separation between church and state came into effect because 
Not everyone is the same religion 
And 
Religious freedom is one of the things that the United States is supposed to stand for 
And that’s why everyone gets so outraged 
When there’s something about 
Like 
If you’re not this certain religion in this other country then you get shot 
And 
Oh 
We must go stop this 
And that’s why everyone supports that 
Because 
We’re so accustomed to these freedoms and we love them 
But 
When 
By the same token 
You’re using 
A sort of 
Religion as an excuse 
To push your own personal agenda  
Or  
Anything like that 
Then it’s completely wrong 

Not really
