Um 
I would say no 
I think they already have 
I think the Catholic Church is 
The Vatican too its caught up 
It caught up a lot back in the 70’s with with a lot of the things that they were missing and I think pretty much as the years have gone by and as diff 
As different Popes have I guess controlled the church they’ve kind of modernized the Church a little bit more 
I think some of the 
Some of the strong opinions that the Church has are are just moral as opposed to just being 
Um 
Like in modern 
I 
I 
I think that the Church doesn’t need to really modernize their views 
I think what the Church is trying to do is keep people believing in strong values and morals as opposed to 
I mean if you wanna 
I guess that a lot of people might say that the Church isn’t really modern because they oppose some things or they believe in certain things that they say you’re not allowed to do 

But I don’t think that makes them not modern I think it just makes them very traditional and 
And holding to very strict morals which is what any religion strives to do 

Um 
I definitely think that it might 
It might have been prevented if if they church had allowed priests to marry 
I don’t think 
I think the church is moving towards allowing priests to marry so 
Um 
I don’t know 
I don’t know how many more cases will 
Will result 
But I mean I’m sure even people who aren’t priests 
There’s probably more of a population who 
Who are pedophiles then who are pedophiles and priests 
And I think just because they are priests it’s gained such a strong 
Such a strong media coverage that people just associated pedophiles with priests now 

And I don’t know if maybe it would have 
It probably would have been prevented if a small majority but I mean if those people are pedophiles then they obviously aren’t really interested in getting married either 
I mean maybe if they were married they would still do the same exact thing so 

I don’t think allowing female priests or allowing priests to get married would really change that 
I think it just has to do with with I guess monitoring the actions of priests 

Better 
I don’t know 

Um 
I don’t think there’s really 
I think its just to monitor priests better and maybe just to to be open to 
Not so much allowing priests to marry or allowing females priests for the simple 
Like for the lone fact of trying to prevent pedophilia but maybe just because 
I mean there’s such a small majority of priests now that its eventually gonna have to happen because there’s not gonna be any more priests left 

Um 
So I think maybe that’s one way that the church could move in a different direction then where they’re at right now 
Um 
But I don’t really have any other any other views on the whole priests pedophile thing 

Um 
Not really
