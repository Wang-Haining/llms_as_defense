OK um 
How I feel right now about it is 
You know 
We’re not in there for a good reason  
And 
We should get out while we can 
Although 
This is something difficult  
Because 
We have to finish what we started 
We can’t just leave the place a mess over there 
Um 
As far as when the war started 
You know 
Myself 
And 
I feel a lot of different Americans had a very different feeling then as they do now  Because 
You know  
That was fairly close to nine eleven 
And 
People have that whole feeling against terrorism 
Um 
And 
It seems like we might not have been able to 
We might not have gone to the right place 
Or 
We shouldn’t have started something we couldn’t finish 

Um 
It seems like its 
With terrorism kind of separated from the actual country its creating a big mess over there 
Because 
We are fighting terrorism 
Its not all in this one spot 
And 
This spot 
You know 
Iraq where we’re fighting at  
There’s a lot more there than just the terrorists 
Um 
And 
There’s a lot of questions about 
You know 
Maybe we went there just because of the whole oil thing 
There’s just a lot of 
Lot of conspiracies out there 
And 
Just seems like it wasn’t the right place to go 

Um 
You know 
There’s lives lost every day now  
And 
It just seems that it’s dragging out for no reason 
It seems that it’s something that we can never finish 
Um 
Now I know 
You know 
It might look bad for President Bush to pull these pe 
Pull us out of the war this late in the game 
But 
I think it would save a lot of lives though 
I don’t think it would be a bad thing to do 
 
Um 
And 
As far as 
You know 
Terrorism there’s how to fight that 
I don’t know if you ever can really ever stop that 
Because 
If you kill one leader ten other leaders come out of nowhere 
And 
They just keep growing 
So 
There’s so many different areas between North Korea 
And 
The Middle East 
And 
You know 
All over to really ever get rid of it 
Um 
I don’t know 
And 
You know 
Going overseas to fight 
I think there’s a lot of stuff to take care of your own country 

So 
It’s kind of like 
This war has cost us so much money 
I think two billion dollars 
Around there 
Actually it might even be a lot more 
I forgot what the number is 
But 
It’s a ridiculous amount 
It’s a ridiculous number 
And 
We could really help our own country with that kind of money 
So 

Yeah 
I mean 
Um 
You know 
Take care of the education systems in our country 
Which 
In the inner cities are kind of lacking right now 
Um 
Just the fact that there’s many many homeless people out there 
Um 
That could use our help to 
You know 
Start 
Um 
Start a fresh life with a little extra money 
Or 
Whatever 
There’s tons of programs that could be created to help them with this money 
Or 
Its just kind of 
When you spend that much money into the war 
And 
You don’t really see some amazing effects out of it 
It makes you wonder what they could have been doing to help our country 
So 

Well yeah it seems like the progress isn’t there anymore 
You know 
When we first went in we were seeing a lot of progress as it had just started 
But 
Now it just seems almost impossible 
Um 
We don’t really have the backing that we used to have from the rest of the world right now 
And 
It seems like it’s not a war that we can finish on our own 
And 
It’s on someone else’s turf 
And 
Um 
Like I said 
It seems like the more you take out if you do the more terrorism you take out it seems like 
You know 
Ten times that just pops up the next day 
So 
I’m not sure how you can just always 
You just gotta 
I’m not sure 
I think you should be watching your own country first I guess is what I should say 

Um 
I think that’s about it
