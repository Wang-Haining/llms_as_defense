Um 
I 
Agree with the legalization of marijuana 
I think that 
Statistics even show that 
Um 
Alcohol is a much more deadlier drug then 
Um 
Then marijuana is 
Um 
Even smoking 
Cigarettes 
Which is 
Um 
You know a recreational thing people do all the time can even has just as many 
Um 
Causes of lung cancer from it 
I don’t see why 
I don’t see how like 
That has been anymore beneficial to people‘s lives then marijuana has 
Which is illegal 
Um 
(pause) 
I 
I mean I think that they have to make certain rules and laws like about 
Um 
Like marijuana usage 
like I think that if they were really going to have it legalized throughout the United States they should have kind of companies making it 

Like um 
Like how companies make alcohol or companies make cigarette brands 
Like have a company that makes marijuana where they sell it at certain places 
To make it more of 
To not make it such like a bad thing 
You know 
Um 

Um 
What part 
The bad thing 

Oh 
Um 
Cause if its 
If its shown that like 
People 
Like higher people are making it and that like 
Its ok that its being sold like to a certain age group 
Yes 
But like that its 
Um 
Being sold and that the government is 
Is behind it 
Is aiding it 
Um 
I think that it won’t 
That marijuana won’t look as 
Such as 
Won’t look so much as like a 
Um 
Just as a bad thing like 
Like a harmful drug that 
Um 
It’ll just give it a better reputation I guess 

Um 
Yes 
Um 
I mean a lot more people have 
Had alcohol poisoning then 
I mean marijuana overdose 
Like I don’t think that there are any 
Real statistics on that like 
People die everyday from alcohol poisoning and 
Um 
Like alcohol as not been 
Um 
Well it has been prohibited but that was a while ago and 
Um 
Even like drunk driving cases 
There has been 
There has also been thousands of drunk drivers that have 
Um 
Hurt and killed people 
You know everyday as well and 
I think that 
Um 
Marijuana 
The 
Just the effects of it and how it effects other people not just the person 
Um 
Using the drug 
It effects it a 
Them a lot less harmfully then alcohol does 

Um 
No
