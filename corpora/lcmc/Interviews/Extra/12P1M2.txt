Um 
Uh 
I don’t 
I don’t know if I have any feeling 
Um 
I think that 
That I guess marijuana use is something that is personalized and not really 
I don’t know 
Maybe not 
I mean I know it is a strong 
Its probably one of the most popular drugs used but I don’t think it 
I mean I know 
I know Canada has laws on that and 
I don’t know how it would really effect our society if if we if we legalized it for people of any age not just over 21 
Um 
I don’t know if they’re necessarily doing the wrong thing 
I think it probably just 
Maybe it’ll just cut down more on 
Um 
I guess having to arrest people 
Cause I don’t know 
I know a lot of those skier types and snowboarders are uh 
Are users of various substances 
So I don’t know 
I mean I think 
I think in Denver there’s probably just a lot of marijuana usage and they figure if everyone’s really doing it we can’t really arrest everyone 

So 
I guess why not legalize it in some way 

Um 
Personally I don’t use it 
I never have 
So I really 
I don’t know 
I think 
I don’t think I really care 
I mean if I could walk into a store and people were selling it there like legal 
Um 
I don’t think I’d care as long as it wasn’t I guess being distributed to younger kids 

Um 
I don’t really know what the effects are 
I mean I’ve 
I’ve been around people who have used marijuana and people who have drank alcohol 
Um 
I think 
I think more harmful actions come from the use of alcohol then from marijuana 
I think just from the use of marijuana just a lot less things can get done 
I guess it makes you more 
I guess tame or 
I guess not wanting to really do anything and I know with alcohol it impairs a lot of decisions just as like driving and things like that and maybe trying to vandalize things or violence but I’ve never heard of anything with marijuana doing anything like that 
So I don’t know 
I mean I guess if you just look at it 
Just from what I’ve said it kinda makes alcohol seem like it should be illegal and marijuana legal but I don’t know 
I mean I don’t think its really 
I don’t think alcohol is ever gonna go illegal and I’m sure marijuana is probably gonna become legal at some time so 

Um 
I think it would cut down maybe on on police having to focus on on arresting people for marijuana usage and 
I mean I know 
I know 
I’ve heard statistics on the rate for jail sentences are really high so arresting someone for marijuana usage and putting them in jail for it it would cost the government a lot more money then focusing on arresting people who are doing more destructive drugs or things like that 

Not really
