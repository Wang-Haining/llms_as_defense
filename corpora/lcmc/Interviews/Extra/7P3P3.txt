Um 
I don’t think it is an invasion of privacy because when it comes to students safety 
I mean there’s nothing more important 
Its lives where talking about not just uh 
Looking at uh 
Someone’s webpage 
There’s a big difference in how serious it is 
I mean 
It depends 
Well if the school went looking at the Myspace page before 
Like without hearing any rumors or had any reason to I think that’s wrong but if a student or a parent had brought the Myspace bulletin to the school’s attention then the school has every right to look at the note the bulletin 
And uh 
Myspace is like a public website 
I mean all you have to do is make an account and you can see people’s pages and all their personal info and if this person is posting a 
A public bulletin about 
You know threatening their school then they obviously know people are gonna see it then and someone needs to take action cause it’s 
It’s such a serious matter to threaten a school 

I think that they shouldn’t um 
Be looking into students personal lives unless there’s enough evidence or reason to 
Like if things 
Like I said if things are uh 
Brought to their attention I think they need to uh investigate 
And uh look into a students personal life more 
But other 
If 
They should have 
They shouldn’t be looking into a students personal life without reason 
I mean they shouldn’t be invading their privacy unless someone has told them about a threat or 
You know to school’s safety cause that’s the most important thing to the schools is keeping the students safe 

Um 
Well schools shouldn’t have the right to listen like 
To be able to track like students maybe like their cell phone use their text messaging their calls or you know things that go on in the home 
That’s none of the schools business 
Its 
There’s a 
The school has responsibility over the student for the whole time the student in the in the actual school 
I mean that’s when it’s the school’s responsibility but as soon as the student leaves the property and they’re 
They’re not in school then they have no reign really 
No control over the students and they shouldn’t be able to look into the students other life 
Their personal life their social life their family life 
They shouldn’t be able to look into that unless there is reason 
Unless uh 
Like if a concerned like parent or other student hears of a 
Another student threatening the school but it 
Even if it was outside the school not during the school day the school should be able to look into it because its it’s a major issue the students safety 

Um 
No 

Ok
