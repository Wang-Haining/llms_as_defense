Oh 
Um 
Hm 
I don’t have Myspace personally 

Um 
So this is where I’m going to be coming from 
Um 
That’s a hard 
Its like a very fine line I think because people use Myspace to 
Well actually 
No 
Here’s my real opinion 
I think Myspace is really stupid 

Um 
You know 
I have a bunch of friends that have Myspace and they put up 
They put pictures up 
My one friend actually is 
She like 
She lies about her age and stuff like that on there 

Its just creepy and I don’t think any of its legit 
I don’t understand why anyone would want it and 
I don’t know how exactly 
Well I guess cause you could just 
All you have to do is register for Myspace then you can look up anybody 

And um 
I think that if you’re putting it out there then you are assuming the responsibility for what you’re saying because they whole world can see it because its on the internet 
And if somebody finds it that’s not their fault if they come across it because you wrote it and you put it out there 
And it turned out that the threat was real 

And they ended up saving lives 

So 
I 
It’s definitely 
There’s a fine line for privacy and whatnot but if you’re putting it on such a public place where anybody in the entire world can have access to it 
You know 
I’d take that as a cry for attention 
That he needs some kind of help 
Um 
If he’s writing on his Myspace that he’s going to shoot up at the school 

So I think that it was not an invasion of privacy for them to stop 
Stop it because he 
He wrote it on the internet 

And yeah 

Um 

I think that things like 
Hm 
I don’t know 
I think 
I think there needs to be definitely 
Um 
Suspicion of some kind of illegal activity or something like that for them to even look at 
I don’t think they have the right to just randomly go through Myspace and look at people’s information or their entries or 
Um 
Facebook 
Like with Facebook everybody has Facebook 
That’s how you 
Pretty much how you get to 
Get friends before you go to college and you can like meet people and be like Facebook stalker see people on Facebook before you even know who they are 

And um 
I don’t think that 
Um 
School administration should be looking through Facebook 
Although they have the ability to because anybody can have it 
If you have a college email address 

I don’t think 
Um 
I don’t 
I just don’t think a school administrator should be sitting there like going through Facebook that’s not 
That’s an invasion of privacy 
 
But if there was some sort of 
Um 
They were given some sort of information where they had to be suspicious of somebody 
I think as a last resource they could use something like that 
Um 
But first 
I mean you need to confront the person look at the situation 
Um 
You can’t just go to the internet and 
Half the stuff you shouldn’t believe there anyway because people just write anything they want because they can 

Yeah 

Um 

Yeah 
Myspace 
I just feel like Myspace is just 
I don’t even know 
It kinda creeps me out because its just people anywhere absolutely like 
You can 
You don’t even 
I don’t know you just have to put any kind of criteria and all these things will show up 
And Myspace has a lot of 
I mean Facebook has a lot more security I think 
They just like changed it to where you get to control what people see and 
Um 
Because its like a college thing 
There’s no 
You have to have a college email address to go on it so you’re not gonna have like weird creepy little kids or anything like that 
Um 
Cause this girl that I mentioned before 
When she had her fake age on there she was actually 12 

And she was saying she was 17 online 

So 
You can’t have that on Facebook 
And a lot 
A lot of the things you have to have 
They have to be legitimate like 
It has to be a legitimate school you have to like 
Things have to match up and they like 
It has a good database I guess 
And um 
People use it to 
Really just like keep up in track with their friends and 
Its not 
It doesn’t have things where you can just like blog and write stuff all over the place 
Its more just like 
Updating and saying hello to people 
I’ve never had any kind of experience where it was somebody like pouring their soul out on Facebook 

Um 
I think 
Um 
I think until there’s some kind of reason for you not to think 
For you to think that something is going on everyone deserves their own privacy 
But if there’s a reason for 
Like a 
I guess schools or anything like that for people to suspect that you need help or you’re about to do something then I think that’s where they can over step that privacy line I guess
