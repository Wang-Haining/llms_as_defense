No 
I think that 
I mean if a school has to monitor 
It’s the school’s job while students are at school to monitor them so that they don’t get into into trouble and 
I mean with all the new technology and all the things that are coming out its turned into a job that extends beyond the classroom beyond school so 
I think that schools 
In order to prevent violence and other destructive acts should probably monitor things that could lead to potential problems 

Well 
Like right now 
I don’t know 
I mean I remember when I was little it was just like I’d go to school I’d do my homework and I would come home and I wouldn’t really think about school and 
While I was at school it was the teachers job to take care of me and monitor me and there was really no 
I guess there was a threat but it really wasn’t thought about and 
I know now with all the new 
I don’t know I guess new things and people 
It seems almost like a a 
Something that’s in style to do these school shootings and I mean to stop it you gotta do something so if a school can prevent it by monitoring like uh a Myspace or a Facebook or something like that they definitely should 
I mean 
I mean you have privacy to an extent when you’re planning on shooting people or killing someone that’s not private 
That’s not something that should be kept private that should be something that everyone should be made aware of and you should be prevented from doing that at all costs 

Um 
I think they should just draw the line at things that are destructive to the school and other students 
Um 
The school 
I mean has 
I guess the school official should 
It shouldn’t be taken into consideration other things that are on someone’s Myspace or things that people keep private as long as its not harming the school or other students so I think if anything isn’t harmful to the school or other students then they should draw the line at that 

Un huh 

Um 

Not really 
No
