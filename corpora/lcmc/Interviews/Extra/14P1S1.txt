OK 
Um 
I definitely feel that there is some gender 
Uh 
Discrimination still prevalent in the United States today 
Um 
Not 
Obviously not as bad as it used to be 

I think it would be a slow process to clean it up all the way 
Um 
Just 
Because 
One reason back 
Um 
Say forty years ago when 
Um 
You know 
It was a lot worse 
Those people are still 
You know 
Around 
And 
That’s what they grew up around 
So 
They’re used to that 
So  
Maybe some older people nowadays are maybe a little prone toward gender discrimination 
But 
Also just 
Um 
It’s definitely prevalent probably in the business world as well 
Um 
It’s 
You know 
It’s definitely cleaned up if you look at some stats of 
Like 
Uh 
College students around it’s actually a higher percentage of female nowadays 

So 
Um 
I think 
You know 
Following that trend it’s 
Maybe give it 
I don’t know 
Another ten twenty years it might be erased completely 
But 
I think it’s still getting there 

Um 
And 
Uh 
How we could better clean it up you said 

Um 
I think 
I mean 
All the 
Um 
Current day they’re doing a great job to try to change it 
There’s a lot of 
Like 
Um 
You know 
Groups even around campus groups 
And 
Clubs 
And 
Meetings about 
Um 
Um 
Female business leaders 
And 
Uh 
Just to change it 
Change it even more 
It takes a lot from the individual 
So 
Individuals just need to see them as a person 
And 
Not really by sex 
So 
If the problem is 
Um 
Trying to get everyone to see that way 
So 
I don’t know 
I think 
Um 
A good way to improve on it is just to keep those types of publicity around 
Keep those 
Keep people informed of why it shouldn’t be around 
Uh 

Just types 
Just learning 
And 
Through training 
And 
Stuff 
Like 
That 

Yeah I 
I think men would probably be too in certain situations 
Um 
You know 
It all just depends on the individual 
As a whole you can’t really 
You know 
Just stereotyping 
Um 
You know 
If you look at 
I’m sure certain women discriminate against men in the workplace if they’re 
You know 
Too feministic 
Or 
Whatever 

You know 
You know 
There’s chances of that 
But 
Say 
Um 
In a job where 
You know 
Primarily female 
Uh 
You know 
Such as like a nurse 
If there’s a male nurse 
Obviously there are a lot of them 
There could be discrimination from maybe their coworkers 
Or 
Also maybe from the clients as well just 
Because 
They’re kind of not used to that 
You know 
So 
They might see discrimination from both sides 
But 
Yeah it’s definitely both ways 

Well 
Yeah just 
I mean just looking at numbers is one thing 
You know 
Back 
Um 
Thirty forty years ago you would have the men out working the females back taking care of the house 
And 
Everything not even really thinking about 
You know 
Receiving higher education 
Or 
Going out to get a big time job for the most part 
Now you look nowadays 
And 
There’s 
You know 
Plenty of 
Um 
Double working parents 
And 
You know 
It’s like 
It’s the main thing now for both parents to work 
And 

Obviously females are receiving 
Um 
Jobs in the same 
Um 
You know 
As high as men are 
But 
Not as many right now 

So 
Back then it would be 
You know 
Very rare for that to happen 
Nowadays it’s definitely a lot better 

Yeah 
I mean just 
Loyola is an example 
I mean 
Loyola it’s probably close to 
I’m guessing sixty percent female 
And 
Um 
That’s 
Like 
A national number 
Not that number 
But 
It’s like 
Across the nation I believe 
It’s 
Uh 
More 
Just more females are attending college in a higher percentage than males now 
And 
You know 
It could be just the fact that when guys leave high school a larger percentage of them pursue careers that don’t involve college such as 
Like 
You know 
Blue collar jobs 
Or 
It could be that type of thing 
But 
It’s also showing that females are 
A higher percentage of females are attending college nowadays than they used to 
Because 
You know 
It used to be a lot bigger 
Um 
Percentage of men going to college 
So 

Um 
I guess just that 
The thought that 
You know 
The only way you’re going to solve it is if everyone has an open mind going into it you can’t 
You know 
Think one way or the other 
But 
It’s just a problem 
Because 
You know if there’s 
If there’s any bit of discrimination it could be a little contagious sometimes 
And 
If you grow up around that type of thing then it’s just going to be instilled in you probably 
So 
It just all comes down to the individual I guess 

Uh 
That’s it
