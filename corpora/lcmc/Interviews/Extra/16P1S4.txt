Um 
I actually still think it’s an issue 
I myself am Spanish 
And 
My mother gets discriminated against on a daily basis 
And 
At work 
But 
Uh 
I don’t really think there’s anything we can do about it 
It’s just 
Uh 
It’s people 
And 
You can’t really change people 
So 

Um 
Well I 
We’re Cuban 
And 
Uh 
I don’t know 
I guess with her being a woman and being Spanish 
A lot of times she gets talked down to 
And 
Uh 
Just assume she doesn’t really know anything 

I mean really you can’t do anything 
Because 
That would have to mean that you have to change people’s opinions 
And 
You can’t make people change their opinions 
They have to do that themselves 

Wait what 

I don’t know I think sometimes they are like 
I guess like 
Men of color 
And 
Uh 
But 
Definitely not as much as women 

Um 
Well I guess some people still believe that men are superior to women 

I don’t 
But 
Um 
It’s still a thought that’s out there 
So 

No
