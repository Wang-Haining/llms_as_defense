Um 
I think the war in Iraq is 
Um 
I think when it first started it was necessary 

And I think now the only reason we’re there is because if we leave now it’ll turn into another civil war leading to a dictatorship and another eventual war that will happen X many years down the road so 
I think there’s no real real solution 
I mean if we leave if we pull our troops out of there now then there’s never gonna be any lasting peace 

And if we leave our troops there more and more of them are going to die so its gonna be another war just like Vietnam 

Um 
I don’t know well 
I think after 911 we had 
Our country had to respond and we responded in Afghanistan 
We 
We 
I guess eliminated any threat from there and we got Saddam 
Er Osama Bin Laden whatever running around 

And then we 
We always knew that Saddam Hussein was a possible threat so we thought it might be with terrorists or whatever so we attacked there as well 
It just has turned into such a 
Such a 
I guess chaotic mess 
Its strange how it actually kinda mirrors what happened with our troops in Vietnam 
How we we entered into a war with Vietnam and we lost so many troops 
We actually lost more in Vietnam 
We lost a lot of troops and after we finally decided to leave the government of Vietnam still went kind of corrupt and I guess 

Against us 

Um 
I think there’s no real answer 
I mean I think with all these things there’s not much 
There’s really not much you can do 
I mean there’s a positive and a negative 
I think that we’re gonna have to keep troops there 
Some kind of troop presence there for as long as possible 
Maybe a solution would be to try to get the UN to to leave a permanent peace keeping force there or something 

Maybe just to give our troops a break 

Um 
Well I mean right now its mainly our forces and and England and no one else really and 
I mean 
I guess most of the world doesn’t see Iraq as a threat any more but I’m sure if any foreign troop presence like left the government of Iraq would certainly probably go 
Um 
I guess corrupted again so I think its in the best interest of everyone is some type of force was always left there just to make sure that they 
They stay peaceful until they can surely take care of 
Like maintain peace themselves 

Not really
