I think that 
Well 
I wonder what took them so long really 
Because there are other countries 
Um 
Like other European countries 
Where it’s not illegal for any amount of marijuana 
Um 
Marijuana has been shown to have 
Well 
I’m not even sure exactly how solid these clinical studies are 
But people have reported that marijuana helps 
Um 
Like 
Medicinal marijuana 
For glaucoma and such 
Things like that 
Um 
And also smoking marijuana is less harmful than 
For instance 
Smoking cigarettes 
So 
I always found that interesting 
How 
There’s so much more of a stigma attached to smoking marijuana 
When really it doesn’t form any 
Sort of 
Dependency on it as cigarettes do 
There’s no 
Sort of 
Addiction 
Except to 
I suppose 
Just a feeling 
But then again you can have the same addiction to chocolate 
How 
Like  
If you eat chocolate then you feel good 
And so you just have little 
It’s not technically dependency 
But you get 
Like  
A mental feeling 
Like it is 

I think so 
I think 
My main issue is 
That 
Cigarettes are so much worse than marijuana 
And yet 
Marijuana isn’t allowed and cigarettes are 
I mean 
Cigarettes contain things like 
Rat poison 
And 
Yet marijuana 
If it were legalized and standardized then it would be much much safer than alcohol or cigarettes 

Um 
Well  
I mean 
With 
I don’t 
I’m not like an expert on marijuana or anything 

But I don’t think that it’s possible to overdose on 
Like  
Marijuana as it is 
For instance 
For alcohol 
Like 
I’ve never heard of 
Like 
A case of marijuana poisoning or something 
Whereas 
You get ambulances coming down to Loyola for 
Like 
Alcohol poisoning and stuff 
And 
So 
I just think it’s a huge double standard to allow things like alcohol and cigarettes and not marijuana 
When really the effects aren’t as 
I think it’s more of the stigma that’s attached to marijuana that 
People are more against it 
Than actual 
Any sort of facts backing it up 

Not really
