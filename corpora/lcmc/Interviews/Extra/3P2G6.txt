Um 
I think that the sides that oppose 
Um 
Gay marriage are wrong 
I feel that 
Just cause our world has changed so much 
And especially 
Like not only our country but in other places where 
Um 
Homosexuality is not a big issue at all 
I feel that we are like extremely 
You know 
Behind 
Like we’re so technology like advanced but 
We’re still so far back on this thinking and 
Um 
I think that 
Even compare it to like 
In Greece 
Like Homeric times where gays were the only things that exist 
Um 
Like women weren’t seen as 
You know the people that you want to be with 
Like they wanted to be with men 
Um 
I think that its always just been like a natural thing 
And 
Um 
I don’t think that you 
That these people should be shunned for not liking 
For liking someone of the same sex 
I mean 
How can you say that a gay marriage 
That like 
Um 
A heterosexual marriage is all that can be 
Is the only one that allowed when 
Like heterosexual marriages 
I think over 50% end in divorce now 
So 
You can’t say that like there doing something right and 
You know homosexuals are wrong when 
These marriages are failing like rapidly 
So 
Um 
And I know someone 
Close to me who is 
Um 
Homosexual and I know that they would want to get married one day and to have 
To have them not be able to do that is I think 
It really upsets me cause I know that they are the same as me there relationship is just like the one that I have 
So 
I think that opposing gay marriage is just wrong 

Um 
I think that him banning gay marriages 
Almost just being ignorant 
Um 
I feel like he’s trying 
Like he’s 
Yes he is conservative 
He is a republican 
But 
Um 
Like you’re a president of a democratic country you should really 
Like 
Its making everyone happy 
Um 
And hearing everyone’s voice 
I think that 
Um 
The federal government stepping in is 
To ban it to is just 
Um 
Wrong and if they were to 
To do anything about it I think that they should just make it legal and say that it is allowed in every state 
Just cause I just don’t see how 
It 
It is seen as such an unnatural thing 
I think that it should be just as well excepted and allowed as 
Um 
A heterosexual marriage 

Um 
On what part 

Um 
Um 

Ok 
Just cause its two people in love wanting to deepen their love 
Have them 
Get themselves more of a stronger connection 
Um 
(pause) 
You know it’s the same thing that every man and women wants to do when they are 
When they fall in love 
Um 
You  know maybe that these people can’t have children but they still 
And if they want to create a family then they could adopt a child which 
Um 
A lot of people 
Which would help a lot of people especially like children in adoption foster care like where children have homes for themselves 
Um 
I just think that it really wouldn’t 
Not benefit our country 
I think it would make us more diverse 
Hopefully more accepting 
I mean 
I don’t know I just don’t really see the difference between the two 
If there’s love there 
If you want to have that commitment then I think it should be allowed 

Um 
No
