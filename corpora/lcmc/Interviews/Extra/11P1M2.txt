Ok  
Um  
Alright  
This is an interesting topic  
Um  
A lot  
I don’t personally smoke pot but a lot of my friends do and  
I feel like if it were legalized  
Um  
That they  
Not that  
I just feel like it wouldn’t be  
Well it wouldn’t be illegal so they wouldn’t feel like that risk taking thing and it wouldn’t be like  
Um  
So secretive  
You know  
They have to like go in the bathroom and shut the door and have like Febreeze everywhere  
[right –laughs]
(laughs)
Just to cover up the smell and like  
Everybody knows that they’re smoking but they have to cover it up anyway because it’s illegal  
But I think if it were legalized like if you’re over 21  
You can buy alcohol  
You can buy cigarettes when you’re 18  
I don’t understand if you wanna smoke pot like go ahead  
[ok]
Um  
I  
That’s weird  
I’ve never heard of that but  
Um  
I think like  
[can you describe what you mean about um saying that people have to go into private places and they feel like its illegal and that forces them to do it]
Yeah like  
Um  
There’s a bunch of guys that live down my hall and they all smoke pot and it’s like this huge thing they have to get the towels put ‘em under  
Like they go into the  
They have an apartment with  
Uh  
6 people in it so one of the bedrooms has its own bathroom  
And they go into the apartment and they close the door  
They close the bedroom door  
Put a towel under that  
Go into the bathroom  
Like 10 people in a bathroom  
And put the towel underneath that door and then  
Uh  
Put a fabric softener sheet over the vent in the ceiling and then they smoke and then they have to get  
They have this huge fan in their apartment  
And like I’ve seen this in other places too so its not just  
They’re not just being like overly neurotic  
[un huh]
Um  
And then they come out and they have the Febreeze  
They have an air freshener in the hallway like outside of their apartment there’s a little plug in the hallway and they have an air freshener there  
And  
Um  
Like they think that they’re all  
I don’t know like if they  
I don’t know if they think they’re like rebellious or they’re cool or whatnot  
Um  
Because its like  
Obviously they have to get it somewhere illegally  
[right]
And um  
You know a whole big thing is about how much pot you can get and  
[un huh]
Um  
Or like how shady the situation was when you got it  
Um  
So I think if it were legalized that would be taken away and then maybe pot would loose half of its appeal  
[ok]
Um I think a lot of people in college like  
My roommate and I were just talking about this actually  
Um  
We were like I can’t believe like every guy that we know they smoke pot  
[laughs]
(laughs)  
Its  
But its like people you would not expect  
Its so weird  
[really]
Yeah  
And um  
I was like talking to her and I said you know I really think that maybe its just a college thing  
You know  
They’re just trying it out  
Um  
I’m not  
You know  
Whatever it doesn’t really bother me  
Um  
But a lot of them do it because  
You know  
They have to  
Its kinda like why people  
Um  
Go to the bars with fake id’s  
You wanna see if you can get in  
[right]
I mean you could be  
You could do all that stuff at home  
Like you can drink and stuff at home but it doesn’t have the same excitement as being under age and getting into a bar  
[ok]
Um  
So I’m guessing the same goes for marijuana like if it were legal it probably wouldn’t have the same thrill of having  
You know like  
Every  
People  
Random people know each other because they get pot from them  
[right]
So it’s just like this weird shady network  
[ok]
(laughs)  
[um so I guess you kinda segwayed into this a little bit do you feel that marijuana and its effects are similar enough to alcohol that it should be legal]
Um  
I think they’re different  
Um  
My experience has been people who are high are actually probably less like disruptive then people who are drunk  
[ok]
Um  
[how so]
Like  
I  
I don’t  
I guess like people that I’ve been with when they’re high or  
You know seen people high they just like get into this state where they’re kinda  
Just like chill they  
[ok]
They don’t do anything they just sit there and no worries  
Whatever  
And kinda like comatose almost  
[ok]
Um  
Whereas when you have a bunch of drunk people and  
My friend is a desk assistant and she  
Like when she works the shifts from 12-4 in the morning  
Um  
She has a bunch bunch bunch of drunk people coming in from the night out and they’re  
You know they’ll do ridiculous things to her  
They’ll  yell  
They’re loud  
They’re  
Um  
They can’t walk they’re just making a scene  
Um  
But then I can go down to those people down the hall from me and they’ve all just smoked like three times maybe that night and there’s not a sound in the room because they’re just sitting there watching a movie  
[half passes out]
Exactly  
[do you have any other thoughts on this topic that you think you’d like to add]
Um  
Not really  
That kinda covers it  
[in general how you feel about ]
Um  
There’s also like the medicinal purposes of it  
Um  
I know that you can get it like legally for medicinal purposes  
But maybe if it were legalized like  
I don’t know maybe it would be more like  
This is weird  
Like over the counter  
[un huh]
Um  
I don’t see what’s to it  
I guess I just haven’t had like a bad experience with it where I can see what’s wrong with it  
[ok]
Um  
Yeah  
That’s about it  
[ok do you have any other thoughts]
No  
Not really  
[ok end of interview]
