That’s a pretty open ended questions 
Um 
Yes 
I think so 
I don’t think that 
Um 
Any 
Uh 
Organization that doesn’t change 
Uh 
Tends to do well you know as time progresses 

Sure 
Um 
I think in the last 
Uh 
Couple hundred years 
Um 
Technology 
And 
Uh 
Society is progressing at a rate much faster than 
Uh 
It was before 
And 
Um 
As different situations that previously couldn’t have even occurred do occur 
Um 
We we the catholic church needs to provide guidance in those situations 
If I can speak any more vaguely 

Nothing particularly 
I can’t really think of anything any particular issue 
Um 
I think perhaps issues of birth control 
I think  
Uh 
Issues of homosexuality 
Um 
And 
I mean those would be the top two that I could think of 

I’m gonna need a moment to think about that 

I think that in the case of pedophilia 
Um 
It’s pretty obvious that that action is not an acceptable one 
I don’t think that 
Um 
A church’s stance or claiming that priests who could not marry are somehow forced into this goes directly against 
Um 
What we what what we claim to be able to do by following 
Uh 
A higher moral standard 
I believe that we should be able to over come any sort of base instincts that we have 
Um 
Uh 
Because 
As humans we have the ability to 
Um 
To do that 
We’re unique in the world 
So I don’t feel that if somehow the church allowed these people to marry that priests would not be you know molesting children 
I feel that 
Um 
I feel that you know if we were worried about priests you know having sex with consenting adults as a result of not being able to be married then you know then that might be a better argument for that 

No I do not
