Um 
I do think that gay marriage should be allowed in the U.S. 
Especially since we’re supposed to be considered a free country 
Um 
When it comes to living your life 
I think you should be able to do what you want 
In regards to who you love, I don’t think that it matters whether you’re homosexual, heterosexual, asexual, omnisexual 
Does that exist?
I don’t think so 
But um 
I think that maybe it shouldn’t be called marriage because that’s something that’s reserved for the church but maybe it could be a civil union 
I think that they deserve to have the same rights that a heterosexual couple has when it comes to health insurance, death benefits 
If they’re living together, if they’re having the same kind of relationship that a heterosexual couple would have 
There’s no reason for them not to be 
Have that legal piece of paper that says that these two people have uh 
Promised themselves to each other and they are together 
And they can share the same benefits that a spouse does 
Yeah 
Um 
It seems to me that people are people, right?
So what does it make a difference if the person you’re attracted to either physically or emotionally is the same sex as you or a different sex 
It doesn’t make a difference 
It shouldn’t anyway 
Because at the end of the day, it’s just who you love 
And everyone loves in the same way 
Um 
I mean 
And if you want to be completely honest 
They deserve to suffer just as much as every other heterosexual couple that gets married and 
You know 
Ball and chain etcetera, etcetera 
And if 
I mean a lot of people also say that well 
The reason people get married is to have a family 
Then Ok 
Then people who are heterosexual and don’t want to have children should not be allowed to get married either 
You have to 
You can’t treat them different just because they are different 
Uh 
Sexual orientation 
It just doesn’t make sense 
It’s a logical 
According to the logic that runs our country 
Um 
Frankly I think that there is no reason for the federal government to be involved and 
A-choo!
Sorry.
Um 
And the fact that President Bush is 
Um 
Trying to put a constitutional ban on it bothers me on so many levels 
Partially because part of the reason he’s trying to ban it is because it’s not in the Bible and there should be a difference between church and state 
Um 
There’s a very big difference between church and state 
They shouldn’t be involved with each other 
And it also feels like he’s trying to push his personal views on the country as a whole 
Which isn’t right 
Um 
A person shouldn’t be penalized for loving someone 
If that makes sense 
It’s one of those things where how can you tell someone that they’re wrong for wanting to be in a relationship with someone and wanting to share their lives with someone else?
Mmhmm 
Um 
Federal government basically has no right to tell 
I mean the state government really shouldn’t either 
Unless they’re gonna put the same kinds of bans on heterosexual couples like if you’re not gonna have children you can’t be married or if you’ve only been together a certain amount of time 
I’ve heard that argument as well 
That homosexual couples don’t stay together as long as heterosexual couples 
Well the divorce rate among heterosexual couples is fifty percent 
It’s one out of every two marriages 
Ends in divorce 
So that argument is kinda out the window at this point 
Um 
You’d have to put the same limitations on everybody that you’re putting on these people 
Because they are like I said 
No different than anybody else 
It’s just in choosing who they’re going to love 
And it’s not even choosing 
Because you love 
Your heart tells you what to do whether your head likes it or not 
Um 
No 
I think just in general that they should be allowed to enjoy their lives and be together and suffer just as much as the rest of us
