Hmm 
Um 
We only have this and then one more time that I need to talk about the Iraq War 
Um 
Yeah 
I mean I feel hypocritical talking about it 
I mean I hate to say you know 
I hate to join the band wagon of people that are like oh I was against it from the beginning 
Um 
I was but like it’s not really important anymore 
Cause just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t want to admit that they were wrong 
And um 
I mean you just have to look at like the recent polls 
Um 
They’ve done United States polls 
They’ve done Iraqi polls 
They’ve done global polls 
And I mean no like 
About seventy five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks that it was a bad idea 
Eighty percent of Iraqis 
Um 
Seventy percent of the troops that are over there 
Like the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year 
Um 
I don’t know 
It’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in 
It was already a disaster 
And now pulling out is also going to be a disaster 
There’s really no easy way to go about really anything involving the Middle East anymore 
Um 
I mean I think it’s just 
Just the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states 
I mean it’s just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations 
And they think that they can just like bring Democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist 
Like that’s not the way that 
Um 
This totally different group of people would choose to run their lives 
I mean sure Saddam was a bad guy 
I don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he’s not 
But, I mean you have to weight the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to 
You know turn into just a complete disaster 
Just like quick sand from when we went over there 
Um 
I don’t even know what to say about it 
Um 
I don’t really see a reason at all to stay in there 
Um 
I mean I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there 
Um 
And you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out 
I don’t agree with them 
I’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should 
Um 
 I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year 
Um 
I guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that 
But, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now 
Um 
I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now 
And like these 
These are the people that we’re trying to save like that we’re trying to help 
Telling us to leave 
Um 
You know I think they might know better than that 
And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens 
You know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to 
Um 
And then you know at least we’ll 
I mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys 
Kind of 
Not really, no 
We’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East 
But, you know 
It’ll be better than you know where we are 
Where we stand right now 
Um 
Yeah 
Uh 
No
