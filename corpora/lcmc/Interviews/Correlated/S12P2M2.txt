Um 
I think that to a certain extent this the position of Denver is justified and not necessarily wrong 
Um 
The reasoning for this is that any drug or substance in moderation won’t cause extreme harm 
For instance alcohol when taken in small amounts or like I said with moderation isn’t harmful 
And 
Is even proven to help especially if you think of red wine and how it helps people with 
Um 
High blood pressure 
And 
Thinning the blood out 
So I think in moderation there are certainly drugs that they’re not necessarily bad and they’re not necessarily good 
But 
They’re not gonna cause harm 
And 
I think it would cause more harm to make them illegal 
And 
I think marijuana is one of those where in moderation which is what they’re promoting I don’t think it’s any worse than cigarettes which are legal or alcohol which is already legal 
I also think 
Um 
The potential benefits they’re getting from that are gonna be 
Uh 
Crime problems in the state of Denver it’s clearly gonna cut down on some of the illegal operations where people would otherwise have to obtain that substance so 
And 
Then additionally the states going to be making money 
Because 
They can now tax off of the sale of marijuana in the small amount 
So 
I think in the end 
The benefits are gonna far outweigh any 
Um 
Disadvantages to the selling as long as it’s just promoted in moderation 
And 
The fact that 
Um 
It’s gonna be taking crime and reduce violence that’s associated with the drug off the streets 

The disadvantages to not legalizing it like I said 
Um 
I think whatever violence 
Whatever 
Um 
Illegal transactions are currently going on will continue to go on 
And 
If they do decide to legalize it then any crime associated 
I mean clearly crime will still occur just because they’re not completely legalizing it in whatever amount they wish 
So 
Crime will still occur I just think it will be at a lesser rate 
Because 
Those people previously looking for small amounts 
I feel like the people 
Generally people who would use marijuana 
The average user would use it in moderation there 
People who are addicted and would use it daily so 
I mean for that large amount the majority using the substance their actions are now considered legal 
The state is now making money off of the sale of it 
Um 
The crime is cut down associated with it because it’s not happening behind the back of 
Uh 
City officials 
Or 
Officers 

Um 
I do 
I mean there are certain drugs 
Um 
More of the 
Um 
Potent narcotics I guess like ecstasy or speed or any of those other ones I think they’re pretty extreme and no matter what dosage you take them in 
Um 
As far as how people are using them currently being illegal I think that they’re not going to be good for the body 
But 
I’ve seen a lot of studies where the effects of marijuana in moderation are no more different than alcohol or cigarettes as far as short term and long term effects 

Um 
Really just what I already said about how in moderation I think it would not be harmful
