Um 
Initially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq 
I think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false 
And that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood 

Um 
It just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact 
Even Colin Powell 
I mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it 
And 
To me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that 
I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since 
Well since September 11th at least I mean 
I think that they 
Um 
They came into office with the intent to go to war 

Um 
That last part 

I forget the name of the 
Um 
Secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office 
Um 
But it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too 
Which is also very underhanded way to do things 

Well 
I do think it’s gone on long enough 
I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result 
Um 
I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like 
A coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order 
But I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because 
Um 
Iraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue 
A major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point 

Just from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all 
That um 
Oh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting 
I guess it was less then a year ago 
His party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government 
And I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that 

Um 
(laughs) 
None that I can articulate in polite company
