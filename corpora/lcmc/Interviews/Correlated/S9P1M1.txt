Let’s see
To legalize small amounts of marijuana for persons over 21

For any purpose

For their own personal use
Um
Well I I think that’s probably not a very good idea
I’m not really sure why it would really be necessary
Why they would decide that
Um
I can see
I can see an argument for legalizing medicinal marijuana in cases where you have
Uh
Patients at hospital who are suffering extreme amounts of pain
And they need something to to ease their suffering
Um.
So so small amounts of marijuana for that purpose
But to
In but in a country where 
Uh
Um
In a country where alcohol is is is the the the consumption and the use of alcohol is so restricted
Um 
I’m not
I’m not sure why they would start loosening the rules or the laws on on other types of drugs
Um
I would a whole lot more information as to why they have decided to do this
And and I would I would wonder is the state even allowed to do that
Or what kind of jurisdiction is that 
Is it state
Or is it federal
The like
Um
And so I would need more information about that 
Why they want to do it 
And
To what ends
And 
Um
I can’t think really think of any other any other town or cities or countries that have legalized the use of drugs except
Um
Wait there’s one country
Its
Uh
Holland I think or something like that
But
Um
So 
I mean I mean 
I mean is there any really 
Uh
Have they analyzed any of the results of the policies in these other countries
I mean I mean drug use is one of the biggest issues in 
Um
In America today 
And so 
I mean obviously the government does not want people using using drugs
So I would wonder why all of a sudden it would change with marijuana
Um

Um
Well let’s see 
To be honest I don’t know that much about marijuana and its effects
But I think 
That I wonder
Because I think I think if you just have a little bit of marijuana you become
You get into this state where it would take you a lot more alcohol to get into that state 
Um
I’m not sure
Because I mean even alcohol in in moderate amounts is good is good for a persons health
But I wonder does marijuana have any 
Um
Health benefits to it
Um

If that answers your question

O 
Um
Well
Let’s see
I because I know that there have been political arguments 
Um
Over the legalization
Over over the use of medicinal marijuana
And 
And
One of those arguments is that it’s
Um
Is that it can be used to relieve pain for 
For patients suffering extreme pain or terminally ill
Or something like that
So I I myself am not 
Can’t remember all the facts
Or don’t have all the facts right
So I don’t think that I can make an informed opinion about it myself
But I do think that 
There’s some merit to that argument 
And
Um
So but for just recreational use I’m not sure that I see the point


Well
It would 
It would probably be a lot easier to 
To gain access to 
Um
To marijuana
And therefore probably a lot more people who who had been using it could use it more frequently 
And maybe those who hadn’t thought about using it now that it’s legal would think about using it 
And and
Like any drug its its has a tendency toward addiction
Um
And
Um
Let’s see
Uh
Wait can you just repeat the question again

Uh

Right
Um
O that’s right you said legalizing small amounts
I wonder 
I wonder how much is how much is a small amount

But then if 
But then if they do give them small amounts it would 
It would seem that because 
You know
Er
Actually no nevermind that
Um
Other negative effects
Um
Well if they give them small amounts
And in the case that they do they do want more then I guess they would have to seek further legal ways 
To get more of the drug
Um
I mean it’s 
I don’t know
Our country hasn’t had the best experience with legalizing the use of drugs
Well at least well when the age for 
Um
When um
The age was lowered from 21 to 18 for for a
 to be able to get alcohol 
They they raised it back up
 pretty quickly
 I mean I’m not sure I can say say anything else
Sorry
I’m really I’m really need 
I’m trying to think 
But I would need more information

Um
I don’t think so
