Ok 
Um 
The war 
Um 
At first I was all for it because I was affected by nine eleven personally 
Um 
I was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much havoc as they did over here 
Um 
I do think that since it was such a like emotional thing that happened 
I think that we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run 
And we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan 
And um 
I really think that it backfired on us 
Um 
I uh 
I don’t know 
I was all for it 
But now I’m very against it 
I don’t think it did anything 
Um 
I think the people over there 
As long as they’re fighting with each other they can’t be fighting with us as well 
Like I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re 
If they can’t even get along with themselves 
So um 
Like unfortunately because of nine eleven I’ve almost just 
I just don’t care about what goes on over there 
Um 
With those people 
I just don’t care 
I just think 
I don’t think that 
Sometimes I don’t think they’re human 
I don’t know 
Like they fight with each other and they can’t 
They just can’t do anything themselves 
So I really don’t care 
Um 
I don’t know 
We definitely went over there just unprepared 
We didn’t know like what we were gonna face over there 
Um 
And it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war if for us 
They’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country 
I just think they’re looking to get us out of there 
And I think that should be fine for us 
I think we should just leave and that’s really it 
Um 
We just 
I think we were just more like 
Just hyped up than anything 
I don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and 
Um 
I just 
We pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened 
And um 
Also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq 
Um 
But at the time I see where he was coming from 
We really 
I don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it 
So 
Um 
I don’t think we could have let it go 
But I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do 
I don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order 
And I don’t know 
I just think that they didn’t 
There was no like unity 
They didn’t know what they were going in there for 
So I think that would have helped us out a lot more 
But like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with 
So that’s what we created in turn in there 
Um 
And 
Honestly I don’t 
I don’t think we’re the ones to change those people 
I honestly think they’re always going to be like that 
And um 
I don’t 
I really don’t have anything else to say 
It’s gone one definitely long enough 
Um 
I don’t think we’re making enough progress 
Like we’ve made progress 
But not enough to stay in there 
And I think no matter how long we stay in there 
Once we leave, it’s just gonna collapse 
And we can’t stay over there forever 
So I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there 
No 
Ok
