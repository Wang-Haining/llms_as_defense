Mmhmm 
Ok 
Um 
Actually I think that 
Um 
It’s such a really complicated topic 
That I do 
I feel like people need to understand that everyone is just the same and we all are human beings 
And people are so focused on 
It’s just like 
It’s a big thing about 
Like there’s no separation of like church and state anymore 
No separation of church and the people’s 
And the people’s just regular feelings because church in like many people have been so wound up into them and are apart of who they are 
They automatically that Ok the Bible says no 
But in realistically if you really look at it 
They’re still human beings just like everyone else 
And yeah they’re things 
Yeah what they do and their sexual life is not the same thing 
But it’s kinda like 
It’s like 
To me it’s like another form of racism 
Although you can’t see it 
It’s like saying I don’t like this person because he eats chicken 
You don’t know that he eats chicken until he tells you that eats chicken 
And you don’t know that someone’s homosexual until they say they’re homosexual 
Uh keep goin? 
Ok 
So I feel like you just 
You can’t 
It’s like another form of just not being able to just come and be who you really want to be because of the fact of other people’s opinions 
And I think that as 
Cause in our generation 
Like in the younger generation 
We’re like the group that is more so 
We’re not 
We’re like tolerant of it 
We don’t necessarily accept it 
But we’re very tolerant of it and we’re not like all trying to be up and in everyone’s business and trying to figure out what they do 
We’re trying to live our lives and do what we want to do 
And it’s not fair to 
And we’re just like 
Well you know well if that’s what they want to do 
It has nothing to do with me 
So why do I have to be 
You know 
In their business, in their lives, telling them what they can and can’t do 
You know 
It’s just like 
And I think that when people look at it 
Like and make rules on the fact that gay people can’t get married 
It’s just like I think they’re scared because I think they’re like 
It’s like a fad 
Like you know 
It’s just something that this generation’s going through 
It’ll leave after a couple of years 
And they I think are also scared not to make any big rules and not to change anything in the Constitution 
And make it 
You know 
Not do anything about it because they’re like what if this ends in a couple of years 
You know 
And so they’re like what’s 
You know 
So I think they’re just trying to hold it off as much as possible to really see how strong it is 
And I think that 
You know 
These are one of these things that it doesn’t come without a struggle 
And just like 
Um 
Slavery and legalizing 
Um 
Black 
African American’s rights and even African Americans’, Latin Americans’, everyone’s rights 
That weren’t like 
Regular Caucasians 
They had to go through something to get it 
And I feel like this is one of the other things like that we have to overcome or 
Yeah 
I can’t say we 
We have to overcome 
It’s just that we have to realize like 
We have to just let it see if it’s something that is worth 
You know 
Being put into 
Being worth legalized because in states’ laws you can say well 
You know 
We can change that 
And we can do that 
You know 
We can reword things 
If you have to 
If you put it into the Constitution of the United States 
That’s something that you can’t change 
It has to go through like the Senate, and the House of Representatives and all this other stuff in order to actually get amended and changed and stuff 
So I think it’s something that we’d have to wait out and see if it’s actually 
You know something that needs to happen 
And also I think that when the older generation like our parents and stuff 
When they 
It’s sad to say die off 
Like when they are like you know 
Pass away or whenever 
That’s when I think a lot of the more accepting laws will start to come in 
And a lot of the more laws that are just like well Ok I understand and you know we’re tolerant of this and we can kind of move past like that fact that 
I don’t know 
I feel like overall, towards the end 
People are just gonna see they’re human too 
And we just need 
Like you can’t 
Like we don’t accept this human’s ways 
Like that’s not fair 
Like that’s not 
Like also like I said before 
That’s like saying that we don’t accept the fact that you eat chicken 
It’s kinda like 
I feel like it’s really kind of the same thing 
Um 
I don’t think they should be involved in it because of the fact that they have bigger things on their plate right now 
[laughter] 
And I think that while they’re 
Um 
Over there 
While they’re in Iraq 
Like the have the whole Iraq thing and you have people over there dieing from like what you’re doing over there 
And it’s not even a clear war 
But you’re worrying about the fact over how people live their lives 
And like it’s weird to say because it’s like you know 
Aren’t we like put 
That’s the purpose of coming to America 
Being able to do things freely 
And as long as like 
Being gay doesn’t hurt you, it doesn’t kill you, it doesn’t 
You know 
Yes, it is one of the main things that spread AIDS 
But the thing is like would it spread AIDS as much if it was more accepted? 
And would you know 
If it was more accepted and people could 
You could like start implementing stuff about gay marriages at school and start saying how you know it’s important for you to use like all these different contraceptives and stuff 
Will people actually be as bad as it is now? 
So I think that personally 
Um 
Like Bush has enough stuff on his plate 
He’s voted as like the most hated President in the United States right now 
So [laughter] 
I don’t think he really needs to be worried about that 
And I think that he needs to 
I mean I think that’s also one of those things like he’s having his 
Um whole 
I forgot 
I think he’s like Methodist or Baptist or something like that 
Is his religion 
I forgot what it was 
And I think that if he’s letting that get in on what he wants for his 
Um 
Like for the U.S. and I swear I thought that the whole idea of government and like the church is that there’s a separation of church and state 
And there was a point where the government was ruled by church and was ruled by church leaders 
And now that’s the point of having a government 
Having like a Pope and the bishops and stuff 
Is to keep everything separate 
I think he’s leaning on his religion instead of thinking about the fact that 
You know 
These are Americans and these also 
They also have 
Should have the same rights as all the other Americans 
So if they like 
If they’re gay then it’s like saying well you’re not American 
And if you’re not American take away the citizenship 
Like that’s what you’re gonna do 
Just because of what they want to do it in their own time and their own place 
Like why not? 
You know? 
Yes, one more thing [laughter] 
And also I feel like definition of a marriage it’s like when who 
A couple, a domestic couple that stays under one roof for like a certain number of years 
And I feel like that’s 
Like in the dictionary that’s what it says a marriage is 
So 
I feel like he’s really stuck on the whole idea of traditionally it’s always been a man and a woman 
But imagine like how cool of a 
Not cool but like how awesome of a President he would be if he could change something 
To do something radical 
And it’s like I feel like some presidents are so stuck on that 
Like that’s why I’m more 
I’m really excited about the 2008 elections because now we’re having people that are not stuck on this whole thing of you know 
Not stuck on tradition 
Here you have two Democratic presidents running to be the first woman president and the first black African American man to be president 
So you got 
There’s a lot of big changes about to come up 
So 
I mean Bush is about to be president for what? 
Another couple of months or something like that 
So hopefully is he doesn’t 
Cause he 
I mean he has all those months to make big changes like implementing 
Like say banning gay marriage and stuff 
So 
Hopefully he doesn’t do anything yet and we can hold him off 
Ok not I’m done 
Nope 
Ok
