How do I feel about the war 
Um 
I 
I mean I personally have anyone over there that I know or 
Um 
No family members or anything 
Um 
I don’t really have strong feelings about the war in Iraq 
Whether we should be there or not be there 
I don’t listen to the news that often 
Or 
I mean 
I know 
Or read the newspapers very much 
But 
I mean as long as 
My family is safe and I’m safe and there’s not fighting going on over here 
I support it 

Um 
I support it because 
When my history class now and all my past history classes you’ll 
We’ll read about like the war 
World War 1 and World War 2 and the devastation it brought and then you’ll hear 
I’ll hear stories of 
Um 
Just from Iraq 
Like I know one of my neighbors went over on vacation to Iraq 
She was just 
I don’t know what she was really doing there 
But she went and she said that you always see 
You constantly hear bombing 
There’s just a lot of 
Devastation and turmoil and whatever else 
And I would hate to have to grow up in that 
I would hate to have to 
Hear bombing 
Be afraid of getting shot 
Just anything 
I would  
Um 
As long as we’re over there fighting and they keep it away from the United States and 
That’s good 

Um 
Do I think it should continue 
I think they need to stay there 
Um 
I think we need to have a presence over there 
Because after 911 I don’t know what was going on then 
If we had a presence there 
But 
If they’re preventing something from that 
Like that happening again then yes I think they should stay there 
And no it hasn’t gone on long enough then 

Um 
Ok 
I think we should continue the war because 
Um 
Just because we 
When we were attacked on 911 that was such a horrible thing and nothings has happened like that since then so that makes me want to believe that gives reason that we’re doing something 
Something’s working 
So 

Um 
No
