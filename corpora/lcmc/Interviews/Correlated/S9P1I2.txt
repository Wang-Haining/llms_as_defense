Ok 
The war in Iraq 
Well 
To start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war 
Before invading Iraq and I think there was 
I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other 
But the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 
Um 
I 
I myself and pretty much against war so 
Especially to make a preemptive strike I was against that 
Um 
And I think that it’s 
The war in Iraq is kind of 
A 
A repeat in many ways of um 
The Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with 

I mean the 
A tremendous amount of American soldiers have died 

And that’s horrible and 
What they were 
What they were doing is that they were taking out 
They were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government 
The American government was prepared for the um 
What 
For the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur 
Um 
And here 
And the government 
And so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and 

They are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam 
They were trying to push out Communists 
And 
And uphold or implement 
Implement and uphold democracy 
And 
And its 
And its 
And the government 
And the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t 
That was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear 
I mean it was more of a 
It was more of a loss in Vietnam because 
Because 
Um 
Because there because there are there are 
No matter how many people may have supported 
No matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting 
An actual army 

You’re fighting the citizens the 
Specific citizens in the country and 
So 
So I think 
I think that the government 
So first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and 
But if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be 
You need to plan for all possible outcomes 
I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been 
I mean worst 
And 
Either for what would 
Really not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and 
I mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still 
Um 
Many American troops are still dying and 
And there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi 
And the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that 
That that the US government in a way tried to 
Well they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a 
A 
A short successful stay in Iraq and 
I mean we shouldn’t 
We’re kinda 
We’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful 
I mean in our own country 
Democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was 
There was lots of tension and there was civil war and 
Um 
Its just not an easy thing to do and I think the government 
The US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do 
And 
Um 
So 
And so 
Let’s see 
The war in Iraq 

Well that’s 
No that’s 
No that’s a difficult decision to make because 
That was 
Well that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election 
Like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of 
Um 
One of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and 
And so I mean once 
Its really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people 
I mean we’re the ones that took away their government and 
And 
And their way of life so how can we abandon them 
Absndon them now so 
So its probably something that we should 
(coughs)
Excuse me 
Try to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and 
And 
And how 
And how much is is too much to to to keep risking for 
For a free democratic Iraq 
I mean 
Going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq 
I mean if we’re
If we’re 
If we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq 
Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is 
Is the 
Is the oil issue
And this is where we are getting our oil from
And it’s usually all about money and controlling resources
I mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction
And no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found
And yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them
So I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions

Let’s see
Um
I just hope that it ends soon
And there will be peace there soon
But probably not
