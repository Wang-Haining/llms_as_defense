Um 
That’s definitely a 
Uh 
A mixed feeling for me 
Um 
Let’s see 
I feel 
Well 
It’s very awkward because I believe 
You know 
The national law prohibits marijuana 
Um 
But 
For instance 
I don’t feel marijuana should be illegal at all 
Um 
I figure 
You know 
If people want to do stuff to their body 
Um 
You know that’s perfectly fine 
I’m sure it’s a good time 
I’ve never done it before 
But 
You know 
I don’t see anything wrong with it 
Um 
Let’s see here the 
Uh 
Apparently marijuana’s never killed anybody 
Uh 
That’s what I’ve always heard 
Um 
Like nobody has ever died from it 

Um 
If you look at the effects compared to alcohol 
Um 
Let’s see here like you know if 
Like say you have an alcoholic parent 
Or 
Um 
Two of them 
Uh 
A child could possibly be beaten 
Um 
And 
Very verbally abused or 
Um 
You know 
Things such as that 
But 
Let’s say if you have like a pot head parent or 
You know 
Something like that 
Um 
I don’t feel it would be 
I mean 
You know 
It would be very bad 
Um 
But 
I don’t feel as though it would be that bad 
You have the idea of I guess 
Um 
Like them ignoring their children if they’re 
Um 
If they’re 
Uh 
You know 
If they’re stoned all the time 
Um 
Which is not good 
Because 
Children need attention 
Um 
But 
On the other hand 
You know 
Most of the time I can’t really see 
You know 
If they’re just sitting there they’re not going to be beating their children like an alcoholic 
Um 
I just feel as though it should be treated on the same level as 
Um 
Alcoholic products though 
Um 
I like the fact that it is over twenty one 
Um 
And 
On the other hand 
Um 
You know 
Well not on the other hand 
But 
It could be treated in the same way such as like driving 
Um 
It can’t be in an open thing in a car 
Um 
You know you can’t drive with any anything in your system at all 
I think it’s just 
Like 
I’ve known 
Um 
Different people like 
Uh 
One of my friends had 
Um 
Driven on the wrong side of the road while he was high 
And 
Well he’s never smoked pot after that 
Because 
It was such a scary thing 
So obviously it should never be allowed in a car 

And 
Now if you look at 
I’ve also heard of somebody who had a mom that smoked pot 
And 
Everything turned out fine 
Um 
There was nothing wrong with it 
Um 
She wasn’t like ignored or anything 
It was a perfectly normal life 
I believe the father had actually passed away 
Which may have caused her to 
Um 
Smoke the substance 
But 
Um 
You know 
I really don’t see any harm in it 
You know 
Um 
People just do it to make themselves feel good 
Um 
I guess to have a little escape 
But 
Um 
No I don’t feel as though there’s a problem with that at all 
And 
I feel as though marijuana should definitely be legalized within the country 
Um 
But 
I don’t know exactly how I feel with Denver legalizing it against the country’s policy 
I don’t know exactly how that would work out 
Whether people could still get in trouble for that in a 
Um 
And 
Then if you go on 
Um 
For instance my mom has glaucoma 
Um 
And 
I know you can 
Somewhere I don’t know 
You know Denver 
Um 
Smoke pot in order to help that 
Um 
I can never imagine my mom smoking marijuana 

Um 
That would kinda be funny 
But 

You know 
There’s also other ways to 
Uh 
Treat that 
It is a hassle 
Because 
My mom she needs to take eye drops every day 
Otherwise she could possible go blind 
But 
Um 
I don’t know 
Um 
You know 
There’s different ways to treat that as well 
Um 
If the marijuana doesn’t need to be used 
But 
If it is used I don’t see anything wrong with it 
Um 
You know 
You feel good while you’re trying to treat something 
You know 
What’s wrong with that 
Um 
So overall I think marijuana should be legalized within the country 
But 
I think it should be legalized in the entire country 
Not just one specific city against the country’s policy 

Um 
Yes I do 
Well obviously I’ve never experienced marijuana so 
Um 
Um 
Yeah you know 
I feel as though it should be treated 
Like I said before 
Uh 
You know 
I shouldn’t be in a car whatsoever 
You know 
You can’t drive at all 
Um 
And 
You know 
Especially if the country legalizes it they would be able to cut down on the black market 
Um 
Because 
Like 
The 
Gosh 
Pot’s I guess I wanna say industry underground in the US is huge 
Um 
Let’s see 
You know 
The money brought in by that is 
Like it’s amazingly huge 
Um 
So 
You know 
The country might as well 
You know 
First of all they could monitor it so it’s not laced with anything 

Um 
And 
Then second of all they could 
You know 
Um 
Have 
Uh 
I believe the word is 
Uh 
Sin taxes something I learned it in micro I don’t know 
Um 
Trying to be smart here 
But 
Um 
It’s basically when 
You know 
You tax heavily things that 
Um 
You don’t want everybody to abuse 
For instance the country taxes heavily pornography and alcohol 

Because 
They don’t want 
Um 
Huge consumptions of that 
So they could be doing that as well 
And 
Therefore also making a profit 
Increasing the 
Um 
I don’t know 
You know 
They could put that money into maybe schools or the military or something of that sort 
But 
It would definitely help out the country a lot 
Because 
So many people do smoke pot 
And 
People are just going to do it behind the country’s back so 
I don’t feel as though 
Um 
Having it illegal is going to help at all 
I definitely think it should be legalized 
And 

That’s about all I got to say about that 

Nope that’s it
