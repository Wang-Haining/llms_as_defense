Um 
Did they say it’s over 21?
Ok 
Um 
I 
I don’t 
I’m really not sure how I feel about this 
The only thing that I can really say for sure is that if they’re gonna legalize it for 
And like put an age in there 
I don’t see why they should distinguish between amounts 
Like what’s legal and what’s not 
I don’t know who is like 
Who really has the authority or knowledge to know what’s a small and what’s a large amount 
Um 
Hmm 
I think that would be just an ongoing debate forever 
I think if they wanted to legalize 
Then legalize it for people over 21 just like they alcohol 
And they just have to leave it up to the person to know what’s a small amount and what’s a big amount 
So um 
I’m not really sure about that 
I don’t agree with the use of marijuana to begin with 
But um 
I think if it 
It’s almost like in Amsterdam where it’s all legal 
Like I feel like it might even be beneficial if we legalize it to some extent 
Especially for people over 21 
Because I think kids 
Like younger kids in their teens and whatever who are just experimenting with it 
I feel that one of the big reasons why they do is because that it’s illegal and because they’re not supposed to do it and they’re going against what their parents and teachers have been drilling into their heads for years 
Like don’t do this, don’t do this 
So I feel like it’s just an 
Like almost an adrenaline rush 
Like it’s not even the high that they get of it 
I think it’s just the sneaking around doing it 
That’s where they like get their high off of 
So I feel like if there was an age limit and it was somewhat legal 
In a sense I don’t think that it would be as popular as a drug 
And like I said like in my essay, it’s not like 
It’s not like this drug is proven to be like that harmful for you 
It is over time 
But I mean it’s more of a gateway drug to like you know more intense drugs like cocaine and stuff 
I think if we do legalize it and people start using it less 
There’s less of a chance that people will go on to use like more hardcore drugs I guess you could say 
So I think it has it’s you know 
Positives and negatives 
But I mean I think it’s just going to be an ongoing debate 
I do 
I think they pretty much do the same thing and alcohol 
I mean it’s not really 
It’s not gonna kill you if you do it once and you do it at a responsible 
You know 
You just drink enough 
Not 
You don’t overdo it 
Um 
I think marijuana’s the same way 
I think if you use both substances a lot it could be a problem 
But if you use it in moderation 
I don’t think it’s that bad for you 
And I don’t know 
I have 
I mean I have friends that do it and they’re some of the smartest people I know 
So that makes me 
It just makes you wonder like is it really that harmful? 
So I mean I still think we need to do a lot more research on it 
But um 
I think it’s definitely similar to alcohol and 
Um 
They should definitely set an age limit and then just leave the amount to the person 
Like just let them decide what’s a lot and what’s a little 
And I mean because you have to 
You can’t be going around and not only checking if they’re 21, but checking if they have the right amount on them 
I think that would be just too much and almost pointless 
So I don’t know 
No
