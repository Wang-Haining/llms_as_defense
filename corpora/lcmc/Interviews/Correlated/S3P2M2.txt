Well I think it kind of 
Um 
Goes against the whole we should be moving away from drugs 
And 
Cracking down on cocaine use and crack houses and stuff in the cities 
And 
I think 
Um 
I think that sends a message that not all drugs are necessarily bad 
And 
That maybe we should be going the other way instead 
And 
Making alcohol a little 
Not like prohibition 
But 
Like harder to get a hold of especially for minors 

Because 
I know going to college a lot of people have alcohol marijuana whatever just in their rooms 
And 
They can get it whenever they want 
And 
I mean 
Who decides what a small amount of marijuana is 
Who decides how much marijuana is safe 
Because 
You can get addicted to a very small amount 
Well you can get addicted to alcohol too 
But 

That doesn’t necessarily make it right 
And 
Also who decides that it’s appropriate for twenty one year olds to be smoking marijuana 
And 
Like 
Who decides when they can use it 
Like 
Is there gonna be a new test for marijuana blood content 
Like if you’re driving under the influence now 

I think it’s gonna be more of a hassle than anyone considered in making that 

Well I think in small amounts yes 
But 
Making it legal in small amounts how do you determine that someone just gets a small amount 
Because 
In large amounts marijuana is also a hallucinogen 

And 
Other stuff 
And 
I think 
Um 
I think it has effects on the brain that don’t necessarily go away as quickly as alcohol 
Like you can consume small amounts of alcohol daily and it’s good for you 
Like red wine is supposedly good for your heart and stuff 
As long as you don’t drink enough to damage your liver 
Or cause brain damage 
But 
Marijuana doesn’t get filtered by your liver 
It just like 
I don’t even 
I’m not sure what it does 
I know it affects your brain 
But 
I don’t know how long it stays in your blood stream or anything like that 
So 
I couldn’t really say 

No I just think it’s kind of silly 
Because 
They say small amounts but how do you prevent someone from just going to the next marijuana store or wherever they’re gonna sell it once they get their small amount for the day 

That’ll make it so much easier for people twenty one and over to resell the marijuana to younger kids 

So I don’t know 
I just don’t think that really seems like a good idea
