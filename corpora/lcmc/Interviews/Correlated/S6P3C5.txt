Yes 
Um 
I’m a life long catholic and 
I think that the kind of patriarchal hierarchy that’s 
Kind of been the structuring point of the Catholic Church for so many centuries now is kind of starting to fall apart 
I think that they’re adhering very closely to dogma 
That really isn’t relevant in the 21st century and wasn’t even relevant throughout most of the second half of the 20th century 

Um 
I think that they do well to consider 
Um 
Ordaining women for one 
But again that’s not something that’s going to change anytime soon probably 
And I think that even the abuse scandals that we’ve seen within the last few years are really evidence that it’s really become more of a fraternity then anything else it’s kind of a good boys association where they protect their own 
And I think that the fact that they  have tax immunity and they’re granted so many special privileges in so many places that’s led to that kind of systemic abuse 
And I wouldn’t say that they’re a bad thing overall 
I mean 
Like I said I’m a life long Catholic 
But I think that it’s an institution that really needs to change itself from the top down 

Yeah 
I mean 
I think that one of the reasons that’s been happening is because the emphasis on celibacy has been to such a great degree that 
Really priests don’t have many other outlets 
I hate to say it like that 
But I think that’s really what’s been happening 
Because the experts you listen talk talk about this kind of thing always say that these aren’t these priests who are committing these 
These abuses really aren’t necessarily homosexual 
They’re just extremely repressed and I think that the structure of the church has been promoting that 
Kind of on a subconscious level almost 
And I think that allowing 
Ordaining women priests and even allowing priests to marry would be a big step in the right direction preventing that kind of behavior 
I think 
Even like Episcopalian priests who decide they want to convert to Catholicism are allowed to keep their wives 
So clearly the Church doesn’t have quite the same issues with it that did begin with 
From what I recall from like my historical theology classes in high school the Church originally instituted celibacy not because they saw it as some kind of religious requirement but because priests were bequeathing the church land on to their on to their children when they died and that was causing financial problems for the church 
So really I think it was something that was motivated by 
Financial 
Financial pragmatic reasons from the beginning and I think that’s something that really isn’t as relevant as it was 
I guess in the 5th century thereabouts 

Um 
No 
None particularly
