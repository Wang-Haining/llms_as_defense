Um no 
Uh 
When you put something on the internet it is public forum 
It is completely public 
You cannot 
I mean as an R.A. it’s something that I’ve actually had to deal with already 
Um 
You put something out there 
It’s going to color people’s opinions of you 
And if you’re talking about blowing things up or if you’re talking about shootings 
Someone’s gonna say something 
You can’t put that out there 
Put that to the world 
The internet is seen by everybody 
If you’re friends with that person on Myspace you get that bulletin 
Obviously it wasn’t the school that got the bulletin 
Somebody went to the school 
And they have to act on that 
They can’t let it sit because then God forbid something does happen, they could have prevented it 
[Right]
Then again, you don’t know what to take seriously because some people do just fool around like that 
I mean it could be like the situation we had at school 
It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a 
For um 
A sociology class 
Sorry couldn’t remember the word for a minute 
And it could also be something very serious 
I think 
Well what happened here was that um 
Something happened and somebody overheard somebody saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was they looked through 
A friend of his looked through his Facebook and got very worried because there was some certain things on there that he may have meant as a joke 
But in light of the situation became very serious 
When you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet 
There’s really no invasion of privacy that happens 
If you don’t want it out there don’t put it there 
If you don’t want somebody to find it 
If you don’t want somebody to think something of you 
You can’t tell them what to think 
You can’t tell people what to take seriously or not 
I mean I don’t think school officials should be friend-ing their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking 
And going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals 
But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials 
There’s really no invasion of privacy there because it’s brought by someone who you gave access to it 
And if there’s danger they have to take it seriously 
I mean like I said I don’t think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IM’s and 
If it’s brought to their attention then it’s something completely different 
Um 
Yeah don’t 
Like a teacher should not make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that’s just 
It’s the same thing 
I wouldn’t friend my residents because frankly I don’t want to know if they’re going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook 
Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it 
It’s not my place so I don’t even want that 
That connection there 
Um 
Not really
