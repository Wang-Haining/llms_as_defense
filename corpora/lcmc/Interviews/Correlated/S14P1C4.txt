Um 
Uh well 
Let me start by saying 
Um 
I don’t really care what the Catholic Church does at all 
Um 
I’m not a member of any church actually 
Um 
I’m more like my own personal beliefs 
You know just like that if you believe in a higher power I guess you’re spiritual journey or whatever 
Um 
Shouldn’t have to go through like a medium of a church 
Or uh you know a Pope, bishops, they shouldn’t be someone in between you and your whatever high power you believe in 
Um 
That being said, that uh 
The Catholic Church does exert um 
A lot of power 
Certainly not as much as it used to 
But still over like a ton of people 
Um 
I guess 
Um 
I mean that’s the only real problem I have with the Catholic Church 
Um 
Cause I mean if you want 
I mean you can feel free to believe whatever you want 
And if like the doctrine of the Catholic Church is what you want to believe in that’s fine 
But, um 
You know it’s not necessarily so many Catholics have the opinion that that’s like the only true like religion I guess 
And uh 
Um 
They’re just so many other different types of churches that um 
Yeah 
 I don’t really know where I’m going with that 
But 
Um 
I mean kind of the point though is that they’re not different religion 
I guess 
I mean they’re all 
I mean yes there are different religions you can believe in 
But um 
The view of like a lot of Catholics that I know is that Catholicism is Christianity 
It’s the only like 
They don’t see these other churches I guess as Christian because 
Um they’re synonymous with each other 
Um yeah 
Um 
Well I mean that’s kind of hard just to lay blame for such 
You know for accusations such as that 
Like just to like certain like something like that like not allowing women priests or whatever 
Um 
I mean I think 
My opinion, a lot of these priests accusations were 
I mean they just kind of all came out at the same time 
And I think there may have been like a few legitimate ones 
But just building just like people saw the money that could have been made filing these accusations 
And uh 
You know it just sort of got out of control 
Um 
But I mean I don’t think necessarily that the Catholic Church has to change though 
Um 
Because like they’re just so many different like hate to bring up other branches of Christianity again 
But I mean let’s say you want 
You like the Catholic Church except for like one saying that you disagree with let’s say it’s
Um 
That there aren’t women priests
Uh 
I mean then there’s another church that’s you know for you that’s what you believe in 
Um 
If you disagree with priests not being able to marry and there’s probably another church that fits that 
You know 
Um 
So I mean I think it’s good that there are like different uh branches of Christianity that you can believe in and that are like 
Like that display the full like range of beliefs that one may have 
My only problem is that the Catholic Church has too big an influence 
I think if it was more 
I think a lot of people just like believe in Catholicism because it is the largest religion so they figure that must be the correct one 
Um 
I just think that needs to change 
Um 
Just I don’t know 
I mean it’s hard to like say that they need to become a smaller church because like there’s really no way that that’s going to happen 
Um 
In fact the only thing that’s like going to turn people off from Catholicism among other religions is 
Are like when you know bad, immoral things happen within the Catholic Church 
So you don’t really want that either 
So I don’t know 
I guess it’s kind of a catch 22 
Um 
Yeah 
 I don’t know I mean I don’t really think there’s a legitimate way to change 
Um 
Like what I feel is wrong with the Catholic Church 
So 
Um 
Not really.
