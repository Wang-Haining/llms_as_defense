Um 
Let’s see the war is definitely controversial 
Um 
Within our country right now 
Um 
I feel 
Um 
As though the country should definitely back President Bush up 
Um 
I am a registered conservative 
But 
I guess you could say I have moderate views 
Um 
Let’s see here 
The uh 
I feel as though if there’s a leader 
Um 
Of a group of people 
They won’t be able to do anything unless they have the support of their 
Um 
Of their followers 
Um 
Like 
For instance 
We got a lot done 
Uh 
After September eleventh when everybody was gung-ho 
Um 
And 
Now if you 
Now if you look at the country today 
I guess you can say George W. is still kinda gung-ho 
And 
Everybody has kind of died down a little bit 
Um 
Which is kind of sad 
Because 
Nowadays 
You need something bad to happen in order for us to unite 
That’s what I noticed after September eleventh 
Um 
It shouldn’t be that way at all 
I feel as though everybody should always back up their leader 
Um 
I had actually 
Uh 
Trekked out into the mountains in New Mexico 
Uh 
I believe two summers ago 
Uh 
With a group of eleven people 
And 
We hiked like I don’t know sixty-five seventy-five 
Something like that 
Miles in the mountains out there 
And 
I was actually the crew leader 
And 
Um 
Everybody was always backing me up one hundred percent 
But 
There was this one kid that really disliked me 
And 
Um 
He would do stuff to basically 
I guess 
Ruin my plans 
Um 
He would specifically walk slow 
Which would slow down the entire group 
Um 
He was out of shape 
But 
He could have definitely done more 
And 
Uh 
Because 
I did not have his support 
That basically ruined a lot of our plans 
And 
He basically 
Um 
I don’t know 
If you want to say sabotaged 

You know 
What we wanted to do 
Um 
Which 
And 
You know you need to give your leader respect as well 
Um 
With all of us being civilians for the most part 
Unless like we’re a part of army reserve or something of the sort 
Um 
You know 
We don’t actually know what’s going on in the world today 
We know what the media tells us 
Um 
Media can definitely be influenced by certain things 
They want to make you think this or think that 
Um 
But 
On the other hand 
Um 
Hmm 
On the other hand 
Um 
You know like 
We don’t actually know what’s going on 
Um 
There’s all these top secret things I’m sure 
Um 
That we can’t know otherwise we’d be scared every day 
You know 
Probably to actually walk outside 
Um 
So 
You know 
I think for that 
Since we don’t actually know what’s going on 
Um 
We think we do but we actually don’t 
Um 
I feel as though we should always back up our President 
And 
Um 
He is doing something for a reason obviously 
And 
If he feels as though we should stay there then I definitely feel as though we should stay there 
Um 
Given 
Um 
I do not even know anybody over in Iraq right now 
I knew somebody 
Um 
That was over there 
My brother’s friend 
Um 
And 
Um 
Well 
Yeah let me just say 
Presently I don’t know anybody over there 
But I do know people that have gone over into the middle east 
Um 
And 
It’s not a good time 
You know 
For the families it’s very hard 
And 
Um 
You know 
I’m sorry about that 
But 
On the other hand 
When people do 
Uh 
Enlist 
They know what they’re getting themselves into 
Um 
They’re volunteering for things such as this 
They should know what to expect 
Um 
They know the risks that are involved 
Uh 
So 
For one thing 
You know 
You don’t 
I’ve never heard 
An um 
An officer or anything complaining about the war 
I’ve only heard about other people complaining about the war 
Um 
But 
Given I’m not very 
Um 
I guess 
Educated in 
You know 
This field as opposed to 
Um 
As compared to other people 
Um 
I don’t go on the internet researching it or anything 
Um 
But 
I’ve never heard anybody other than like regular civilians complaining 
Um 
So 
I don’t know 
If you know 
If the army starts complaining a lot 
And 
Really allows themselves to be heard then I can definitely see us pulling out of 
Um 
The mid east 
But 
Until then I don’t feel as though there’s a problem with the war or anything 
Um 
You know wherever there was good intentions I think that’s all that matters 

Um 
I feel as though it should continue until President Bush 
Uh 
Feels as though 
Um 
It has gone on long enough 
Until our goals have been met 

Nope that’s it
