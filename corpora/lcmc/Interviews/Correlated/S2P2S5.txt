Um 
Um 
Well 
I mean 
I’m not really sure cause 
Uh 
I mean I’ve never personally experienced any gender discrimination 
I’m sure that its out there somewhere 
Um 
Otherwise it wouldn’t be an issue 
But um 
I’d say it’s definitely not a major issue in our society like now a days 
It 
It was obviously a much bigger issue maybe like 50 years ago or 
You know half a century ago 
But I think now a days its not so much 
I mean 
A 
My boss at my job is a women and so is the women above her and 
A 
It seems like my dad works with a lot of women and stuff to so 
I don’t think its that much of an issue 

Um 
Well I don’t really feel like 
A 
Many places discriminate against gender in anyway in the modern society we have today 
I mean especially living in America where there’s like 
You know a whole 
Um 
 I guess they say melting pot or whatever of different ethnicities or whatever 
So 
Um 
I think 
Uh 
I don’t really think it’s that much of an issue here 

Uh 
Men or women? 

Oh 
Um 
I don’t think so 
I mean I’ve never personally experienced any discrimination in the workplace or otherwise just cause of my gender 

Um 
Well 
Um 
I mean I’ve 
I’ve never been 
You know offered a position and then like a women has gotten it over me or anything like that 
Um 
I mean I 
I would say that obviously men and women are different just uh inherently 
Like they say that through studies 
Um 
Men are better at 
I’m not sure what it is 
I think one of the two is better at math kinda stuff 
I think its men 
And women are better at something else 
So 
Um 
I would say like 
Um 
Its not really discrimination if you give like 
Like if you give some kind of math skill job to a man cause if 
If it’s been scientifically proven that 
You know 
Men are better at that kind of stuff then 
I don’t think its that much of an issue 

Uh no
