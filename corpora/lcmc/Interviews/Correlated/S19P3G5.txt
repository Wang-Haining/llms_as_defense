Um 
I was actually raised in a Christian home so like 
Homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me 
Because 
I have a lot of gay friends 
Um 
I think that I don’t necessarily agree with that lifestyle  
But 
I think that it should be legalized 
I don’t think it should be a national issue 
However I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than 
Um 
Like 
The president deciding for the entire country 

Um 
Well like a lot of states are democratic 
And 
A lot of states are republican 
Obviously democratic states are gonna push for gay marriage 
And 
Um 
If you’re living in a democratic state 
Like obviously you know how that state feels about that position 
And 
Um 
I don’t think that you’re necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state does decide to legalize gay marriage 
Because 
Like 
You kind of chose to live there 
You know 
So I 
Like 
I think 
I don’t 
I think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals so 
I feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state 

Well I kind of already answered that 
But 

Um 
Yeah I don’t feel as though 
Um 
Bush should be allowed to 
Um 
Decide 
Um 
Um 
That the whole country should be against gay marriage 
I think that it should be up to the 
Um 
Individual states as to whether they want to legalize it 
I don’t agree with his ban on it 

Um 
I just 
I just don’t think 
Like 
I don’t think that 
Like Bush doesn’t live in every single state 
So 
He shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to run 
Um 
Run itself I guess I don’t know 
Um 
So 
I think that 
Um 
Some things should be left up to 
Um 
Each individual state 
Plus he’s gonna be out of office in like what two years 
And 
If a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage 
Like 
It’s just going to go back and forth 
It should just be up to each individual state 
Because 
They’re the ones that are gonna have to live with that decision 
Not the president 

No I don’t
