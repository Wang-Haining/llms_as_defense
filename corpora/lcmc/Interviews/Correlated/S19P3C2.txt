I think it does yeah 

Oh I think that like the Catholic Church has been around since like the beginning of time almost 
And 
A lot of their traditions are exactly the same as they were before 
And 
I think that with a growing society 
And 
With how much society has changed that it’s time for the Catholic Church to like adapt as well 

Um 
I definitely think it could have prevented that 
Because 
Obviously the priests were like sexually frustrated or something 
And 
Felt they had to express themselves somehow 
And 
Unfortunately it resulted in pedophilia 
And 
I think it definitely could have been avoided if there were female priests or if they were allowed to marry 

Um 
Well like staying celibate is a really hard thing to 
Especially for guys 
Because 
Like their sexual urges are a lot stronger than that for females 
And 
I feel like 
Like god created people to be sexual 
And 
Um 
Denying the priests of that 
Um 
I think 
Is what made them resort to pedophilia 

No
