Uh  
I absolutely think that the Catholic Church needs to change its ways to adapt 
I mean it’s done it before 
Like the Vatican and the Vatican II 
Um 
Councils 
They 
There’s certain laws and certain things that are antiquated and don’t belong in our society anymore.
I mean for one the fact that priests can’t marry 
That was never a religious thing 
It was bought in as a political ploy 
Political, financial ploy 
Um 
When priests 
In the beginning of the Catholic Church priests were marrying and they were having children and then the land on which they had built their church was going to their sons rather than the church 
So the church decided that it would no longer allow priests to marry 

Um 
And frankly, I think that it prohibits them from leading a full life 
It prohibits them from being able to understand what some of their flock may be going through 
So um 
And also I’m speaking from a non-Catholic perspective 
I was raised both Catholic and Lutheran, but I also grew up seeing a priest without a family and a pastor with a family 
And the pastor was able to relate much better to what was going on in the daily lives of his congregation, rather than the priest 
Um 
And then there are other things as well as um 
The use of contraception 
The use 
The allowance of females into the ministry 
Um 
I understand that back in the middle ages women were seen as subversive and underneath and lower than men and much more open to sin thanks to Eve and the Bible, but frankly the Bible did not arrive by facts from heaven 
It was written by man 
So they can’t really say that women are more susceptible because of Eve 
And then also women now today are seen as equal to men 
They are not lesser 
Um and I think that by the church 
By having the church disallow women to be priests I think that it’s only adding to gender discrimination that we have a problem with already 
Um 
And it just 
There are many things about that church that are also 
Trying to go back 
I mean Benedict has also said that he wants mass spoken in Latin again 
And no one speaks Latin these days 

Not conversationally 
So it’s 
It causes problems within the general population in that you’re putting stress on your people to learn something or else they’re not gonna understand 
And then part of it is that even when mass was spoken in Latin 
People didn’t understand 
So why would you want to throw your people back into an era where they’re not understanding what’s going on in your church?
Um 
The church I think needs to move up 
It needs to move up with the times again 
It has before 
I don’t think that the church is infallible like many people seem to think 
Um 
It seems to me that the church is kind of stuck in a rut and can’t escape and 
I mean it didn’t take steps forward when Pope John Paul was Pope, but now that he’s died it seems to be taking 
You know 
Another step back 
So I’m really not sure what to think anymore with the Catholic Church 
Um 
And I know I’m not the only one 
I have a lot of other friends that are Catholic who are questioning their faith because of what the church is doing and the fact that the church isn’t stepping up 
Um 
And I mean to me, the fact that the church is so against gay marriage, and the fact that the church is so against contraceptives 
To me, God is not 
If there is a God, God is not stupid enough to say, no you’re going to hell because of who you love 
Or you’re going to hell because 
You know 
You’re married so you didn’t feel like 
And you didn’t feel like having another child 
Like that’s not the way it works 
I think Christianity is more forgiving 
Or it should be 
Um 
Cause it has that whole turn the other cheek thing 
That’s a nice little addendum 
So 
Sometimes I think the church should actually look at what they’re doing 
And sometimes I think it gets away from them because they are such a large organization that things get away from them 
And they don’t think to look back 
There would probably still be some of it because 
You know who 
Different strokes for different folks 
Not that I say it’s right 
But um 
But I think that most of it could have been 
Yes, I think 
Everyone needs someone to love and needs someone to love them 
Whether they’re a priest or not 
That doesn’t matter 
They’re still human 
I think a lot of people forget that priests are still human 
Uh 
They expect them to be more and better and perfect and they’re not 
They’re gonna make mistakes just like everybody else 
They’re going to 
And I think sometimes having someone there 
With you 
Beside you 
Watching your life and you’re watching them 
I think sometimes it helps you to keep a better grip on what you’re doing 

And keep yourself grounded 
Um 
And I think that if priests are allowed to marry they wouldn’t have gone looking for it in a place other than they already have it 
Um 
Nope.
