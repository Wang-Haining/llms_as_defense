Um 
I think that gay marriage should be legal 
I think that there is 
Um 
Absolutely no reason that people who are gay should not be able to get married 
I think that there 
Um 
If you love someone you’re loving the person you’re in love with 
It doesn’t matter if they are a man or a women 
And I don’t see why you would try and stop that 
Um 
Sure 
I think 
Um 
There are not really very many laws permitting regular marriage in any state 
And 
I mean there are to do with age and things like that 
But I think that it should be equal for all types 
It shouldn’t matter who you’re trying to marry 
I think that it’s wrong of the government to try and control who people love 
And giving 
And making it feel like they’re doing something illegal by loving someone else 
Everyone should just be treated equally 
I don’t think the federal government should be involved any more then there involved in 
Um 
In heterosexual marriages because the only rule we really have is that we can’t get married until were 18 
I think its that’s the law they want to have that’s fine 
But I don’t think there should have any say in what type of marriage you’re having 
And I think that there should not be the constitutional ban on gay marriage 
Sure 
Um 
(Pause)
I don’t think it’s anyone else besides your own right to 
Um 
To say who you fall in love with or who you want to marry 
And I don’t think 
Um 
That anyone should have control over that 
Um 
I 
I just don’t 
I think that’s something that you really can’t control 
And if you 
Um 
Fall in love with someone no one should tell you that that’s wrong 
And I feel like right now that the government is trying to tell you that you’re wrong 
By falling in love with someone whose the same sex as you 
And whereas in a lot of cases 
I mean there 
They haven’t really completely figured it out but scientifically speaking its something that you really can’t control 
So to say that something you can’t control is making you a bad person 
And that’s illegal 
Is wrong
Um 
Well I don’t really know exactly 
But I know that they have been looking in to see if it’s hereditary at all 
Or if 
Um
If that there have been if there are influences in your life that could make you any different 
So I just know that 
Um 
If they 
If that is true 
And if that is something that you can’t control then that makes the constitutional ban even more ridiculous
No
