Um 
I think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century 
Um 
It’s not as strict as it used to be 
I know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday 
And 
I would get cute little dresses 
And 
Matching shoes 
And 
A matching purse 
And 
That was just every all my 
I went to a private school 
And 
I would see all my friends there on the weekends 
And 
We would just go 
But 
Now as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass 
And 
They cut it down to thirty minutes 
And 
People dress a lot more casual 
During summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach 
You’d have the families there that are just running in late 
So I think it has become more casual 
Even at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up 
People are wearing jeans and khakis 
Well khakis are nice too 
But 
Just a lot more causal in respect to that 
As for other things 
That’s the biggest thing that I noticed 
Like 
That’s the church I know 
I don’t know the politics into the church and what not 
But 
Yeah 
That’s it 
[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]
Um 
I don’t think that these things could have been avoided 
Because 
There are men who are married 
And 
They still become pedophiles 
And 
They still have 
Uh 
An attraction towards young kids 
So 
I think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married 
Um 
I think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest 
Um 
There are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be 
Like on Seventh Heaven 
I don’t know what kind of 
He’s a reverend or a minister or something 
[Mm hmm]
But 
They’re allowed to get married 
So 
I know it’s a little different 
But 
If they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith 
[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]
Um 
On which part 
About 
[Um]
Just the changing ways 
[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]
Oh on the pedophilia 
[Mm hmm]
Um 
I think 
Like the whole 
Um 
Sexuality before about being genetics 
I think it’s based on genetics 
I don’t think people 
Um 
Just become it 
I think they’re born that way 
I don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up 
It might have something to do a little more in this case 
But 
I think it’s their genetics 
And 
You can’t hide that through a marriage 
You could try 
But 
Then it would usually come out 
So 
I don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening 
Um 
If they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them 
But 
I don’t think in all cases they knew 
[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]
Um no
