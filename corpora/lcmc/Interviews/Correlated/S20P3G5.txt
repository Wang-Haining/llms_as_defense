Um 
See I don’t 
I don’t feel as though gay marriage should exist through as in an actual marriage 
Um 
Like I had said before 
I am a Roman Catholic 
Um 
I’m not ever going to say that I hate gays 
‘Cause 
I don’t at all I have nothing against them 
I have nothing for them 
Um 
You know that’s none of my business at all what they do in their personal lives 
Um 
Let’s see I’ve 
Hmm 
Um 
With the whole marriage issue 
I don’t feel as though it should be called a marriage 
Um 
I feel as though it should be called a union or something of the sort 
Um 
And 
With that you could legally have 
Um 
Two gay men or two 
Uh 
Lesbian women be together 
Um 
And 
That would be acknowledged 
Uh 
It just would not be acknowledged through the church 
In society today I don’t really feel as though acknowledgement through the church is such a big deal 
Um 
Because 
You know 
There’s no personal beliefs 
It’s not what the country believes in 
You know 
Our country was founded upon Christian beliefs 
Um 
Let’s see here 
I um 
Yeah if if you call a quote unquote you know marriage a union 
Uh 
Between two men or two women 
Um 
The church should not have a problem with that at all 
Um 
George W. Bush I know had recently tried to pass a law or something 
Um 
Banning gay marriages 
Um 
I believe that was a sub question in another part 

Um 
Let’s see I don’t feel as though they should be involved at all 
It is a personal decision 
Um 
But 
On the other hand if you look at the country it was founded upon Christian beliefs 
So 
Therefore 
Um 
I don’t feel as though that’s a problem 
So 
It’s very half and half from my opinion 
Um 
Let me see here 
And 
If you look at the United States 
We obviously have the most freedom of any other country in the world 
Um 
So 
This type of thing 
Like 
In other countries people 
I wouldn’t be surprised if 
You know they 
Um 
They were punished for 
For being gay or something of the sort 
Um 
I’m pretty sure that happens 
But 
You know 
I don’t have any facts to back that up 
Um 
Let me see here 
Like I said 
You know 
I don’t feel as though the government should interfere 
Um 
But 
On the other hand 
With the Christian 
Um 
Basis of the country 
I’m just repeating myself right now 
Um 
Are there any other sub questions 

Um 
Let me see here 
I um 
I don’t know 
Like 
You know 
I’ve definitely met 
Uh 
Gay people in my life and I have nothing against them at all 
Uh 
You know 
I treat them 
You know 
Just like anybody else 
Um 
And 
Hmm 
I don’t know 
I just feel as though 
Um 
It shouldn’t exactly be banned 
Um 
But 
I can see if 
Basically if you change the word to a union or something of the sort then I don’t feel as though there would be any problems with any body in the country 
Um 
Because 
You know 
They have nothing to complain about 
Because 
It’s not an official marriage 
But 
It is something within itself 
So 
I think that would solve basically all the controversy within our country at the time 
Um 
I don’t know 
I’m coming to 
Uh 
Kind of a block here 
So 

No I think that’s it
