Gender discrimination 
Well its tough to say here at Loyola 
We have like a 60%-40% girl to guy ratio and all the better classes are dominated by girls so I guess were 
You know the vice versa here 
But I think in our society today there’s still double standards and and that’s something that’s going to be present forever just because its human nature almost to judge 
But I don’t 
I don’t think it’s nearly as bad as it used to be 
I don’t know and I’m a history major philosophy minor 
I don’t have the uh 
I’m not looking into like an internship where knowing the percentage of each company women to men so I don’t really know 
Too much about this topic but I think its 
Obviously its going to be prevalent as long as there’s opposites as long as there’s differences from sexes and genders 
I’m sorry and uh races and so forth and religions 
There’s going to be 
There’s gonna be discrimination of some sort 

Yeah sure 
I mean its just human nature to to 
Um see something different and then judge that 
Like um if they’re not like you then there is obviously a reason why and you look for it 
And its 
Maybe that’s the worst possible thing to say to describe it as but people 
People walking into a room and they like profile you right away 
It seems to be the way it is 

I don’t know 
I’m not really sure 
I guess 
Um 
I mean I know 
In the sports world women don’t get paid as much when they win a championship as men and so forth but that has a lot to do with the revenue they bring in so I don’t really know if that’s a good example but 
I guess you would have to try to 
I guess you’d have to try to give the exact equal for everything and that way there wouldn’t be any 
There wouldn’t be any discussion 
They get paid as much as we do 
They have as much opportunity 
You know and so forth 

So yeah 

Well yeah sure 
I mean I think there’s a growing percentage of women CEO’s and uh 
Whatever FEO’s what ever they’re called 
You know the top management at big companies 
That percentage is starting to grow real 
Vast and quickly in our society so I think maybe that’s a good start 

But yeah 

Uh no 
I don’t 

Yeah 
I mean the United States being founded on a patriarchal society 
Men have always had the upper hand and advantage and everything from poitics to to the you know police force and the fire companies and everything is still 
There are still predominately male jobs where there are very few predominately female jobs 
In our society 
So I think men have always had the upper hand in maybe the first pick and the first 
You know up until you know how many years ago 
My mom graduated from Penn. Vet School 
She was one of three women to graduate from her 50 person class 
But now veterinarians are a job who are dominated 75-25% by women 
So I think there are some jobs that have started to make progress but it has to start somewhere and at the same time 
You know maybe even 50 years you’ll see more of it but we’re still living in the society where our parents generation was male dominated 

Well I 
We talked about 
I actually had a funny situation 
I was talking last night with one of my friends about how it’s it’s terrible that we have 
Times are arbitrary for our class selection and uh 
My one friend said well what if we did it by GPA 
And like my first response was ehh that would be a pretty good idea then I realized that our school’s got 
Its like 60-40% girls to guys and girls have a better GPA here I think for the most part because 
One reason or another maybe they try harder 
I don’t know maybe they’re just smarter in general 
But in classes older 
The fun classes 
The sweet classes it would be you know mostly girls 
So I think Loyola has a 
I mean obviously I have a couple classes where um 
You know there’s a lot of guys 
Out of 30 people it’s like 12 and like 18 but mostly its mostly like 80-20 in my classes at least girl to guy 
So I think the girls have the 
I guess its 
I don’t know if it’s an advantage or a disadvantage but its its definitely a majority 

Uh no 
Not particularly
