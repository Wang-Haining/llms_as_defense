Um 
Well 
To answer that, I mean I’m not really that big on the whole Myspace thing 
I don’t really know what it’s deal is 
But, from what I’ve seen 
Uh 
When you post something on the page 
I mean it’s free for everyone to see 
So, I mean it’s a lot different from something that would be a little more private like Facebook 
Um 
Now I mean when you’re dealing with issues of privacy 
I mean you really have to look at intent of you know the author of you know the page or just the person whose rights are in question 
Um 
You just have to look at the intent behind what they’re doing 
Um 
I feel like if you post something on a Myspace page that everyone can see 
Um 
You’re not really trying to hide anything 
You’re really not 
I mean you’re putting yourself right out there in the open 
I mean it’s like walking you know in the middle of the street yelling that you’re going to kill some students, some fellow classmates at your school 
Um 
I mean it comes back down to like the basic issue of privacy which is like 
I mean your thoughts which is like the most private thing that you can have 
Um 
And just like 
Just like vocalizing those thoughts 
Um 
I mean thousands of thoughts run through our heads each day 
Um 
And a lot of them we probably don’t want to share with other people 
I’m sure everyone’s had weird thoughts that probably freak other people out if they just said them 
Um 
And just 
I mean just that whole 
Just using that as like a basis for like 
Just to explain like the difference between 
Um 
You know intent to keep something in private and to make something public 
I mean you can relate that to everything else 
All these other issues of privacy 
Um 
Certainly if you have thoughts that you want to write down and you like write them in I don’t know like a journal and leave them in your house cause you don’t want anyone to see them 
You know anyone reading that is obviously invading your privacy 
Um 
If you write it up in an email and send it to everyone you know then 
I don’t know 
I mean that seems like it’s really basic obviously 
But, I’m just trying to get at like the basic 
You know what is privacy 
And like what it means to 
Um 
Invade that 
Um 
Well I mean certainly the first thing that 
Um 
You have to look at is 
Um 
Like whether or not there’s any suspicion involved 
Like I mean certainly the police can’t enter your house without a warrant 
Or like you letting them enter 
But um 
They can’t search your house without a warrant 
Um 
I mean they can’t just 
Uh 
Hold on, I’m kind of blanking for a minute 
Um 
Uh just like 
Totally forgot what I was saying 
Sure 
Ok 
Um 
I mean just 
Just certain cases that have been 
Uh 
Like important landmark cases in the past 
Uh 
Like years 
Um 
One of them was where they just had random like urine tests or something on certain football players and they found traces of illicit substances 
Um 
And like all the 
All those students got kicked off the team, expelled whatever 
Um 
I think they appealed and what happened is there was 
Uh 
It was considered not an invasion of privacy 
Um 
I think like on that level 
Um 
When you like sign up to do something 
Um 
And you make a promise not to do certain things 
Um 
I mean then you’re kind of giving up your privacy rights in like order for them to insure that what you’re doing is 
That you’re following all the rules or whatever 
But, if it’s something like unrelated to 
Um 
I guess your activities in school 
Then they really have no right to 
Um 
I guess just look at what you’re doing outside of school 
Um 
I know recently here at Loyola 
Um 
Some people were having an off campus party and 
Um 
Loyola cops and actually Father Lemain actually came to the apartment and 
Um 
Like they all got in trouble and they’re probably all going to get kicked out of school 
Um 
I mean like they were minors at the house and they were serving alcohol too and all that 
Um 
Which is certainly 
I mean I feel like that’s definitely an invasion of privacy 
Um 
Especially just since 
Um 
I mean Loyola doesn’t really have jurisdiction over what you do outside of school 
I mean if the Baltimore County cops or Baltimore City cops were the ones that came to their apartment 
I mean that’s their jurisdiction 
But, I mean it’s something that’s not related to school 
Then I feel like that’s a complete invasion of privacy 
Um 
Not really I’m just kind of 
This topic just kinda 
I don’t know 
I can’t really talk about it 
I don’t really know why 
I’m just blanking
