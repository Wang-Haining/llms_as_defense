Um 
The war in Iraq 
I think that 
Um 
That we are over there 
We are doing very good things over there 
Like I like that we 
Um 
That were trying to get the people there who deserve to have a better life to have a better life 
And I think that there’s a lot of controversy about us staying there right now 

But I think that it’s important that were there because without us there it could go back to how it was 

Um-huh 

Sure 
Um 
I think that it’s important the way when they just had elections a couple of months ago 
And I think it’s important that they get to set up the kind of government that they would want cause they have been controlled for so long 

I think it’s important that they are going to be able to get opportunities closer to what we have cause that seems to be what they have wanted 
They wanted a democracy 
So it’s 
I think that it’s important that we stay over there to be able to 
Um 
Get them what they need 

I think it should continue 
I think it would be dangerous if we took them out now 

Um 
I think if we took them out now there is a chance that the 
Um 
Groups 
I mean I know we’ve tried to control most of the bad groups that were controlling them 
But if we took our troops out now 
Um 
The groups have a chance of getting back in control 

Um 
Sure 
I think 
Um 
We should stay there because it’s important that we get them 
Eh 
Um 
The best things that we can 
And I don’t think we’ve completely done 
Uh trying to get them what they need 

No
