Um 
I think the Catholic Church needs to change its ways in order to provide 
Uh 
Current and effective solutions to social problems 
Uh sure 
I mean I think that uh 
One of the functions of the Catholic Church that has always appealed most to me and one that I always viewed as the most meritous has been 
Uh 
The Catholic Church’s tackling of social problems that states and governments might not have the funds or the personnel 
Uh 
To tackle 
And um 
They did a very good job of that under Pope John Paul II in terms of expanding their scope as an organization 
But I think that you know the world is changing and there are a lot of 
A lot of ills that are going on in a whole variety of ways and I think that while they could be tackling humanitarian issues in Africa and Latin America 
Um 
I think at least the American Catholic Church in tackling issues like stem cell research and gay marriage is just plain selfish and short-sighted 
And they need to kind of change and adapt 
And uh 
I mean cause there’s a lot more in the Bible about being good to your brothers and sisters than there is about you know gay marriage and eating shell fish 
So yeah 
Um 
Well I mean 
I don’t know 
I guess that’s just the same as the kind of division between being liberal in a particular religion and being conservative in a particular religion 
Whether or not you want to try and hang on to the ways of old 
Whether you think it’s ok to 
Uh kind of expand or change a little bit 
Cause some people 
I mean you know you can read the Bible and interpret in any one of a number of ways 
And um 
I mean people then apply their interpretations differently 
I think it’s 
The most foolish thing to do is to fight over it 
Um 
Which I see a lot of people doing cause that’s just counterproductive 
Um 
In terms of specific ways 
Um 
Uh 
I took a theology and politics in America course last semester and I really wish I had all of my notes in front of me right now 
Um 
So I can’t think of any off the top of my head 
They might come to me in a couple of minutes 
Um 
Well I 
I think there are a whole lot of people who go to church on 
You know 
On Sundays 
Um 
And then aren’t even really necessarily sure why 
They just go because they felt like it was the right thing 
That’s where the whole term cafeteria Catholics comes from 
Um 
And I think the Catholic Church might have lost touch with a lot of people in a very real way cause a lot of people in America are struggling over 
You know 
How to get enough food and how to pay their rent and for a lot of those people faith is a very strong component in their lives 
But I mean for a lot of the other people who go to church 
I feel like they’ve kind of lost touch 
Um 
And 
I feel like a lot of the kind of stuff that the church does in developing countries 
I mean a lot of the organizations are good just in terms of what they do to alleviate material poverty 
But a lot of those organizations 
Any of those organizations are only as intact as the actual people that are running them 
And I’ve worked for some where they were great and they were really providing sustainable solutions or problems in helping people 
And I’ve worked for some where the staff and the personnel of that particular organization was just pocketing things and then saying, oh you should give us money because we’re the church 
And then just going and buying cars with it 
So I think in terms of the Catholic Church’s reach 
You know 
Outside of the western world or the quote unquote first world or developed whatever 
Um 
I think that they could maybe clean it up a little bit 
But the fact that they’re there and no one else is in a lot of places is good though 
I 
I 
I think a lot of those things 
I mean I’m not a psychology expert 
But I think that a lot of those things 
Maybe if they would have not happened all together would have happened a lot less frequently if you were to allow people to kind of naturally express their sexual tendencies 
Um 
I mean 
I don’t know 
Celibacy is certainly not for me 
But uh 
I mean I don’t know 
Maybe it’s possible that when you ask people to be celibate 
I don’t know it just does something in their mind or something 
Um 
I mean women in the priesthood wouldn’t be a bad a idea 
I mean a lot of other faiths have no problem with it 
And um 
None of them have really been smitten to hell 
So I guess it’s all about how concrete people are about their particular beliefs 
And what they are 
On which part of the answer? 
Um 
I mean it happens 
I guess I would anticipate that a lot of celibate people might be sexually frustrated 
Um 
And maybe that’s just like a crazy outlet in one way or another 
Um 
I think uh 
It’s too bad that that happened 
But uh 
I think it kinda puts things in perspective in terms of 
I think it kinda knocked the church off its holy high horse a little bit to the point where it’s not as easy for clergy to stand up and say that the church is perfect anymore because you can point to these tangible downfalls and mistakes and things that are far from holy 
Um 
I mean I don’t know 
I’m not really a fan of the Catholic Church 
I’ve never really been a Catholic 
I think uh 
When you prescribe yourself to any particular religion like that or any particular doctrine you end up being too close-minded to see the whole picture in a lot of areas 
So I’m really not an expert on this type of stuff 
Um 
Yeah I’m never gonna be Catholic 
But I’m also never going to hate on anyone else for being Catholic 
But you know I’m certainly never going to force my kids to grow up Catholic or anything like that 
Uh no 
That’s it
