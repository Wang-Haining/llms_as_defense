Well 
My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it 
They decriminalized it 
Um 
Which knocked it down from a criminal offense to 
Uh 
A 
To more of like a traffic ticket 
You know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that 
Um 
And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that 
Um 
Those types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would 
I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well 
Depending on the charge 
At least for a marijuana charge 
One thing that a lot of kids worry about 
A lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized 
But at the same time there is an argument that uh 
I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them 
And to house them and then to let them go 
And then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times 
And then appoint a public defender 
And then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges 
I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do 
And um 
I mean so 
When you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble 
I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession 
Even if it would free up a lot of money for then 
Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that 
But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open 
I have to use the word liberal 
But you know what I mean 
Kind of uh 
Kind of thought track 
Then I think it’s totally fine 
And I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education 
That they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on 
You know food programs for the homeless people 
Um 
I mean so 
I think it’s 
It’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere 
All over the streets and stuff 
Um 
I mean for a variety of reasons 
But there’s this whole like financial element to it as well 
Other reasons like? 
Why it shouldn’t necessarily 
Well no 
I mean I 
I don’t know how I would feel about 
Well because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere 
Then I mean 
I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving 
And um 
It still is like taboo in our society 
In a lot of places and a lot of contexts 
Uh 
To smoke marijuana 
So 
To have it out in the open like that 
I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people 
Um 
And 
Sorry what? 
The volume on the microphone is kind of low 
Um 
I don’t really know 
Um 
I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills 
Um 
But I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle 
As opposed to just their decision making motor skills 
I mean 
But they 
They both have their adverse effects 
And I mean they 
I feel like when it comes to substances in general 
Like no two people really react the same way 
I mean and then people 
Some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have 
And then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t 
So it 
I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance 
When people react different ways 
But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects 
Um yeah 
Uh 
No I don’t
