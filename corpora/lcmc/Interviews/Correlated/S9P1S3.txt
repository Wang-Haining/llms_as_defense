Ok
Gender discrimination
Um
Well I remember when
When I was younger and 
My
Um
You know people always ask kids who they want to be when they grow up 
I remember my dad would always tell me
Don’t don’t be an engineer 
Because there’s so few women engineers
And even if you were in higher ranking positions of authority 

And so 
And so that makes me think that
Well that and among other things that gender discrimination is still a problem in
In the country today
And 
And I think I believe
I think I’ve read statistics where women’s salaries are still not equal to men’s salaries for the same positions 
And 
Um
And uh and
Also there a lot of fields were 
Yes men 
Are are are 
Uh
Dominating 
Like like engineering

And so but
And then
So there’s so there’s gender discrimination against women I still feel today 
But then
I actually also believe that there’s 
Because for so long we’ve been fighting for equal equal rights for women that there’s 
Kind of been a backlash against 
Against men
And so
Ur
I was I was reading 
I was reading this 
I read some articles about education 
And it seems like we’ll saying in the in the past a lot of times boys were favored over girls in the in the classroom
Boys were called on more 
Girls
Uh
Boys were 
Um 
When they were right were reinforced more 
And er 
Or when 
Um
Or when the girls were wrong it was immediately was 
O its ok
Because you don’t have to be as smart as the boys
But that
Today there 
Um
Today 
Girls are more focused on in education and given more attention and that classes are geared more towards girls and their style and the style of learning that they respond to best 

Which I though was really interesting 
And with
And with 
Um
And I and and I think back to my own experience going through school 
And I think that it was girls who were at the near the top of the classes
I mean I’m going back to like grade school
And the boys were the goof balls or or 
Um
Or belittled sometimes by the by the teachers 
Uh
And
And um 
And so I think that
And so 
So there 
And then even once you get into higher education mostly the national average for college is 
Especially at this college 
Especially there’s 
It’s 60% women and 40% men 

And so more 
More women are going to college and receiving higher education then then men these days 
And so 
Oh so 
And so there’s some gender discrimination there and I guess what’s needed is more 
Is just an awareness by teachers especially from a young younger age of how there conducting their classes and making sure that they’re giving an equal opportunity to everyone and that they’re encouraging everyone 
Equally 

And 
And then as well as 
As well as through high school too 
And then 
And then going back to the workforce and gender discrimination against women 
Um 
Well I guess it’s it’s also a case of encouraging women like throughout higher education to to explore areas typically identified with men such as science or engineering or things like that 
And then 
And then there’s 
I don’t know there’s just a need for 
How how do you get people to 
Um 
Uh 
To just 
Um 
Res 
Hold on 
What was I going to say 
I mean it’s hard because you’re just you’re just always you’re always gonna have 
People always have biases and so so 
And sometimes it’s just hard 
You don’t really know how you’re going to get them to understand that their biases are unmerited and 
But I’m trying to think if there’s any other areas of gender discrimination 

Um 
Actually we were talking about this in my 
In one of my classes the other day 
We were talking about the media and 
Um 
And popular culture and someone brought up the point that they feel that men are are 
Well they’re kinda discriminated against in a sense that they’re portrayed only a certain way on many popular television shows that is as as kind of  the goofball and the idiot and the stupid or the stupid husband who always has that um 
The women always has to keep in check and 

And and which kind of goes back to the way that I think that more boys are behaving when they’re younger 
Throughout grade school 
Um 
And so 
So I think there’s a discrimination in the 
In the images presented by the media but then there’s also discrimination presented in 
Or apparent in the 
In images of women in the media 
Um 
I mean if you’re 
That women should be 
Look a certain way and 
Um 
Like 
And 
Um 
I guess one example would be like everyone you see 
You see models everywhere and and all these images who are not representative of the average women so you you kinda get a a biased that this should be what women look like when it’s really not true 
It’s really not representative of the 
Representative of the normal average women 
Um 
I’m trying to think if 
Let’s see 
Discrimination of men in the workplace 
Um 
I still think that men hold the upper hand in a lot in a lot of the 
Um 
In a lot of careers I think 

And then its still women who are who are at a disadvantage 
But 

Yeah 
I’m trying 
Yeah I know 
I’m trying to think cause I 
Probably a generalization that I not informed enough or qualified enough to make but from 

Yeah 
From 
Um 
Well engineering definitely 
Um 
I wonder I wonder what it’s like in the military for women 
There’s a 
There’s a 
One of the girls from my graduating high school class went to West Point 
She’s at West Point 

Yeah so 
I wonder what that’s like 

Like I would have to imagine that there’s probably some sort of bias or discrimination considering just the small amount of women that are 

That are in that 
Um 
That field that career 
Um 
And other careers 
Um 
Hmm 

Um 
Let’s see 
I don’t think I can think of anything else 

Ok
