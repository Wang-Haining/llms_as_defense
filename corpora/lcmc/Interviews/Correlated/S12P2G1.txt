Um 
I believe that the side that is wrong is those who are opposed to it 

I think it is anybody’s right to conduct themselves in whatever relationship they want to 
I mean this is a country born on democracy and liberty and freedom 
And 
I think people should have that sort of choice 
And 
The states that maybe are trying to ban 
Um 
Gay marriage or make it not legal are somehow mixing government politics with religion 

Which is 
I feel is completely wrong 
And 
Unjustified especially in this country where you have so many different religions represented in the United States it’s pretty hard to choose one such as Christianity 
And 
Pick a fundamental belief 
And 
Base political law off of it so 
I think just it’s wrong in that sense if they were mixing politics and religion 
And 
Even if it’s not a matter of religion they’re just doing it out of what they think is some moral law I still think that’s completely wrong 
Because 
Who’s to say that they’re relationship is any different 
Or 
Any more wrong than anybody else’s 
Um 
Additionally I think there’s been scientific studies conducted in recent years 
If you are homosexual you’re actually born with that tendency 
It’s part of your DNA or genealogical structure so 
Again to create something 
To make something illegal that is so natural of humans seems wrong 

Um 
I don’t think the federal government should be involved in it 
Again because I think it’s not so much not so much something that should be protected by law 
But 
More individual choice and liberty 
I think if a government were to get into it only for the purpose of legalizing it and stating that it is such it should be the state government 
Something if the federal government were to get involved in it it’s something much more final 
Especially when it’s an amendment in the constitution 
And 
I think that would demoralize everything the constitution stood for because that’s been a pretty good basis lasting two hundred almost coming up on three hundred years 
And 
It would just demoralize everything it stood for 

About how it would demoralize the constitution 

Um 
I mean ‘cause it seems as though everything else in the constitution has stood up for this long and it’s been well respected 
And 
Copied for copied and looked up upon several different cultures around the world 
So 
To introduce something like that where it’s not so much protecting the society as more infringing upon individual rights 
And 
Their relationships I think it will just 
It will really stick out in the constitution as being something that’s not very lawful 
And 
Certainly be debated for years to come whereas the rest has been pretty much set in stone and accepted our society accepts it as lawful 

Yeah I mean I think gay marriage and going into families with homosexual parents 
I mean again who’s to say that they are any more or less loving of their children 
Who’s to say 
I mean just ‘cause the physical make up of their family is any different doesn’t mean that they’re children or society should look at that family any different 
They can still grow up and grow as a family with the same values 
And 
I mean 
A relationship is 
Especially something like marriage or courtship is based on love and how you feel about somebody else 
So 
To you know try and put law on a relationship and say that you can’t 
There are restrictions on how you your natural instincts and how you should feel about somebody else 
I just think that’s completely wrong 

Um 
I think that’s it
