Frankly to me it seems like the same thing as alcohol 
It’s basically giving you the same effects 
Um 
Personally I don’t do either so it’s one of those things where yay 
Completely, completely hypothetical decision 
Um 
But, most people who use it are smart about it 
It’s just like 
I think it may give people a way to actually regulate what’s going on with it rather than what we have now which is basically a free-for-all 
You know 
People can get as much as they want 
Do as much as they want 
Um 
But like I said it goes back 
It’s the same thing as alcohol 
As long as you’re smart about it 
If you’re not using it and you’re not overdoing it 
It’s one of those 
I mean alcohol is considered a drug as well 
It’s one of those drugs that I think can be used for social and relaxation purposes without overdoing it 
Yes, you’ll still have the people who will overdo it, but that’s something that’s going to happen no matter what 
Whether you regulate it or not 
And if it’s regulated you’ll probably have a better chance of helping those people who do have problems because then we can put programs in place to help them 
Just like we have alcoholics anonymous and we have other programs such as that 
We really can’t have that now because it seems really aiding and abetting crime 
Um 
And also it also does 
There are some ways where it’s very good for use in medicinal ways 
And there’s still states that don’t even have that 
Um 
It seems to make sense to me that the two drugs alcohol and marijuana are very similar so why wouldn’t you have 
Why would you have one rule for one and one rule for the other?
Um 
And then the argument that people say marijuana is a gateway drug 
I disagree with that 
I think that anything can be a gateway drug whether it be prescription medication, whether it be alcohol, whether it be marijuana, whether it be a regular cigarette 
If you’re going to be open to doing something 
You’re going to be open to it whether or not you’ve used something else 
Um 
Hmm 
Um 
I think that negatively yes you have may have some people who overdo it, but we already have that 
So then there’s the positive of being able to help them 
Um 
Also if we’re selling it ourselves, we’re able to regulate it and it wouldn’t 
Like a lot of times nowadays marijuana is sold cut with other things 
PCP, LSD, angel dust, etcetera, etcetera 
It makes it so much more dangerous and someone thinks they’re just smoking pot and they’re getting this whole myriad of drugs from this and that’s how it becomes a gateway 
That’s how it becomes more 
Um 
And if it was legalized it’s going to be clean, it’s going to be pure 
And then also you can see 
There’s probably a way of how to keep track of who’s buying how much 
Um 
I’m sure there’d be some sort of database following that 
At least in the beginning 
So tracking down people who have a problem would be easier 
Um 
Depends on the person 
It is different for the person 
But, same with alcohol 
Some people are going to get very effected by it 
Some people are going to be not very effected by it 
And then with 
What happens 
It’s not a depressant, but basically it kind of just can calm you down if you’re just using it in a small bit 
I mean it’s having a few puffs of a joint is probably equivalent to having a beer after work 
It’s just a way to kind of wind down for some people 
Um 
And the effects to me is sometimes with marijuana 
I mean I see so many people here on campus drinking themselves to death and I’ve seen people who smoke pot recreationally and it seems to be a lesser evil than alcohol 
I mean sometimes to me alcohol is more dangerous than marijuana 
Um 
Not that I can really think of
