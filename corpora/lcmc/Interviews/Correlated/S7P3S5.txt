Um 
I think that it is a still an issue 
But not as serious as it was like back when women were only supposed to take care of the home and then men went out and made money 
Like it’s not that serious as it is now 
But I feel like sometimes it’s kinda switched around like 
Um men are 
Like I know men today are discriminated because if they want to do any 
Like any um 
Jobs that don’t have a lot of authority 
Like they can’t 
Um 
It’s looked down upon if they want to become a secretary 
Or if they want to become assistant to someone above them 
Or if they want to a housewife or a house dad I guess you call it now  
If they want to become something like that 
They’re looked down upon 
Whereas women are still 
I feel like women are kinda 
People are kinda rooting for women now 
You know 
They’re like try and get better 
Like be bigger and better than just someone with an assistant 
Like I know I want to be a nurse practitioner and people are telling me like why do you want to be a nurse practitioner 
Why can’t you be 
Like why don’t you want to be a doctor? 
And my reasons are because I want a family 
And like if you’re a nurse practitioner you can have a family and still have a job and still 
Like you still get both benefits 
And being a nurse practitioner you’re basically a doctor 
Just without the title 
And I’m Ok with that 
But I think for a man 
Like they can’t be Ok with that 
You know they 
And I think like also like it’s just 
It’s just hard because if you look at all the authority figures in the world like men are presidents 
They think that 
You know look at Jesus 
Jesus was a man 
God’s a man 
They think God’s a man 
So it’s like all the major big roles are of men 
So even if like I think that men are kinda just set to just 
To always want to be an authority because every big major political, religious thing is always a man 
Even I mean even in the business world 
Although, yes, there are some women 
It’s still predominantly dominated by women 
I mean by men 
So I think the only 
I mean I think the only way you can really change it is to change the mindset 
And that is gonna come with like years 
Cause I mean it’s not as bad as it used to be 
But it’s 
I think like more so with our generation 
We’re more like not pushing women and men 
Like we’re pushing like 
Like boys and girls to be as good as they want to be 
If they don’t want to be like 
You know 
The head of some big company 
That’s Ok 
You know 
It’s more 
I think the only way to really change that is to change the mindset 
And that is as people are becoming 
As generations have become or whatever 
They become more like not about power, power, power 
But kinda doing what you want to do 
And I think that our generation and when we have our kids 
We’re gonna be even better at it 
And we’re gonna be like you know what 
Do whatever you want to do 
If you don’t want to be like some big power head 
You don’t have to be some big power head 
Cause look at why like being a big power head 
Like you don’t really you know 
Get a family 
You’re always traveling and doing this, this and this 
That you like 
It’s always like these big compromises of being a big power head 
So now it’s like it’s Ok that you don’t have to 
That you don’t want to be that 
And I think like I said it’s just more of a mindset that as you go 
You know things change and my situation changes and generations come and things will get a little bit different 
Yeah 
I think I mean it’s not like a huge discrim- 
It’s more like 
Um 
Like there’s not 
Like they’re looked at differently 
It’s not more so like well 
I think that people will still hire a man if he wanted to be a nurse regardless of whether he’s a man or not 
But I think it’s just like 
It’s like 
I don’t 
Uh 
What’s the word for it? 
Like 
Um 
Like it’s like that not spoken discrimination 
Like people are gonna say you know all this 
Um 
Like why do you want to be that or whatever 
But 
They’re gonna look at you 
They’re just gonna look at you differently 
Like why do you want to be a nurse? 
Like they’re gonna say it in their head 
But they’re not gonna come out and be like 
You know 
Why do you want to do that?
You know and like people aren’t gonna be like 
And because they have all these laws and what not against gender discrimination 
So you can’t do it 
Even though people will find a way 
But you still 
Get like um 
Like um 
Legally like you cannot discriminate against men or against women 
But I think it’s more of like 
I guess like an internal like discrimination 
No
