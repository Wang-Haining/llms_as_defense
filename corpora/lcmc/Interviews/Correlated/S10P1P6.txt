Um 
Well I think that’s kind of extemporating circumstances where they prevented a school shooting but in general I think that 
I don’t like the whole being able 
The 
The 
Oh well I guess like uh 
The Athletic director in our school here 
I play tennis here 
He checks out all the people’s Facebook pictures 

Yeah 
Yeah 
Its 
Yeah I mean he has his own account under some under a college kids name 

Uh 
Its 
I don’t really know if there is a reason 
I think it’s to make sure you know that 
They don’t wanna see us doing things we’re not supposed to as we’re here 
Some people are here on the schools money and they want to make sure that they’re investments are 
You know acting properly but at the same time its just ridiculous that they 
They would even look for that 
You know what 
5 years ago 
2 years ago would they have been able to do that no 

So why do it now 
Uh 
Although I think there are 
I think Myspace is a little bit of a 
It’s become more of a globally known spot for like 
You know really creepy people and and with the whole school shooting thing they stopped 
It’s probably 
It’s a good thing I suppose that they were able to check it and see 
But its kinda stupid the kid put it up there I suppose 
I mean I guess if you 
It’s a shame you have to censor what you put in your own private things because people are gonna be looking but 
Um 
At the same time I guess 
I don’t know 
For us we just have to be careful about the pictures we put up and the things we say 

Yeah 
I don’t know 
To be honest I don’t 
I’ve never 
I don’t have a Myspace account 
I don’t I’ve never 
I don’t even know people that do around here 
It’s kind of you know Facebook in college and so forth 
But um 
I 
Yeah I heard of um 
Oh Myspace’s originally just because it was a stalker network or something you know 
That’s like the original tone from it so it kinda hit me the wrong way from the beginning 
But uh 
I’m all for these things I think they have there 
There um there proper usages and they have there downfalls as well 
Everybody knows everything about everybody now 

Which is kinda 
It takes away the whole human interaction when you meet somebody for the first time 
But you already know like what their favorite movie is 
Exactly so 
You know I’m 
I think they’re good on the whole 
I think they are positive thing 
But I think if taken by like administrators as a way to to 
To follow up on people and to make sure 
If I’m on probation for drinking or smoking or something like that and my an administrator sees me drinking in a picture I can get kicked outta school 

I don’t know how I feel about that 

Um 
Hm 
You know I’d say if they 
I think invasion of privacy starts with the you know the first out of context like 
Um 
I guess out of school context 
Um 
Like 
If per say they see you um getting out of a Loyola College police cop car or something and you know just belligerent or something 
Then obviously that’s in their relm or jurisdiction but 
Um 
I think you know ex post facto things when it happened or whatever 
You know a week and a half ago or two months ago and they can see a picture of it and you can get in trouble for it 
I think that’s kinda of ridiculous 

So I guess that’d be the line I guess 

Yeah sure 
Sure 

Yeah 
I’d say like bomb threats and like 
You can never be too safe with things of that nature 
You don’t wanna have to 
You don’t wanna be the one that said like yeah I knew it was going to happen but we didn’t do anything about it and it did 
Like you know 
Like with 911 per say 

If that’s true 
Yeah better safe the sorry but at the same time realistic is nice to 

Uh no
