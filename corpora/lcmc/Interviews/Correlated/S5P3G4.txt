Um 
I think the states opposing gay marriage are wrong 
Um 
I think that they should be open to gay marriage 
Because 
Everyone at this time in 
At this I guess at this point in time 
That came out very bad 
But 
Um 
I think things have changed 
And 
People have changed 
And 
Gay marriage should be accepted 
Because 
There are so many people that now have come out about their sexuality 
And 
The fact that they’re able to come out of their 
Out to say that they are gay or whatever you want to call it 
Um 
I think that they should be allowed to get married 
I think that 
Um 
It takes a lot of guts to be able to say you are that way 
Especially with a lot of people who 
Um 
Do not believe in it 
And 
Believe that it’s a disease or whatnot 
But 
I think that it’s just some people are born that way 
And 
You can’t change the way you’re born 
And 
They should be allowed to get married 

Um 
Well in my psychology class we 
Um 
Touched a little bit on this 
And 
The book or basically what we decided in class 
What my professor spoke about was that it is something genetic 
And 
That just however it matches up 
Like 
I don’t know how you could say that I’m attracted to men but then other people are attracted to the same sex 
Um 
Just based on genetic testing 
And 
Reasoning 
Like 
It doesn’t matter 
Some people feel that the way that you grow up 
Or the way you’re brought up 
Um 
The toys you’re given or something like has an effect 
But 
I don’t think that has any effect on a person for 
In this case 
Like 
If it doesn’t define who you’re going to 
What sex you’re going to end up liking 
And 
Then I know in another one of my classes 
Um 
We were reading something by Plato 
And 
He even from way back then he even said that humans were created in three forms 
And 
Each form 
There was one form that had two female genitals two male genitals 
And 
Then another form that had a male and a female 
And 
The gods split them in half saying that 
Because 
They didn’t want humans to get too powerful 
So they were split in half 
And 
Then he reasoned that this was 
Um 
Love is those cut in half pieces searching for their soul mate 
So that just made me think like 
This has been around for so long and we’re still having issues about it 
So 
That’s why I think that it should be legal 

For them to get married 

Um 
No I don’t think the federal government should be involved in the issue 
Because 
I don’t think it’s a federal issue really 
I think it’s 
Um 
The states 
I think it’s more of a people’s choice if they want this to happen it should be 
Um 
I think there’s much greater things going on that they should be focusing on rather than the legalization of gay marriage 

Um 
Let me see what’s going on in the world 
Um 
Well I think that they should be dealing with issues like the war in Iraq 
Like 
Terrorism 
Um 
They should be 
I’m trying to think of other 
Not issues so much that they’re not a part of 
Like 
It’s not federal 
Like 
President Bush he’s not one of those people 
He’s not gay 
He doesn’t like men 
So I don’t think that he should be trying to make an amendment when he has no idea how that person feels 
I don’t think when they are not 
When they didn’t 
When they’re not like in that 
Where they don’t have any first hand experience in it 
I don’t think they should be dealing with it 

No I do not
