Um 
That’s a very open ended question 
I mean 
It’s hard for me to say whether I’m against or for the war 100% 
Because 
There’s a lot of gray area of information I don’t know 
And 
I think I never will know about why we went in 
Or 
Whether it was justified 
But 
I do believe that the major public did kind of get 
Didn’t really know what was going on 
Because 
After post nine eleven it was kind of universally agreed that we needed to go to Afghanistan 
And 
It kind of just blurred 
As far as the media 
The American media was concerned 
Into the war in Iraq 
And 
There was really never any solidified conclusion to Afghanistan 
So 
People just thought 
Oh why are we in Iraq oh nine eleven 
And 
They just went back 
And 
That was their mindset about going into Iraq 
And 
Now it’s with no end in sight 
It’s starting to 
We need to start thinking about whether 
If we’re in there for any much longer than we are right now that’d be 
Um 
Would start becoming more of a bad thing 
More of a negative thing than it is a positive thing to change 

Um 
Yes 
Um 
We’re going there to like 
I really don’t even know why we’re in there any more 
But 
All I know is that kids my age are dying over there 
And 
That’s never a good thing 

Um 
I really have no 
I really can’t say either way 

Well it’s 
I’m still 
It’s an ongoing conflict 
And 
In the future 
If things if the events that are happening right now continue to go on 
Like if more people start dying 
And 
It’s not 
We’re not making much more of a positive change in Iraq then we should pull out 
That’s the closest thing I could get to an answer 

Uh 
No
