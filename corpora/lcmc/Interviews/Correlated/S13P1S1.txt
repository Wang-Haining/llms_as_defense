Ok I
I definitely feel that it’s
That’s it’s an issue
That’s still present
Um
Hum
I’m not exactly sure what we would do to change it
But
In terms of
I definitely think that’s it’s
That it exist in the workplace

Um
Especially
Uh
Like in terms of the whole idea of the glass ceiling
And um
You know
That women tend to make less than men

For doing the exact same job 
And it seems that
Especially since there’s also the issue of
Women who possibly are going out on maternity leave
And 
I mean
That I can see
From some stand point 
I can see that because if there were two people that were equally qualified 
But you know
The women is pregnant 
I can see a company wanting to hire the male
But if 
If she’s not pregnant at the time 
And then they just pick the male 
I mean you read about 
The studies of people who
You know men and women who are in the exact same job and the men are making significantly more 
Then that’s
That’s really not fair

Um
And re um also even besides salary 
I think sometimes just around your peers that 
That you know
Maybe they’ll go to the male because he just might know more 
You know

But a women might know equally as much on whatever the issue is 

Um
I think that’s just a general stereotype
You know
They think that men are smarter than women 
Especially with math and science
You tend to associate that with males

Hum
Uh
Not exactly
I mean 
I 
Um 
I just 
When I was just standing outside before
I saw this poster talking about women in the math and sciences 
And I guess awareness would be one issue
In terms of relieving the stereotype 
But in terms of actually guaranteeing that women and men would both receive the same salary when they are performing the exact same job

I guess 
I mean that’s really in the hands of the employer 
And there’s not
I don’t see an exact way to 
To fix that

Um
Hum
I guess if there’s
I mean if
I don’t know about
The 
The workplace
But you tend to think 
Another stereotype
You would think that
You know 
That men wouldn’t be as good at 
All of the
Like they wouldn’t have as many domestic skills

Uh
But
I think 
So 
Yeah
So yeah I guess there are certain things 
In terms of like raising children you tend to think of 
You know
Women as being more caring
And motherly 
In terms of that
But 
Uh odiously motherly because 
She’s the mother
But 
Um
Also
Another
I can think of another 
Example where I think that women would be discriminated against

In terms of
Like women in the military
Or 
Um
In like the police force 
That sort of thing
And there
I
I can actually
It doesn’t bother me as much
Because 
I mean 
You do
I mean
I wouldn’t say that it’s like a stereotype to say
That men are generally stronger than women
Like that’s a natural 
Like fact
They’re just
Were just built differently
So 
When you’re talking about 
Like a job that requires a lot of 
Of physical demand
Not that women aren’t capable of it
But generally men are more qualified to do that 
So 

So I would say that 
That would bother me less than 
Um
Like discrimination in other fields

I think that’s pretty good
