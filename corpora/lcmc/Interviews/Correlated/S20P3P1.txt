Um 
No I don’t at all 
Um 
Let’s see I 
The way I figure it 
Myspace is a public thing 
And 
A bulletin 
You know 
If you look at that definition 
Um 
Then 
You know 
That’s basically to post for the public to see 
Or others to see 
Um 
Whatever you’re trying to get at 
And 
Now if you post that on the internet 
Um 
You know 
You have to realize that people will be seeing that 
Whether it be school officials or not 
Um 
So in my opinion I feel as though the school officials seeing that 
They had every right to see it 
Because 
Even if they weren’t doing it underneath the school’s name 
They could have still accessed that 
Uh 
Through their homes 
Um 
But uh 
Yeah with something preventing a school shooting 
You know 
As long as it saves the lives of 
Uh 
Students 
Which is a responsibility of the school system 
I think that 
Uh 
That’s perfectly fine 
Um 
Let me see here 
Like 
Um 
You know 
If they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if 
You know 
Students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing 
They go on there just specifically to catch students 
And 
To get them in trouble 
And 
I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy 
But 
Um 
I feel as though 
You know 
As long as they save 
You know 
Save lives or make the school a better and safer place 
I don’t think that that’s an invasion at all 
Um 
Should I elaborate more on that 

Yeah um 
Alright 
Well 
Um 
Hmm 
It’s a lot easier to 
Uh 
Express yourself 
Um 
A lot longer when you’re writing 
But 

Alright 
Well 
Um 
Like what I was saying 
It is a public thing 
Um 
And with a student posting something on Myspace 
And 
Not expecting to get in trouble 
That’s ridiculous 
Um 
Everything 
Like I’m 
Uh 
Worried to post stuff like even through emails 
Um 
Like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email 
Because 
I’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up 
And 
You know 
Everything like 
Everything nowadays comes back 
And 
You know 
Bites you in the butt I guess you could say 

Um 
Like 
You know 
If you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow 
And 
Like 
Once it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet 
And 
Um 
You know 
If you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it 
You will get in trouble 
And 
I don’t 
It wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy 
Because 
You know 
Like I said before 
And 
Well that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing 
And 
Um 
I don’t know 
Let’s see here 

Um 
Like I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students 
But 
If they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place 
Um 
Then I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them 
Or 
Um 
Other officials such as the police to go on 
Um 
You know 
When parents drop their students off at school they feel as though 
You know 
They’re dropping them off at a safe place 
I’ve actually discussed that with a 
Um 
A 
Uh 
Teacher of mine 
I went to a public high school 
And 
Um 
They say 
You know 
We have to ensure stuff like this 
Because 
Like 
We would do like lock downs 
And 
Stuff 
And 
Um 
That’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks 
Uh 
We had to be safe about that 
We had like drill stuff 
And 
Even though that doesn’t have anything to do with the 
Well I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting 
Because 
Um 
That was incase people would come into the building I guess 
Um 
So we 
You know 
We did practice that stuff 
Um 
In order to make the school a safer place 
And 
That’s just what the school officials were doing in this case 
They were just making it a safer place 
Um 
Preventing anything bad from happening 
Like 
Columbine or something like that 
Um 
Yeah that’s basically all I can come up with 

Uh no that’s about it
