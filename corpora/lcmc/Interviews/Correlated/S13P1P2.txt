Can I ask a question clarifying that

Uh it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like

O ok
Um
No I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy
On sites such as Myspace if
I mean if you post information on the internet it’s
It’s pretty much available for everyone to see
And I understand on Myspace you know you have to have
Someone else has to be a member in order to see someone’s profile
You might need to
You know be their friend or something like that
But you’ve
If that’s the case you’ve accepted that person as your “friend” so they can see it
You’re giving them permission to see your profile
So
I mean anytime you put information on the internet
You pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that
So if I think that was actually good
That somebody saw that
And was able to prevent a life from being lost

Hum
Um
That’s tough
Because I mean obviously you can’t have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody’s different profiles
Of all the students in the school to prevent that
But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think
O let’s look at the bad kids and make sure they’re not up to anything
Um
I mean
I don’t think it would really be right
To go and have somebody’s job be to look at peoples profiles
But I guess it all depends
On like what situation they came across that profile
Or was someone just randomly looking at peoples
And just randomly happened to see that
Or were they actually looking for
You know
Some sort of evidence that the student was planning something 
So I don’t really know

Sure
Um
Well um like
I mean I I don’t have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook
I do
It bothers me that I know that there’s creepy people out there
Who can see things about me
And I saw something on tv once that was about this
Um
This man who just
He was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily
And he went onto this girls profile and got her screen name right away
And was talking to her on instant messenger
In like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him
And I mean 
Personally I certainly wouldn’t meet with someone
But I have had people in my classes
Who I don’t’ recognize their screen names
But they IM me and they know that it’s me
And it 
Its hard because you think that they know your interest 
They know what you look like
Sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day
Who your friends are
They pretty much know a lot about you
All sorts of photos 
And I tried to limit what I put up there 
But at the same time 
The whole point
I think 
The reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends 
I don’t want to limit it too much
So it’s a tricky issue
Because I only accept people I know
I mean you never know really
Who can look at what
So

Hum
Uh
Well
I heard
My roommate was telling me that her
Um
High school she 
There was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school
And
That struck me as a little bit strange 
Like I wasn’t sure how 
How high school officials had the power to tell their students
That they weren’t allowed to have a Myspace

And
I don’t know if that’s really privacy issue
But I think 
I don’t really know
How they had the right to tell people

That’s the only other thought I can think of 

Yes
