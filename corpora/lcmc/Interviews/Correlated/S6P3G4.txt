Yes 
I think marriage within the state is a secular institution and I think that’s different from the religious ideal of marriage between a man and a women 
And I think that the state as a secular institution does not have the right to discriminate on that basis 
I think that it’s ridiculous that you can allege that 
That marriage performed by essentially a public notary or a justice of the peace is somehow the same as marriage performed by a priest or by a rabbi or something like that 
And I think attempts to structure American laws to enforce that religious ideal really go against the grain of what our constitution says 
I think that gay people should have right to get married if they want to 
I think that a marriage license is applied for through the state is really 
Not that they mean it 
But in a way is analogous to like a drivers license that’s not something you can discriminate about 

Um 
I really feel that the argument against gay marriage really just mixes religion and politics to an unfair extent 
I think that the arguments you hear coming from a lot of right wing conservatives are of that that marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a women and that might be true to them and their religions are free to enforce that within their own churches but I don’t think that’s something that can be enforced on a federal level or even a state level and I think that a lot of states are beginning to state supreme courts at least are beginning to recognize that 

Um 
(Do-di-do)
Really I just see Bush’s push for the ban on gay marriage as a extension of that that kind of sacred institution between a man and a women mindset which doesn’t work out within the secular setting 
Um 
I think that it will eventually be defeated in Congress and I think that it should 
And I think that’s an issue that he really needs to drop because he’s he’s really just kind of muddying the political process with it at this point 
I really think its disgusting how in the last elections that the gay marriage ban was put on the amendment to get voters out to the polls and try to galvanize the republican base 
And it was really used more as a political tactic then an actual concern for the issue and I think its still being used that way 
And to me that a very disgusting thing to do politically speaking 
Um 
What was the second half of it 

Oh right 
Right 
Um 
I think like it or not they’re going to be 
But I think that in the long term it’s a 
Its an issue that will be decided on a state by state basis because that seems to be the way that the federal supreme court is going with this issue 
They refused to hear any number of cases regarding relating to 
Um 
Gay marriage except for that one which kind of came to an ambiguous resolution anyway 
And I really think its going to come down to state supreme court deciding on case by case basis 

Um 
No 
None really except that I strongly feel that its really just being used as an issue as a device of wedge issue
