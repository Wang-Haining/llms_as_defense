I think that it’s about time that they finally started to
Uh
Open up about that
Especially since marijuana itself isn’t really that dangerous of a drug
It has been 
It hasn’t had any proven like scientific
Uh
Major impacts on the brain
Or the body in general 
Maybe a little bit of damage to the lungs
But we can say that about cigarettes smoking too 
But that’s legal for people over 18
So I really don’t feel like it’s a big issue 
Like they’re trying to make it out to be 
I think that many of them still have the mind set that they had back in the fifties
When they were throwing out propaganda here and there to try and crack down on the use of marijuana And I just feel that marijuana isn’t nearly as dangerous as even alcohol
Which as we have seen 
Uh 
There ‘s been many drunk driving incidents 
Uh 
You can you you’ve probably seen fights 
Or anything else break out over the use of alcohol 
And you just don’t see that with marijuana 
At least I feel that way 

Uh
I don’t say they’re really the similar to alcohol in a way 
Because 
I don’t know 
Marijuana
I don’t know 
Has different effects on the brain 
On the brain 
And while marijuana is a stimulant alcohol is a depressant
And  usually when you’ve associated someone with smoking marijuana
You don’t see them as over blown ego thinking that they can do things that they really can’t
Like you do with alcohol 
And that’s how we get into the incidents with drunk driving
And all that 
So yeah I think that it should be illegal 
Or be legal 
Because uh it’s effects are actually much less intense then those of alcohol 
And you see there’s a lot rarer cases
Like of negative incidents with the use of marijuana 
Especially when it comes down to alcohol poisoning and other illnesses that are related to alcohol 
Cirrhosis of the liver 
Uh 
You don’t really 
I’ve never heard of someone going to the emergency room 
Because they’ve smoked too much marijuana 
Or anything of that nature 

Well I think that
Uh
I really think that it’s not dangerous
And really shouldn’t be illegal in the first place
I think that most of the things that are keeping it illegal are actually just 
Uh
Out dated mindsets 
And the unability inability to open up 
And see that this his drug as like the classified isn’t as dangerous as they are trying to make it out to be People want to say that it is extremely dangerous 
That is causes all this chaos 
Makes people lazy 
And all of that 
But then again you look at alcohol 
There’s a high percentage of alcoholics 
And you don’t see people actually physically addicted to marijuana 
Like you do
I don’t know even alcohol
And cigarettes
And all of that stuff we still have legal

Uh no
I think that’s about all
