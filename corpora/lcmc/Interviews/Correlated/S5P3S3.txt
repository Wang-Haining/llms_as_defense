Um 
Gender discrimination 
Personally I haven’t ever been a victim of gender discrimination 
Um 
I believe that does exist 
I don’t 
Not from particular instances I really know of 
But I guess that something you 
I was always just grown up like one of those things that you just always knew or always heard about or always thought you knew but never knew where it came from 
Um 
I mean I think that there could be discrimination on both parts 
In certain jobs and 
Uh 
For men and women 
Women that women are depicted to be better in certain jobs and men in other jobs and what not 

Um 
I think that its just people personally they’ll 
They have to change themselves 
They have to 
They grow probably with new generations coming in 
I think that it will change over time 
I just think that there are some people have grown up a certain way 
And there stuck in their ways 
And they just don’t want to change 

Um 
Yeah I think that men are discriminated against probably against 
Uh 
Like I was more thinking of like 
Say a nanny 
Or a babysitter 
Or a nurse 
People look more 
I mean I know there are men nurses 
More men nurses but people look at them like oh why is a guy doing that a guy can’t do that 
And they think a woman 
Women can and then when a women does something they get all offended if someone says oh a women can’t do that  
But they’re doing the same thing to men when it comes to babysitting 
I doubt a women would leave her child with a man 
As like a nanny or something 
So 

Um 
No
