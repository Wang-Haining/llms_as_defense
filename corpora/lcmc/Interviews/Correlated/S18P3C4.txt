Um 
It needs to change with the times 
But 
I don’t think there’s any really large reason why they should over do a 
A complete overhaul of their practices right now 
Um 
So 
No 

Yeah 
Like 
Um 
The second Vatican was a big deal 
‘Cause 
It like 
‘Cause 
Before that people were really feeling alienated at mass 
And 
Um 
Like it was 
Mass was in Latin 
Like you 
Priests were facing the wall 
I mean 
It was very cryptic 
And 
Old fashioned 
But 
Now I mean I don’t feel that in the society we are right now 
No one 
Anyone goes to mass 
And 
Thinks that it’s outdated 
I mean there are like certain rituals that always are done like every week 
But 
Like 
The homily is really a good place 
Time where 
I don’t know 
The priest can talk about modern issues 
So 
There’s nothing I see really too old fashioned to the point of it being 
Like detrimenting from the mass right now 
So 
I don’t think they should overhaul it now 
But 
They should in the future if anyone feels like it’s 
They’re not participating fully in it where it’s getting old fashioned to the point where it’s archaic they should change it 

I really have no no really big opinion on that 
I don’t really think that it would have made the difference 
Because 
All of the priests up to this point have been able to control themselves 
And 
I just look at this as another awful time for the Catholic Church like the crusades were 

I mean 
Human beings are human beings 
And 
Just because you are a priest 
Or 
Higher up in the church doesn’t mean that you’re infallible 
Unless you’re the pope 
But 
Um 
So 
Human beings will make mistakes 
That’s just 
And 
This is just a really really large mistake that they Catholic Church is making as human beings 

Um 
Nope
