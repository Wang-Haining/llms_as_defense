Um 
Wow I don’t know too much about this 
Uh 
Let’s see 
The Catholic Church has to 
Can you repeat the question 

Um 
Yeah I I think obviously with all religions there they’re written and 
Uh 
And interpreted from an old school perspective and I don’t think really any religion kinda cope to to now a days 
I think the Catholic Church gets a little worse wrap because they’re a little more outspoken per say 
Um 

Uh as in like they’re the voice your hear 
Is outspoken even the word I’m looking for or they are spoken I guess is where they then if 
You know there is no like Hebrew church or there’s like lots of different Mosques and so forth and 
But there’s like the Catholic Church and the Vatican and it’s kinda like 
Um 
It’s like they say something it’s set in stone 

It’s more 
It’s more of an international 
Um 
You know 
Um 
Topic as opposed to like other religions aren’t as front and center 
Um 
Especially I guess having to do with gay marriage and uh 
Then 
And um 
Abortion and all kinds of 
Like the raping 
Not the raping 
The the priests that had that have had the issues I guess in like Massachusetts or wherever that is 
There’s kinda some controversial issues that seem to effect all religions but are touched on publicly by the Catholic Church so I think they put themselves in a situation where they 
They become 
You know 
The voice the people want to hear maybe for right or for wrong 
They’re not really with the times but they’re also just 
But at least they’re speaking upon it I guess you’d say 

Like not really sure 
I don’t know too much about the Catholic Church though 

Hm 
I think 
Hm 
Well the priests marrying 
That’s a good 
Uh 
Yeah perhaps 
I think that might do something to it 
I think we’re also talking about priests here that have had psychological you know disorders and they’re 
They 
That 
Having other priests 
You know 
Changing the rules I should say might not may make that not happen in the future per say 
But these people probably have some deep seeded issues I guess 
But I think that probably would help 
Yeah I think that open mindedness towards uh 
Towards women and uh marriage would be 
Probably 
Probably help it out 

Um 
Well yeah I guess 

I think they probably had some kind of like power 
You know like 
People that rape you know they do it for power they do it for 
Um you know 
I 
For control and and I think they kinda had the same thing 
They realized a situation where they they had a lot of um leverage working with kids 
You know you can’t tell them 
They’re not going to believe you 
This is me 
You know I’m the priest here and I think they kinda 
That type of a psychology that’s what they used and uh 
Had some some problems already 
I think that kinda just furthered them 
That they had the power to act upon them 

Um 
Not particularly 
No
