I don’t think that’s a good idea 
Because 
Marijuana is illegal for a reason 
It affects the way you think 
And the person that you are 
And it has some very negative lasting side effects 
Well 
Effects 
I guess you would say 
That 
Are undesirable 
Which is why it’s illegal 
It’s addictive 
And 
Most importantly 
I would say 
It’s the gateway drug to other drugs 
People think marijuana is totally harmless 
And it might not be the worst of the drugs that you could do 
But it definitely has 
Um 
Problems associated with it 
And 
The biggest of those problems is that it can lead you 
To do other drugs that could be even more harmful 
And 
Just lead to overdose 
Death 
So many bad things can happen as a result of drug use 
And 
Um 
By legalizing it 
That would only be encouraging that kind of behavior 

No 
I don’t think so 
Um 
Alcohol also has negative effects 
But 
Marijuana’s effects are so much more amplified 
And 
Alcohol doesn’t necessarily lead you to 
To abuse other substances 
Um 
Usually alcoholism happens by itself 
But 
Um 
Drug addiction happens with multiple drugs 
So 
Marijuana would be a problem because 
They would get involved in many drugs 
And 
Also 
There’d be a problem with 
Um 
You said legalizing small amounts of marijuana 
Well 
Like 
What’s a small amount of marijuana 
Even if you designate a specific amount 
Like 
That 
That just means there’s going to be marijuana 
Marijuana circulating a lot more 
And it’s very easy to abuse a privilege like that 

Um 
Well 
Alcohol has negative effects 
But marijuana has more negative effects 
I would say 
Like 
How it affects your brain 
And personality 
And violent behaviors 
And 
Like 
All kinds of 
Negative effects 
I don’t know particularly 
But 
I guess 
My main argument would be that 
It’s illegal because it’s harmful 
And addictive 
And  
Um 
It shouldn’t be legalized 

No
