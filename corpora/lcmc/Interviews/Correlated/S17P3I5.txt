Um 
I personally don’t support the war 
Because 
I think its ambitions are very unclear 
Um 
You see a lot in the news about it 
But we don’t know exactly what we’re fighting for 
And 
I don’t think the government has done a good job of making that clear 
Um 
In other wars in the past 
We knew exactly who our enemy was 
This is a different kind of war 
Um 
We’re fighting more of 
Like 
A 
A terrorist group 
We’re not sure exactly who they are 
Um 
So it’s a lot harder in that respect 
And it’s harder for them to define our enemy 
But 
For that reason 
The public can’t be as supportive as they would be in other times 
Because 
We 
Kind of 
Just see people dying and we don’t know why 
All the time 

Um 

Yeah 
Well 
I guess 
Um 
Like 
We just see a lot of people 
Going to war 
Not coming home 
Things like that 
Families are being broken up 
Um 
And 
It’s hard to support that 
Because we don’t see what we’re getting out of it 
Like 
We don’t know how successful we’re being in the war 
And we also don’t know when it’s going to end 
Like 
The government isn’t exactly 
Doesn’t have a specific policy that they’re following 
Like 
They set a goal for when they want to leave 
And then they might change that goal 
Or they might say they’re going to leave 
And then they might not leave 
So 
It’s kind of 
Like 
Everything’s up in the air 
And we’re just waiting to hear from higher authorities 
But 
It’s the American people who are being affected 

I think it’s gone on long enough 
Because 
I don’t see what we’re gaining from it 
I just see what it’s taking 
From the American people 

Okay 
Um 
Well 
Like I said 
People 
Like 
It’s breaking up families 
And 
Killing people 
And 
We’re just using a lot of our resources 
Towards the goal of winning the war 
But 
What are we establishing for the United States exactly 
No 
No one really knows 
I don’t think 
Or 
If they know 
They’re not doing a very good job of making it clear 
So 
Um 
As far as the American public goes 
They just see it as 
An expense 
And 
Not a gain 
Like 
Um 
Terrorist actions 
Like 
Could still happen 
It’s not like we’re 
100% guaranteed of no terrorist actions as a result of this war 
Like 
We’re still in jeopardy 
We still don’t know what could happen to us at any given time 
But 
We’re using all of our money and time and American lives in an effort 
That we don’t really know what it’s for 

No
