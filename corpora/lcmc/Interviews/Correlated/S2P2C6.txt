Um 
Yeah 
I would say that 
Ah 
The Catholic Church should adapt 
Cause there seems to be 
Um  
Kind of like 
(pause) 
Hmm 
A 
I don’t know if I would say like rituals or whatever that are kind of like ancient 
And like in our modern society its kind of like 
It seems like silly 
Um 
Like all the 
Ah 
Just the 
The actions and stuff of the ceremony in church it seems like it could be a little 
More like fluent or whatever 
Just like 
Um 
How they had a Vatican counsel and made a bunch of modern changes 
I think they could use another one 
Um 
Especially concerning like 
Marriage and 
Um 
(pause) 
Things like that 
And letting women be priests 
Cause especially now a days when there having a shortage of priests 
Um 
I think it would be kind of intelligent to allow women to be priests 

Or priestesses 

Um 
Well the whole pedophilia issue I think was kind of expanded by the media more then it actually was 
But 
Um 
I 
I think 
Um 
Whether or not that’s true or not 
Um 
If marriage was introduced into the church and priests were allowed to get married and women were allowed to be priests or priestesses then 
Um 
It definitely would have prevented some of the pedophilia just logically it it must have 
Or would have 
But 
Um 
(pause) 
Um 
(pause) 
I kinda lost my train of thought 
(laughs) 

Actually yeah repeat the question 
I want to say one more thing 

Oh 
Oh yeah 
Alright 
Well 
Well yeah 
I definitely think that they should adapt to modern times and allow priests to get married 
Because 
Um 
Even if like the media kinda expanded that issue 
Um 
It would 
It would give the Catholic Church a much better like view to the common people 
Or just like to 
To its followers cause it seems like now a days 
Um 
Whether its like media or like 
In um 
Like TV shows or anything it seems like the Catholic Church is kind of laughed at and kind of like mocked 

And I think it really like undermines 
Um 
The church as a whole because I know that there’s 
The majority of priests are not 
Um 
Pedophiles and there actual good men who devoted their life to like a worthy cause 
So I think if they made changes like that they could kinda prevent this undermining of the church 

Um no
