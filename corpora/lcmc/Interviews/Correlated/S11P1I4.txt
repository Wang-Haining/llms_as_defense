Um in general 
I don’t feel we should’ve gone over there, but now that we’re there 
We can’t leave 
Everything will fall apart 
Um 
We took out the government and we don’t really have one set in place 
So 
Everyone’s calling for us to pull out, but if we do we leave them with no system of government 
No system to fall back on 
Um 
Generally, I don’t agree with the way it’s being fought 
But that’s something for 
You know 
Strategists to decide 
Not something for the common person 
And unfortunately there is a lot of things going on over there that aren’t good 
But then there are also things that get blown up in the media 
We don’t really know what’s going on 
Um 
We’re not there 
We can’t 
People who are discussing this on the round hill aren’t there 
The people who are there aren’t really talking about it because it’s not really a pleasant thing to talk about it when you finally come home 
And 
I don’t know if anybody here really knows what’s going on 
Um 
Hmm 
Let’s see 
Here’s the thing 
We are 
We’re trying to be the big brother for the entire world and take care of everyone and really we can’t don’t that 
It’s not our job and it shouldn’t be our job 
Everyone needs to kind of take care of themselves 
But by shoving ourselves in there 
By putting ourselves in that position we’re making ourselves not 
We’re putting ourselves in a bad light to the rest of the world 
And whether you’re supporting the troops or you’re supporting the war 
To the rest of the world it looks like the same thing 
And the media around the world has basically turned this into we’re there just because we want to spread Democracy 
Maybe that’s not the right government for that area so we have no idea what to really do over there 
It’s at this point 
We’re at a complete standstill 
And it’s 
It’s really not sure what’s gonna happen next 
I don’t think anybody is 

Um 
I think we can’t feasibly leave any time soon because there is no system of government there 
There is no system put in place that when we leave it’s not gonna fall apart 
Um 
Unfortunately we caused that situation 
I don’t think we can feasibly end this war anytime soon 
Although I’m not sure if it’s completely a war anymore 
If that’s the right wording for it 
Um 
I don’t think that 
It’s not necessarily a war anymore 
Yes there are guerilla 
There’s guerilla tactics going on, but the amount of troops that keep going over there I think is not necessary 
Um 
I think that the people that are there now 
Some of the people should be able to come home 
Some of them have been there since the beginning and haven’t been able to come home 
It’s 
It’s kind of turned into a big snafu 
Um 
Everything is just going crazy 
It’s just almost like 
You know 
We’re in the heat of the moment you make decisions 
But they aren’t good decisions so you kind of have to go back and tweak them and I don’t think anybody’s going back and looking at the decisions they’ve made previously 
They’re just going back and looking at what happened in the beginning 
Um 
Not really.
