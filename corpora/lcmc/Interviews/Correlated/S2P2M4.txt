Well um 
I think it’s a pretty good idea because 
Um 
I think uh most people treat alcohol and marijuana as two completely separate topics 
But uh 
I think they’re 
They’re closely linked in that they’re both they’re both 
Um you know 
They’re both vices 
And they both have 
Um 
I don’t know if you wanna say benefits 
But 
They both have separate benefits and obviously bad things about them 
Um 
So I think having alcohol as a legal substance is kinda hypocritical when it doesn’t go along with marijuana 

Well 
Um 
I think they both make you intoxicated in different ways 
Um 
I don’t know if there’s been different studies and stuff but it seems like um driving
Um 
Drinking impairs your driving more and motor skills or things like that 
Um 
Also 
I mean they have 
They’re different 
Bad things about them like drinking obviously hurts your liver and 
Um marijuana I’m not sure if it was proven but they say kills brain cells and stuff 
So I mean 
I think that both should be treated as kind of a 
The same kind of thing on the same level 
So I think its kind of hypocritical to have alcohol as a legal substance when its not accompanied with marijuana 

Uh yeah 
I would say so cause I 
Me personally I think alcohol is the worse vice than marijuana I think 
Um 
The danger is greater with alcohol and 
Um 
I mean if I were to pick one that 
I mean both are bad but 
If I were to pick one kinda like a lesser of two evils I would say marijuana 

Well 
Um 
I mean drunk drivers you hear about all the time on on the uh 
From the media and everything 
Also 
Um 
The health implications are more 
Um 
I guess like solid the the research or whatever 
Like I mean if you drink you know you’re gonna hurt your liver and other things as well 
But marijuana it doesn’t seem like there’s any solid evidence towards any real long term health risks 
I mean uh 
They say there’s some implication of brain cell damage I’m not sure if any of that is really solid or whatever 

Uh no
