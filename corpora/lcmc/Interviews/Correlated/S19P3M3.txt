Um 
I feel 
I feel as though it was a good idea 
Um 
Marijuana is one of the most widely used drugs as it is 
And 
Um 
I think that by legalizing it the government would have more control over it 
And 
It would prevent 
Um 
A lot of crime 
And 
It would free jails up of people who are in jail for possession of marijuana 
Which is kind of a ridiculous thing to send people to jail for 
Because 
It’s no more potent than like alcohol 
So 

Um 
Yes 
Because 
I mean you’ve never heard of anybody overdosing on too much marijuana 
And 
People die from alcohol poisoning 
Or 
Alcohol related accidents all the time 
And 
Um 
It pretty much 
It does 
I think alcohol might even be worse than marijuana in its effects 
So 
I feel that by legal 
If you were gonna legalize alcohol the I think legalizing marijuana would be good 
OK too 

Um 
Just 
Because 
Like 
There’s so many diseases related to alcohol 
So many people addicted to alcohol 
Um 
So many people have died from alcohol 
Like 
Nobody’s died from smoking too much marijuana 
Yeah there’s lung cancer 
But 
You get lung cancer from smoking cigarettes 
And 
That’s legal also 
So 
Um 
If 
Since marijuana just seems to be a lot less dangerous drug than alcohol then I think that it should be legalized 

Uh 
No
