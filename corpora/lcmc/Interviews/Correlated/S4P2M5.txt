Um 
Well first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and 
You know 
Just because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties 
Um 
So 
I mean as far as 
Having it available for the public I’d say no 
Absolutely no 
But 
Using it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes 
Because 
Just because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial 
It’s not beneficial 
You know what I mean 

Yeah 
Um 
I mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use 
Like oxycotton 
Um 
Vicodin 
Perocets 
That kind of thing 
And those are controlled substances 
But we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits 
Just because there’s a taboo around marijuana then 
A 
There’s no point in doing that for me 
You should embrace its beneficial properties I think 

Um 
I don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it 
Although if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things 
Um 
It’s a tough one 
I’d say 
Not 
You could integrate it 
Like let it become legal gradually but not all at once 
Because then it would be abused but if you just 
You gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first 
And then people might use it responsibly 

Uh 
Yeah 
Um 
People have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug 
But 
I mean it’s not that bad for you 
It’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that 
Um 
So 
I mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly 
And certainly for medical purposes 

Nope
