Um 
I’m all for it 
I mean ah 
Let’s see 
For medicinal purposes I don’t really know what the medical value is of it but um 
I know from experience what pot does in that I’m for it 
Um 
I think in small amounts that way it wouldn’t be used for like uh selling or you know any type of business or financing for any other types of drugs that could be more detrimental to society 
But I don’t see pot as being as being too bad 

I mean uh 
Can you define small amounts please 

Sure sure 
Um 
Well in terms of personal use if its staying inside your house and its not making its way into the rest of society 
Um 
Or you know uh 
And if you’re doing it 
I’m assuming the people are responsible with it and are not um 
Abusing it 
Taking small amounts lots of times so it kind of defeats the purpose of small amounts then its it seems fair to me 

Well 
Uh 
I think that alcohol isn’t as mentally addicting as marijuana is but I think with pot its different because 
You know because 
Well for me at least when I 
I can drink and the next day you don’t feel so well you don’t wanna drink 
But when you smoke you don’t have that same type of hangover or effect 
It’s like a 
It’s almost like a less 
For me I think it’s a less serious drug then alcohol 
Um 
Although 
I’m sorry what was the beginning of this question 
I kinda took off topic there 

Oh ok 
Um 
No then 
Yeah no not regarding 
I’d say no 
I think its 
I think it effects different parts of your brain 
Uh psychologically 

And then that in turn effects you physically differently 

Well 
I mean 
I think first of all people that buy in small amounts 
Uh like grams and and dime bags nickel bags things of that nature are generally younger people 
People that uh that maybe starting off or um 
Or don’t really have a big time or a big dealer or something where they can pick up more more pot and in that regard um 
If you legalize small amounts then maybe the people that will be starting off younger uh 
Actually I don’t know if that’s a good thing now that I think about it 
Maybe that would be a bad thing maybe easier for young people to start off cause they’ll be able to find smaller amounts 
Interesting I didn’t think of it like that 
But uh 
No I think it’s uh 
I think with legalization of small amounts it could also take away from the big amounts that would be sold out there 
 
And it could also be a pretty lucrative industry if contained properly 
I mean the tobacco industry does a killing literally here in the United States and I think if regulated properly it would take away from a lot of 
Uh crossing 
I mean from the North and South border uh problems 
That’s 
Drugs are definitely one of the biggest issues with the borders which is a big issue in our country right now 

Um well 
Sure 
I mean pot is 
It it it does effect I think it’s like the thalamus or what is it whatever it is hypothalamus 
Whatever it messes with your brain 
It’s a drug 
It does lead to other drugs obviously 
I mean whether people admit it or not it is a gateway drug 
 
And I don’t think you want people doing other drugs 

Uh 
No 
No not really 
I mean I think it 
I think no matter legal or not 
Or you know or unlegal or non legal whatever it is illegal 
Um 
You know its gonna have its place in different age brackets and 
You know societal roles in our country 
That’s just the way it is 

Uh 

Uh well 
See I’ve been smoking pot since I was in 10th grade and I stopped 4 days ago for the first time in a long time 

I’ve been actually clean minus the drug test I had to pass two years ago for a job 
Um which I did miraculously in 10 days 
Since a long time ago 

That’s all
