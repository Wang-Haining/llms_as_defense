Um
I feel as though it is still an issue
Um
Although there’s been a lot of laws helping women to gain equality
And
Things like that
I feel as though like if a man and a woman go up for a high position job and are equally qualified a man’s more likely to get the job solely based on his gender
And
I mean it’s been known to happen so
And
Also like in today’s society you still hear like sexist jokes
And
TV shows making fun of gender
Like
Obviously if it wasn’t an issue then I don’t think it would be made fun of

Um
It’s just a lot about changing people’s mindset
I don’t think that instating laws and suing companies for gender discrimination is gonna change the way people think
It’s more of a personal decision to want to change it rather than like imposing change on people
Like
You can’t change the way people think
They have to want to change it themselves

Um
I don’t feel as though they are
I feel as men do a lot more
Are the ones that do the most of the discriminating against
And
I don’t think that they would discriminate against each other
So
I don’t think that they’re as victim to it as women are

Um
Well
I mean
You don’t hear like women like making jokes about the inadequacies of men really
I mean
I’m sure there are jokes
But
Like
They don’t like bring it up in like random conversation
Like
My guy friends will like be having a conversation
And
They’ll just say like sexist jokes just to be funny
But
I don’t sit here saying oh this about guys you know

So
I mean I don’t think men are discriminated against
I feel as though they always have the upper hand when it comes to job position
And
Things like that so

Nope
