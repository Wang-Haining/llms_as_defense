Um 
Let’s see I do feel it is somewhat there 
Or 
It actually definitely is there 
Um 
I know a lot of people joke around with the issue 
Um 
Like oh make me a sandwich or something of that sort 
Um 
Obviously against women right there 
Um 
But 
Now if you look at my personal life 
I 
Um 
I’m a secretary for a real estate company 
And 
Um 
That’s not your 
Uh 
Stereotypical eighteen year old male job right there 

Um 
Let’s see 
Uh 
You know 
Like 
If 
I mean I’m sometimes embarrassed even to say that 
You know 
I like to 
Um 
I actually come out first sometimes saying 
You know 
Oh I’m desk management as a joke 
But 
Then I say I’m a secretary 
Um 
But 
You know 
The stereotypical secretary is going to be a female 
Um 
You know 
Age doesn’t matter 
I work 
Well I mainly work with all females 
Um 
Uh 
Well definitely all the other secretaries are female 
Um 
And 
I know when I was 
Um 
When I first applied and first was hired 
Um 
All the agents from the real estate company came down and was like oh it’s awesome to have a male down here finally 
Um 
And 
It’s 
You know 
It all really comes down to stereotypes 
Um 
A stereo
Like a stereotypical secretary could definitely multitask 
Um 
Stereotypical male can’t multitask 
Um 
I don’t know that’s just something I’ve always 
You know 
Grown up hearing 
Um 
Now if you look at 
Um 
The stereotypical job for a male versus stereotypical job for a female 
Um 
The male would definitely be a like construction worker 
Or 
Something of the sort 
Uh 
Female could be a secretary or I guess a housewife 
Um 
Let’s see 
And 
Now if you have like 
If you have a job 
Or 
Um 
An example of a man being a stay at home dad 
That’s definitely not 
Uh 
What people expect 
Um 
You could always relate that back to 
Uh 
Full House or something like that with Danny Tanner 
Can’t believe I know that name but 
Um 
Yeah 
Um 
You know 
That’s not your stereotypical thing 
But 
It’s a sitcom I guess 
So 
Anything’s 
You know 
I don’t know 
I don’t know where I’m going with that 
But 
Um 
You know 
Uh 
You do not expect 
Um 
I guess people to shift between 
Um 
Specific gender jobs 
Um 
You know 
A nurse is generally a female 
Um 
But nowadays it’s starting to come out 
Um 
I know 
I know somebody who was a male nurse 
And 
Um 
I guess Ben Stiller in one of 
I think it’s like Meet the Parents 

Um 
Is a nurse as well 
So 
And 
They joke about that 
Um 
Saying oh you’re a doctor 
No actually I’m a nurse 
Um 
I know that was kinda funny 
Because 
Most people don’t expect a male to be a nurse 
Um 
So 
I feel as though the gender discrimination all comes down to stereotypes 
Um 
And 

Well 
Um 
I had actually 
Um 
We 
This had 
Uh 
Came up in my FE100 class 
Um 
Earlier on this year 
And 
I actually think 
Um 
Gender is really something that you’re raised upon 
Um 
At a certain age 
Um 
Like 
Toys 
Like 
Um 
Baby toys 
Uh 
Can generally go 
Um 
Either way unless they’re pink or blue 
But 
I guess that’s really where 
Um 
You know 
Boys start to know what boys are 
And 
Girls start to know what girls are 
And 
What they like 
Uh 
That’s when everything a boy buys is gonna be blue everything a girl buys is gonna be pink 
Um 
Let’s see here 
Um 
Well with that 
Like for instance 
I had talked with one of my professors this year 
Or 
Actually a 
Um 
An administrator here at Loyola 
And 
He said it was about 
Or 
One of his daughters likes Thomas the train 
Or 
Whatever that thing is called 

And 
Um 
He just can’t buy anything for that 
Because 
She’s a girl 
Um 
So 
He said he had to end up buying boy whitey tightys for her to wear 
Because 
She liked 
You know 
Thomas the train so much 
Um 
So it starts to come I guess with the industries nowadays in the US 
Um 
People are brought up upon 
Uh 
Knowing what gender is 
Uh 
It’s just how they’re raised 
Um 
Girls are supposed to like this 
Girls are supposed to play with dolls 
Girls are supposed to have makeup 
Um 
And 
Then 
You know 
Guys 
You know 
Guys need GI Joes 
And 
Toy guns 
And 
Stuff 
And 
I guess 
Uh 
The companies nowadays in the US 
And 
Actually the world 
Uh 
All just kind of produce that for aiming at specific ages 
And 
I guess because of this 
Um 
They all just 
Um 
They kind of form opinions for the kids 
And 
Don’t really give them a chance to express themselves 
Um 
In ways that they want 
I had also talked with my RA 
And 
Um 
He is a male obviously 
But 
He is a feminine male I guess you could say 
Um 
That’s simply because he spent a lot of time with his mom growing up 
So 
Um 
I guess 
Um 
You know 
He is definitely not your stereotypical male 
But 
You know 
He’s still a male nonetheless 
So 
Um 
Hmm 

Um 
Men and women are 
I feel as though 
Um 
That is definitely the case 
Um 
I know with me being a secretary 
I know I take some um 
I take some jokes 
You know I’m not gonna lie 
But 
Um 
I also make those jokes 
Um 
You know 
I don’t feel as though there’s anything wrong with me being a secretary or anything 
Um 
It gets me money that’s all I care about 
But 
Um 
Let me see here it’s 
There’s definitely 
Like if there was a woman construction worker 
Um 
I could bet you a lot of people will 
You know 
Say oh what is she doing working there 
You know 
She 
Because 
If you look at 
Um 
The 
Uh 
Stereo 
Again stereotypical male stereotypical female 
Uh 
The female would be weak 
And 
The male would be like very strong 
Um 
I believe a term I’ve heard 
Um 
Earlier this year was like alpha hegemonic male or something like that 
Um 
It’s basically like 
You know 
I’m very strong I’m buff I do everything type of male 
Uh 
And 
Women are generally known 
Um 
In the stereotypical sense to be I guess 
Um 
Helpless or something like that 
Not that I’m saying that that’s the case 
I’m just saying that that’s stereotypically the case 
Um 
They’re just more of a caring 
Um 
Caring gender with the whole motherly issue 
Um 
And 
I feel as though 
I guess the body’s natural ways also influences the 
Um 
The ways people think about 
Uh 
Women and men 
Uh 
Related 
Uh 
Obviously with the women having the children 
You know 
They have the motherly sense 
And 
Men having more muscle naturally 
Um 
They would be able to have different jobs 
Um 
And 
I don’t know I think it all really also refers to the natural 
Um 
Male and female bodies as well as far off as that may seem 
But 
Um 
I think that’s about it 

Uh 
No that’s it
