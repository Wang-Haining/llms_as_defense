Um 
For gay marriage 
I feel that it’s definitely something new and different and that if people want to get married who are of the same gender 
You shouldn’t call it marriage 
You should call it something else because marriage typically is defined as a union between a man and a woman 
And I know a lot of religions 
Um 
View it only as that 
Like the Catholic religion 
Marriage is only between a man and a woman and you can’t change that definition 
And so 
I’m not typically 
I’m not against same sex people living together and receiving the same benefits as a married couple viewed in the eyes of the church 
I just feel like you should call it something different so that they can have I guess 
Something more personal than a civil union because even a male and a female can enter into a civil union 
But, um 
From my understanding 
So, I feel that if they come up with a new term other than marriage it will be more widely accepted 
Um 
And I feel that it’s kind of tricky to say like if it should be allowed or not 
Um 
From state to state 
I definitely feel that it should be allowed once a new term is formed 
And accepted 
Um 
I’m not really sure if individual states should have a say on whether they allow those types of ceremonies to take place 
Um 
I guess 
No, I guess I take that back 
I feel um 
It should be openly accepted in all states to unify our country because if you have one state 
How we have it now 
We have one state saying oh yeah well marry people of the same sex and another state being totally opposed 
Then that’s kind of disunifying our country 
So I feel that they should be accepted in all states once that new term is in place 
Um 
I do feel that the federal government should be involved in having it that all states should accept it 
I don’t feel that it’s correct in George Bush’s push for an amendment because that is a personal choice, not something that the country 
Like that effects the country in that way 
Like voting 
That definitely effects the entire country 
But 
And like freedom of speech 
That effects all the people 
But, like having someone ban someone else from marrying someone of the same sex 
That’s your own personal feelings 
You don’t have to agree with the whole concept, but you should allow others to make their own personal choices so I don’t think it’s right that he’s pushing for an amendment 
Um 
Well I guess like as I was saying earlier that the whole country should come to an agreement on it so that way that our country is still unified 
Um 
And not individualized by states 
And um 
I guess I’m not 
I’m not saying that everyone has to agree 
Because obviously everyone doesn’t have to agree with everything 
And um 
I’m not really sure what else to say about that though 
Um 
I guess I should say that once they are married or not married 
But like whatever that term is that they’re going to invent 
That they should be able to receive all the financial benefits and economic benefits of any typical female male married couple because that’s one of the 
That’s probably another big reason why they’re pushing for marriage cause not only to like commit to each other just as a man and female would 
But, it’s also to like help each other out financially and grow as people together 
Um 
Economically as well as like personally 
Um 
I don’t think so 
I think that’s it
