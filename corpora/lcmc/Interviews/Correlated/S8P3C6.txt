Uh 
I wouldn’t say that they really need to change their ways 
I think that there have been a lot of incidents recently uh 
Between like pedophilia and all of that in the Catholic Church 
But that’s not 
I wouldn’t really associate that with uh 
Failure to advance and adapt to the 21st century 
I would more see that as a problem that 
Uh 
Certain people are taking advantage of 
Like maybe someone sees that the role of 
Maybe taking the role of a priest could 
I don’t know open up some new opportunities for them and it’s really what we need to do is probably rule out these people and put them to 
Give them 
Uh 
Put them to the law rather then change the whole church in general because if you force the whole church to change then that’s gonna probably 
They’re probably gonna want 
Have to change some of their beliefs that they’ve been strongly holding for all of these years and I really don’t feel like any religion really needs to change if they don’t want to 
I mean if they feel the need to adapt and progress then 
Of course they are certainly allowed to do that but it’s really up to them to decide 

I do think that it could have been changed with that 
Uh 
But once again I don’t think that it should be forced to change 
But yeah I definitely think that allowing priests to marry would have a major impact on all of that because 
I think when someone is uh 
Becomes a priest I think they have all these repressed emotions or feel like they’re repressed so they try to 
Kind of pull 
Like get rid of those feelings in some other way 
Maybe in an illegal act or manner like have been in the incidences recently 
So yeah I feel that if they allowed priests to marry this would definitely impact that 
And as for female priests 
Yeah I think that also might have a change on that 
Because uh 
As we’ve seen most priests have been 
Like are 
All priests are male and I think that kind of also can be tied in with that gender discrimination in the Catholic Church 
And uh there failure to progress with the 21st century 
But yeah 
I think that it could help 

Um 
No
