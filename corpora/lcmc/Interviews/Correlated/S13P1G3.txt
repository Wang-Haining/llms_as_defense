Ok 

This one’s a loaded question 
Um 
I 
I don’t think that either one 
Well actually maybe I’ll talk then I’ll formulate an opinion 

Um 
I used to think that it was absolutely wrong and it shouldn’t be legalized 
Um 
Now I’m not exactly sure what I think 
Um 
In terms of of gay marriage I would say that 
I mean in a heterosexual relationship the couple is allowed they’re allowed to get married its perfectly legal 
You know it’s kind of expected almost and it 
I mean it does make things easier financially and it’s just 
I mean it’s a very common practice so as its becoming more socially acceptable 
I mean I wouldn’t say that there like more gay people now then there were before but its becoming more socially acceptable and people aren’t 
You know people aren’t keeping quiet about it 

You know they’re letting people know and if they are in a relationship then on the one hand why shouldn’t they receive the same benefits whatever they be especially 
You know 
I mean I think in terms of like why 
Let me think 

Um 
I think that part of the reason why they would want to get married has has to do with the financial issues 
The legal issues 
Whatever so that they can say that we are married and up until 
Up until now I mean 
Most states it hasn’t been allowed and now its being allowed in some so I guess you could say that it doesn’t have to be legalized in all states cause they could just go to another state and get married 
But that’s also a little bit confusing cause you think that if its going to be allowed in some states and they could just go to another state then why shouldn’t it be allowed in every state 

Um 

Um 
I think that was actually because originally I 
I like you know being 
When I was younger just I 
I went to Catholic school all my life 
I was just more taught that 
You know 
Homosexuality was wrong 

But 
Um 
I’ve definitely broadened my views on that and I think along with that I realized if 
If it’s if it’s not wrong to be gay why should they be denied the privilege of being able to get married 

So 

Hm 
I 
I do think that the federal government should probably be involved only because maybe 
It seems weird 
I mean I know that there is all 
Each state has their own law but it seems a little strange to me that if were the United States why there would be certain laws like 
I mean I consider this like a kind of a large issue that we would be divided on that 

Um 
So I do think that there would be some sort of a 
I don’t know I think it makes sense for the whole country to have the same the same law regarding that 
Um 
But I 
I’m not sure 
I don’t know how I feel about 
Um 
Bush’s push to ban it 
I’m not exactly sure 
I don’t know 
I mean you can’t 
I’m sure you can’t 
You’re not really allowed to like give me more information but do you know why 
I don’t really know too much about like why he wants to ban it 

Um 
Yeah 
I mean I guess 
I mean marriage is typically thought of as being between a man and a women but 
Um 
I think 
I guess I don’t really I don’t really know enough about it but when a homosexual couple wants to get married and a heterosexual couple wants to get married I’m kind of assuming that they want to get married for pretty much the same reason’s 
I mean there’s 
If 
If the homosexual couple wants to like adopt a child or something like that it makes more sense that they would be legally bound by marriage 
Um 
I mean that that’s also a whole other issue 
But I think that that would certainly make things easier if they were were to have a child 

Then being allowed to be married 

Um 
No 

Yes
