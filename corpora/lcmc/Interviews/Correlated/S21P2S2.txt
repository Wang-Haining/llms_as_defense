Ok 
Um 
I definitely think it’s still an issue 
Not as prominent 
Not as like 
I guess you can’t really see it so much as you could 
Um 
But it’s definitely still there 
Especially in like the business setting and stuff like that 
Um 
I know from like personal experience 
Um 
My Mom started a company when we were really young from like 
Out of 
Like out of the house 
She ran it 
And um 
She still went to like school functions and did all that like school PTA stuff 
And I guess other moms just thought she was a stay at home mom but like 
When like all of our families would get together 
Like all of the dads would talk about business and meanwhile my Mom was like running her own company 
So it was just kind of weird that she had input about it 
And I don’t think they expected that 
So um 
It’s just 
I think that 
Um 
Like even with like younger generations we’re showing them like 
We’re teaching them with like little flash cards with like women nurses and male doctors and like that’s there initial like 
You know 
That’s the relation that they have with it 
So like women are nurses and men are doctors 
And that’s what they’re teaching them from when they’re very young 
So I think that kind of like sticks with them as being like the social norm and being like that’s kind of what it has to be and it’s weird if there’s like a male nurse or a male secretary 
Or even a male like preschool teacher is kind of weird 
So um 
I think we’re showing them that it’s like not accepted from when they’re very young so I think that has a really big impact 
And um 
What else? 
Um 
Hmm 
I don’t know I just think it’s definitely more like prominent in like the work place and at home cause you really rarely see like a stay at home dad 
Or you know they’re usually the ones going out and like going to work or whatever 
And the mom staying home 
So I don’t know 
I think kids are growing up with the idea of that and like they look at that as normal 
So when they see anything else or they’re exposed to anything else they think of it as not normal or weird 
So 
I don’t know 
I think it’s partially our fault 
Um 
For not being like open-minded and accepting of it and I guess like teaching it to the younger generations the way we want it to be 
So I think we have to change a lot of things like from that perspective 
And that’s really it [laughter] 
Um 
Definitely 
I feel like men almost are more pressured to be like the CEO’s and the owners and things like that 
Um 
I don’t think that like 
I think that if they ever have like a job as being like someone’s secretary or someone’s like 
Or even like some 
Like and assistant to something like a nurse to a doctor or a secretary to an owner 
Like I feel like they probably feel like they’re not good enough or that they’re not looked at correctly like I feel like they feel a lot of pressure to be like that top person 
And like make the most money 
So um 
I feel like there’s definitely a lot of discrimination against men and even if they wanted to stay home and I guess take care of the kids and like 
Like stay at home 
I think that they don’t even get a chance to do that because of society 
And I think that they would really be looked down upon for that as like weaker 
And that really has to change 
But that’ll take a lot of time I think 
Um 
I guess 
Um 
I guess they’re just looked down upon as like the weaker sex I guess 
Um 
Because they always have been 
And it’s been like that forever 
So I feel like it’s just gonna take time to change that 
Like to reverse it 
Um 
So 
That’s about it 
Um 
Nope 
Ok
