I would say yes 
Because 
Um 
A lot of the things they do are very traditional 
Like they’ve done the same things for long periods of time 
And 
It’s good to be rooted in tradition 
But it’s also important to be adaptable to change 
Um 
I guess 
A lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week 
And 
Um 
They’re very strict on how things are done 
And 
Sometimes 
I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee 
And 
Um 
They don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics 
And 
They also don’t accept people of other religions 
Um 
Like 
For example 
My mom was an Episcopalian 
No 
I’m sorry 
My dad was an Episcopalian 
My mom was a Catholic 
And they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church 
Because of my dad’s religion 

And 
Um 
That’s not really 
Like 
Being tolerant of other religions 
Um 
We always learned to 
You know 
Love others 
That’s a Catholic teaching 
But 
It’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them 
In a way like that 
So 
I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things 
But then the Catholic practice goes against it 
Because it’s so outdated 
But they continue to stick with it anyway 

Um 
I don’t think that would necessarily influence it 
I mean 
I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry 
But 
As 
I don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their 
Like 
Pedophilic behavior 
So 
Because it’s just a different realm 
Um 
It might 
But I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  

Um 
Well 
I guess 
Like 
People who molest children 
Probably would do that regardless of whether they had a 
A spouse or not 
Because it’s a child which is different than a spouse 
So if you’re going to do something like that 
You’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married 
Like 
I don’t think 
Allowing priests to be married would prevent 
Um 
Those things from happening 
I think that would probably happen regardless 

Nope
