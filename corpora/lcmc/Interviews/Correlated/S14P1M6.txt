Um 
That is a great idea 
Um 
And I have seen no evidence why 
You know against why marijuana 
I see no evidence saying that marijuana shouldn’t be legalized 
Um 
Really 
I mean in all the research that I’ve done 
Well not the research that I’ve personally done 
But, in researching the research that others have done 
Um 
Really I mean it’s a safe drug 
You know, if there’s such a thing 
I mean it’s safer than alcohol on the body 
You know there’s less of a risk than you know contracting diseases or cancer or whatever later on down the road than there is with cigarettes and cigarettes are legal 
Um 
I mean the immediate effects certainly have the potential to be dangerous 
But, it’s no less than the immediate effects of alcohol 
And as long as you know they do this in a way that’s 
You know 
They do it in a smart way 
Um 
I mean I feel like legalizing marijuana should 
You know work perfectly 
Um 
I don’t know 
Uh 
I mean I’ll agree like some 
Like the way that alcohol’s being treated 
Um 
And has been treated by 
Um 
The government 
Um 
Over the last century 
Um 
Has kind of been botched up a little bit 
Um 
But, like where we stand right now 
I don’t see where 
Like just to use alcohol as an example 
Like I don’t see where they could better control the substance then you know 
Having it just for people that are over 21 
And um 
Like I don’t know if they like 
If they un-legalized alcohol 
I mean then there would an uprising 
I mean you look at the prohibition of the twenties and thirties just to see like how that would happen 
Um 
And, I mean 
But you don’t want to make it completely legal 
Um 
Just cause I don’t know 
Um 
I guess when you look at like Europe 
Um 
When it is at least more legal than it is in the United States 
I mean it seems to be working better 
But you know if we decide that twenty one is a good year then I’m fine with that cause at least we’re setting limits on substance 
At least we’re controlling it and at least like trying to be responsible with it 
Um 
I think generally that works and I don’t see like why that wouldn’t work with marijuana 
Um 
And then you just look at some of the European countries that have legalized marijuana and 
Um 
I mean it’s just the same as alcohol 
It works over there 
Um 
I don’t see how it wouldn’t work over here 
I mean if we did legalize marijuana 
I mean that would just move the cash flow 
That would move like the quality of the drug 
And the I don’t know 
The purity of it 
Just I mean 
Um 
Instead of the cash going into the hands of drug dealers 
Um 
You know it’s actually going into small business, big business 
Maybe even the government would be making money 
Um 
I mean and you’re gonna get better forms of the drug 
It’s not gonna be potentially laced with anything 
Um 
You’re not gonna be getting sold dish weed 
Um 
But you’re gonna know that it’s not gonna be potentially dangerous 
Um 
See I just don’t really see a downside anywhere to legalizing 
Um 
I don’t know if they’re necessarily similar 
I mean they’re both definitely impairments 
Um 
You know on the senses 
But, it’s different 
At least like certain ways 
Um 
But I think it’s comparable and less 
Um 
I guess less bad 
Um 
That’s awful grammar 
Um 
But, yeah 
Uh 
No, I think I’m done.
