I feel like on one side 
Uh even though we may have had good intentions going in 
I mean with or without weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein did terrible things and wasn’t really an ideal human 
And so I guess on the kind of humanitarian justification you can kind of make more of a case for that as for weapons of mass destruction 
Um 
But when you look at it now it’s almost like that game Jenga where you pull the little pieces out and the whole wood thing topples over 
I mean Saddam Hussein was like a crack pipe holding up the Jenga pile 
I mean it’s like we wanted to pull him out because he was doing terrible things 
But now that we have pulled him out 
I mean his sort of peace by the sword and you know all of his sort of genocidal type of ways of trying to make some kind of tranquility were kinda holding back all these sectarian conflicts 
You know 
The Sunni and the Shiites 
The Kurds 
And then what have you 
Um 
And now I think the whole thing is just a big mess 
Um 
And I certainly don’t approve of the way the media has covered the issue because the media has covered the issue from oh people died today Bush sucks 
Or oh you know it’s going well, Bush is great 
And they haven’t 
I feel like the media if anyone has betrayed the American people even perhaps more so than the leader or at least on par 
They cover the war in nonintellectual and nonspecific fashion 
They never talk about the causes for all this sectarian violence 
They never talk about you know 
They never talk about any of that stuff 
All they talk about is just the raw human costs 
And now we’ve worked ourselves into a financial predicament which we’re never going to be able to dig ourselves out of anytime soon 
We’ve 
In our attempts to do something in Iraq we’ve limited our capabilities to be a kind of leading voice in the world of humanitarian aid around the world because we just simply don’t have the money to do it 
Uh 
We have a mounting national debt which is being financed by China 
Uh 
Which in addition to our trade gap with them is just kind of scary 
And I think we’ve worked ourselves into quite a situation 
So I can’t really call and say there’s an apocalypse going on right now 
But I’d say that whoever the next President is is gonna have a real sticky situation right of the bat 
I mean I don’t envy any of those guys who are running right now because they’re gonna have quite a job ahead of them when they get in 
They have to pick up this mess 
About the Presidential transition? 
Well I mean you can’t really say 
All you know is that 
I mean and one man can only do so much because he’s only one man 
You know 
He’s the Commander and Chief 
But he has the joint chiefs of staff 
And they all get in a room and they bitch at each other and they figure out what they should do 
And he has his cabinet who he appoints and all that 
I mean all in all one man can’t do anything or woman 
You know if a woman is to win the next election 
Which at this point looks like it’s going to be feasible 
I mean one person 
Even if they don’t have the power to fix the entire thing by themselves 
They do have the power to turn around and be an effective administrator 
And pick the right people for their cabinet and qualified people for their cabinet instead of just whoever they want to pick for whatever reason 
And they 
And I think more so than any other 
You know 
The bad quality of this particular administration is just the fact that I mean George Bush 
I mean I hate to bash him, but he’s just really not an effective administrator 
I mean why did he pick people like Dennis Brown who is 
You know in charge of FIMA 
He’s just not seeing 
He just doesn’t see things through very well to the end with all of their ramifications 
So whoever the next President is is gonna inherit this big mess 
A financial mess 
A military mess 
A political mess 
And I’m just really, really hoping that on a world scale nothing escalates out of this and I’m hoping that whoever the next President is 
Is much more dove-ish than hawk-ish because if they’re going to go out 
You know 
Looking to be a cowboy and prove American superiority 
Well then we’re gonna have World War III on our hands very soon 
And probably an economic crisis to go along with it 
Uh 
I mean it’s 
It’s a sticky situation 
I mean at this point I think 
I mean we have some people there who are begging us to stay because they know that if we leave they’ll be dead 
And they have some people there who are begging us to leave because they know that if we leave then they’ll be able to take power and kill people 
And I mean all in all 
I just 
I can’t really see and end in sight in terms of a time when we’d be able to just pack up and leave and say everything’s Ok 
Um 
So 
I don’t know if that means that we should leave soon or whether that means that we should stay 
Um 
But I mean if it keeps on costing us this much 
I think if nothing else than out of self-interest we have to leave because it’s 
It’s very, very, very expensive to be over there 
It’s very, very, very expensive 
And I just don’t know how much longer we’re going to be in the situation where we can responsibly do that 
Uh 
No
