Yes 
Um 
There are lots of things the catholic church could change to become more available 
And 
Open to members of the community in the 21st century 
It’s not like the Catholic Church hasn’t changed before 
I mean Vatican two that was some huge changes that went on with getting rid of the Latin mass 
And 
Having the priest actually face the congregation 
Those were huge changes for like 
In an institution that’s thousands of years old 

Um 
And 
I mean that’s reaching out to the people 
So 
I think the catholic church has to upset a lot of 
Um 
A lot of members of the catholic community 
And 
Just say the bible was not written to be taken literally word for word 
Because 
That will end the whole creation debate 
Don’t get me wrong I think that there’s elements of intelligent design like the theory who set the ball rolling 
And 
The big bang theory 
Well there’s elements in there 
But 
And 
I mean 
The guiding force behind creation there’s gotta be something there 
But 
God did not just like plunk down a bunch of monkeys and a bunch of people and say hey there goes earth 
And 
I just think it would make it a lot better if someone in the catholic church would clarify that to a lot of people 
And 
Things like that I mean this book is a great book 
The bible 
It’s 
It has amazing lessons 
And 
It is a great book of literary and moral value 
But 
It’s also thousands of years old 
And 
Rules that applied to Moses 

Do not necessarily apply to us 
Like 
Men don’t have to be cleansed nowadays after having sexual relations 

And 
Other stuff 
Women don’t have to be isolated during that time of the month so 
What makes it ok that people 
What makes it ok to still take like the rest of those rules literally 
Like 
Um 
People site in the bible where it’s against god to be gay 
And 
It’s a 
It’s a 
Um 
Perversion of god’s creation of human nature 
But 
There’s been gay people for as long as there’s been people 
So 
I mean either something happened at the very beginning with god’s great plan 

Or 
It’s all just part of it 
Um 
Catholic Church OK 

No 
No 
I don’t think pedophilia can be prevented by getting married 
Because 
If you’re a pedophile you’re a pedophile 
And 
It’s a psychological disorder 
I mean you can’t 
I don’t think there’s a way to really prevent that 
Um 
I think the priesthood may have attracted a significant number of people with pedophilia by 
Um 
Who were trying to control their urges 
Or 
To get like a structural life where they wouldn’t be tempted by such things 
And 
They just 
They found that it wasn’t enough 
Um 
I don’t think anything really could have prevented that 
And 
People look at it and say oh that’s awful 
Because 
It’s priests and they’re supposed to be the religious leaders and everything 
But 
Number one they are just people 
And 
Number two it occurs in other professions as well 
I mean 
Teachers are pedophiles and they work with children every day 
And 
They have just as important a role in children’s lives as their priests do if not more 
And 
Well I think the catholic church should be doing more to get them help instead of covering up as it did 
And 
I think now it’s doing the right thing 
Which is a big change to begin with 
Um 
I’m not saying the catholic church isn’t trying to change 
‘Cause 
I’m sure it is 
But 
There’s a lot of things in the internal workings I think of the church that need to 
Um 
Be overcome before the parts that everyone sees can be changed 

And 
I don’t pretend to know what those are 
And 
I hope that somehow it gets worked out 
I think Pope John Paul was doing a great job 
Um 
I don’t know how well Pope Benedict is going to do 
Or for how long he’s going to do it 
And 
How much of an effect he’ll have 
But 
I hope he doesn’t go the way many people think does 
Think he will 
And 
Thought he would 
Um 
And 
Bring the church back to its more conservative days 

Um 
No
