All I got to do is just talk into the microphone? 
Ok 
Well 
Um 
Actually I think it’s 
I’ve come to believe that 
Um marijuana is actually not a bad thing 
As much of a bad thing as people say it is 
But it’s kind of like 
Um like 
I think it’s called a sedative or just something that like will make you not do anything 
But I mean if it’s like stuff that’ll 
Because I know like using marijuana like could help you 
Like if you have cancer and stuff like that 
So I think that’s Ok 
But I think that they 
Um 
I don’t know I wish they could legalize it and then maybe safeguard it so only like small amounts 
Or maybe like distribute it or something 
Cause like smoking marijuana doesn’t give you cancer 
It just makes you extremely like 
Like I don’t even know like you just sit the whole time and you don’t do anything with your life 
So I think that in that sense it’s bad 
Because then with more and more like kids getting their hands on it 
They just won’t want to do anything 
But actually it’s kinda 
I guess you could say 
If they knew 
If you could figure out a way that they could distribute it for good use and then still keep it way from children so that they don’t 
You know 
Get their hands on it then I feel like it might be Ok 
Like it’s a little bit better then where it is now 
Because if you think about it 
Maybe if they legalize it then people wouldn’t want it as much 
So 
Like that’s why if 
It’s like the same thing as alcohol like if 18 year-olds get it then 18 year-olds probably wouldn’t have as much problems 
Even not 18 year-olds but younger kids wouldn’t have as much problems with alcohol as they do now because 
You know 
They can get their hands on it 
They kind of have an idea as to how to use it 
Instead of alcohol just being this really bad thing 
So maybe if they did the same with like 
Um 
With like marijuana then it probably wouldn’t be as bad 
Um 
I don’t know because I’ve heard that with 
Um 
Like I don’t think their effects are as similar 
I think that because they vary between like different people 
Like I know that 
I know some people that smoke weed and then just sit [laughter] 
Some people smoke weed and they just want to 
I don’t know they 
Like they 
Everything just goes slower for them 
But actually the only time I know when anybody wants to do anything reckless is when like you get 
Some people get drunk 
Like I know when I get drunk I just sit 
Like I don’t do anything I just get really quiet 
But other people get drunk and they want to get reckless 
But you don’t really see like you don’t really see people getting in accidents and stuff like that because they were smoking 
Like you see like 
I mean that’s like the one thing for like 
For like alcohol and stuff is that they get in accidents and they 
You know 
Do reckless things or they’ll rob places and 
You know beat up people or what not 
When they’re under the influence of alcohol 
I don’t like 
I don’t even know if you hear anything about when people are smoking 
Like you don’t hear anything 
The only bad effect of it is that it just makes you not want to do anything and that’s like 
I think that’s like the only thing they can come up with is like they’re not 
The person’s not the same anymore 
They just sit 
All they think about is getting more weed and stuff like that 
They don’t really 
They don’t really do anything to them that 
Like as bad as alcohol does 
Cause alcohol I think like effects everyone whereas 
Um 
Um weed just kind of effects you as a person 
Ok 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Um 
Besides the effect of like 
 I don’t know cause like I kinda feel like it should be legalized in a sense 
Because like if it helps people 
Then it’s also like 
It is a drug 
So it’s kinda like 
Kinda 
It goes back and forth 
Cause like if it does help people then sure 
But if it doesn’t like 
In the way that it does it help teenagers and stuff like that 
Then no it shouldn’t be 
But it’s like 
Like I said like 
Just legalizing it in small does will be better and having like a really tight control on who it goes to 
Like better than how they have with alcohol now that even if you are under the age of 21 you can get a fake ID to get it 
So I think you need to have a tighter control over that because it is a drug 
So 
Ok that’s it 
That’s all I got 
No
