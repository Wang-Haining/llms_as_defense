I’m opposed to it 

Uh 
Well I’m pretty liberal person 
I’m from Swarthmore, Pennsylvania it’s a pretty liberal hotspot of Pennsylvania and Delaware County which is a Republican County in a Democratic state 

I mean a repub 
A Democratic state in a Republican County so its 
I’ve always found myself to be part of like the liberal minority in my 
In my general area but in my town everybody’s very you know tree hugging and so forth and I I’m all for it so when I had that mentality growing up and then we get into the first major international war in my lifetime 
I don’t really look at Kosovo as the same thing or 
I wasn’t really into the Gulf war as much and then the way this just lingered on and transcended politics and in a lot of ways transcended the economy to know because oil was kinda taking a backseat to just the devastation 
So I I can’t 
I can’t be for something that I that 
I’m morally opposed to war in general 

I don’t think it solves really anything I just think it prolongs and deepens things 

Yeah sure 
I mean uh 
Well 
I look at the different cities 
We live in Baltimore and and I live close to Chester, Pennsylvania and uh Camden, Pennsylvania and I think we have a lot of domestic issues that are at this point almost as devastating as the international ones and we’ve dug our holes there deep too deep to even come back from our own problems here 
And for me I 
I 
I kinda would like to see some some resolution 
My father’s a teacher in the Chester school district of 75 kids in each class 
You know and 
And it’s 
It’s almost like we have 
We have deeper issues 
Not deeper issues but other issues that we have to start trying to get to as opposed to just putting them off to to uh prolong the war in Iraq 

I feel at this point you should maybe cut your losses 
Um 
You gotta 
You have to keep some sort of uh 
Some sort of 
You know uh power 
Not power but just like personnel there cause at this point if you just took everybody out I think that’d be that’d be almost as bad as when we all went in there 
But uh I think you have to kinda start to uh loosen your grip 

Oh yeah sure 
I mean it 
Last election there was a 
I think it was 65% of people voted upon moral issues 
Having to do with abortion 
Uh stem cell research 
You know things that touched the Christian heart of our country 
And then then you have uh 
And then the next 25% voted upon the war and there’s all these other issues in terms of taxes and uh 
And uh school boards 
Uh school a systems and 
You know there’s a thousand different issues 
It seems like there’s only one 
The international issue and then there’s two domestic issues and there all 
They all basically revolve around the same like conservative liberal split 
There’s 
Like its deeper dividing our country 

And uh 
I think 
I think in terms of the red and blue I don’t think we’re ever gonna really solve 
Um 
Solve the whole Iraq problem until the the red and blue states kind of come together here cause otherwise its just gonna be the same 
Uh the same people will be elected and the same the same uh 
The same President type person is gonna keep keep people in Iraq 
It could be the republicans run the power then I can’t seem him taking 8 years of Bush’s progress or stepping back 
Or backwards progress or whatever out of Iraq 
You know 

So I think maybe change is the best way here 

Um 
Uh I mean not really 
I don’t 
I don’t really know uh 
I don’t really know how where to start I suppose 
I think a good start would be to start to back out of Iraq but then 
Then once you can 
Once we look closer here 
You know at our own country 
Um 
I guess the changes that I would like to see start to make first 
Is that kinda the question 

Um 
I mean what should I just throw in 
Um well 
Um 
I think the whole abortion stance 
I mean the whole abortion whatever it is 
The issue has to be made into a um 
I think it should be a state selected issue as opposed to a opposed to a federal issue 
I think that would be something that would be a nice start because 
I don’t think anyone is ever going to see eye to eye 
In certain states the populations so dense with people who are religiously opposed that it it would offend people to to legalize abortion and in certain other states you have such high intercity populations that in many ways um 
You’d be doing an injustice to the women who are trying to get uh 
The uh back alley abortions and so forth and the black market as opposed to giving them the legal opportunity 

So yeah that’s its own topic 

No 
Not at all
