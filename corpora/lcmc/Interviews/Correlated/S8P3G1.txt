Uh
I really don’t feel like 
It’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal
I think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state
It’s a clear
It’s a clear
Uh
It’s
Clearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it
Trying to enforce any kind of power over it 
Would really be in defiance of what has already been said
And written in stone in the constitution 
So 
Uh
In terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another
Because as we can see most of the Catholics
Uh
Catholics are and Christians are really against it
And don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas 
But um 
I don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal
And legal

Uh
Well separation of church and state is pretty much 
Uh like been a key aspect of the constitution
And what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States
And even though they did plan on making an amendment
I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong
And just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there
And plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment
Probably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government
So I don’t feel that’s its right at all
In that aspect 

Uh
No I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue
I don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment
Except that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic
And
As I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion
So I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this
Not for the president
Or anybody in government in particular
And there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it
Because I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else 
If anything
It could possibly boost it I think by 
I don’t know how but
I think it might have better impact on the society 
Society than it would not

Umm
Not quite
I think I pretty much said it all
