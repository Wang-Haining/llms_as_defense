I think that gay marriage should be legalized 
Because 
Well basically there’s not a good reason not to 
Um 
Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family 
But 
It’s so different 
And 
There’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same 
It’s just 
It’s like two different sides of the same coin 
Um 
Heads will never be tails 
But 
It’s like the same thing 
And 
Um 
Well there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it 
Like 
Property taxes and the whole health care thing where 
Um 
Your primary or your 
I don’t want to say next of kin 

‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is 
But 
If you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick 
And 
Can’t visit 
‘Cause they’re not technically family 

And 
I think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone 
And 
A lot of scientific studies have been done 
Because 
It’s kind of a hot topic these days 
And 
Homosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success 
They have the same 
Um 
Factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do 

It’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing 
And 
I think where a lot of people like get hung up on is 
Um 
Homosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church 
They’re asking for a marriage certificate 
A legal document provided by the government 

And 
If there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue 
Because 
I can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing 
But 
In a legal sense 
If you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage 

It’s like segregation separate but unequal 

Yeah 
They are 
They’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that 
And 
People worry about like adoption issues 
And 
Community issues 
Like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community 

And 
Especially about 
Um 
Children of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society 
And 
Whether or not they’ll 
Um 
Be influenced by their parent’s 
Um 
Sexual orientation choices or not 
But 
Well again it’s kind of new and stuff 
But 
It’s kind of hard to say 
I’m not sure about the children aspect 
About adoption 
Because 
I think the main drawback to that is 
Um 
How children get treated by their peers 
And 
By other adults in society 

Like in New York City I know they 
Um 
They have special schools for children of gay parents 
Because 
In public schools in New York City they get like beaten up 

And 
Stuff like that 
Parents protest to get the child removed from their school 
And 
It’s just a kid 
I mean 
They’re gonna have the same points of views and everything 
Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples 

And 
So 
They can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to 
I mean it’s just about personality choices 

I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue 
Making gay marriage legal in every state 
I think the amendment should just be the opposite 

But 
Well I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion 

Well 
His um 
His take on gay marriage actually um 
I think it goes along with his take on abortion 
And 
Stem cell research which 
Um 
I think most of the reasons 
I’m not sure about this 
Because 
Honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot 
But 
Most of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons 
And 
Morality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable 
But 
It definitely differs from person to person 
And 
To embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and 
Um 
Morality concepts of all the rest is unethical 
To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account 
To go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy 
Considering I mean about 
Um 
Under god in the pledge of allegiance 
And 
How people are so opposed to that 
But 
Yet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country 

Um 
Just one 
Lots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged 
And 
The gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents 
Or 
Just a personality defect 

And 
That is also not a good reason 
Because 
The American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is 
And 
If people listened to 
Um 
Institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects 

Instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends 
And 
Maybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church 
Then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently 

Nope
