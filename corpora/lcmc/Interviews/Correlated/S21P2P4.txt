Um 
I don’t think that is an invasion of privacy because 
Um 
I mean if this was posted on 
Like one of his 
Maybe like a screen name or something like that I would maybe think it was an invasion of privacy 
But Myspace is like a totally public website where anyone can view it 
It’s not even like Facebook where you supposedly have to have a college email address to have one 
Um 
So I definitely don’t think that it’s an invasion of privacy because it’s a public website where anyone can have access to it 
Um 
And especially if it’s gonna prevent something like that 
Then I don’t see how anyone could think it was an invasion of privacy 
Cause that’s such a big deal 
And it was something so small that prevented something that could be like so disastrous 
So I mean like I don’t think that was an invasion of privacy at all 
It’s just because anyone could have one 
Um 
It like 
Facebook you have to have a college email address and so at least there’s like a set community I guess you could say 
Like with Myspace it’s like anyone of any age could have a Myspace 
And post anything on it that they want 
And if people are seeing that someone’s posting threats or like something like that 
I don’t see why they can’t report that or look further into it 
I mean if this kid didn’t want anyone to see that he shouldn’t have posted in on his Myspace 
I didn’t know why he would have 
Um 
So 
And even like just 
I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy 
Cause it’s nothing private 
I don’t think they went into his email or anything like that 
Something that is private 
So 
I mean like phone tapping and stuff like that 
Like I would see how that is an invasion of privacy 
But I think that 
You have to trust that the government or whoever’s doing it is doing it is for a reason 
And there’s like a legit I guess reason that they would do that 
Like they’re suspecting you of something or anything like that 
And if you have nothing to hide I don’t see why that would be such a big deal 
Especially if it could prevent these terrorist attacks that we’ve been having or anything like that 
So 
I don’t 
I don’t see a reason why people should get upset about it 
Um 
Personally I don’t 
I don’t think there should be a line drawn if there’s a reason that they 
Like I said if they have a reason that they should be looking into this student’s business I don’t see a reason why they shouldn’t or a reason why they can’t 
Especially if that kid is enrolled in their institution and they’re just trying to protect it 
Especially if they didn’t have a good reason for looking on his Myspace or whatever like 
Just like at student life here if they don’t have a good reason for looking on someone’s Facebook or anything like that 
I think that’s an invasion of privacy 
But if that’s a good reason I don’t see why they can’t do it or they shouldn’t be allowed to 
If it could prevent something like a school shooting 
Nope 
Ok
