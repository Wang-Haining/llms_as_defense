Um
I don’t think that marijuana should be legalized in
Um
Even in small forms
Uh
The only way that I think that marijuana should be legalized is for medical uses

And in that case that’s not really a law that has to be done
It’s just the doctor can prescribe it to you

So I don’t think that there is any reason for people over 21 to have it
Even in small quantities. 

Um
Sure
I just don’t think
I mean
Um
Its
Uh
A very harmful drug to you especially when people get like addicted to it
And I just don’t think there’s
Uh
Any reason for people to
For that to be legal
Uh 
They’ve 
Um
Had problems
They didn’t want to legalize it before so I don’t
I don’t understand why even in small quantities it should be legal


Um
The only positive that I could possibly see is that the people who
Uh
Were using for medical uses it would probably be easier for them to have it and it would be less of a problem
But the people who are using it now for medical reasons
I don’t think they would have much of a problem
So
So yeah that’s

Um
Well I know they use it for cancer patients if they 
Um
To make them feel better

So I don’t know much about it


Um no
I don’t think
I think that it’s on a higher scale 
I don’t think it should be legal

Um
I just don’t really approve of it
I don’t really like that 
Um
I don’t really like the smell of it
I don’t really like it
So I don’t think that it should be legal

No
 

No
