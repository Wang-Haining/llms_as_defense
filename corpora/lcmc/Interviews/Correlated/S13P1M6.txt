Hm 
I don’t think it’s good 
Um 

I think 
I actually had not heard of that before but it’s only in Denver 
That’s it 

Ok 
Um 
I just think that 
Um 
I mean supposedly there’s not really 
Like it’s not addicted 
Addictive or anything but 
Um 
So then I guess the 
Why people would say it would be ok would just be like thinking of it like just a recreational drug and like alcohol or something 
But 
Um 
Are they 
Is it legalized like for medicinal purposes or just recreational 

Personal use ok 
Um 
I guess I don’t really have a reason why I just 
I would just be against it 
Um 
I think that 

Excuse me 

Um 
I think that if it if it’s allowed in like small amounts that 
I mean how are they really gonna control that and I think it’s just gonna like spread even more and then it’s gonna go to other places where it’s not legal and 
I mean not that its not anywhere it’s not legal now but 
Um 
I think it’s also strange that it could be allowed in like one city so 
You know are you allowed to smoke in Denver but your not allowed to smoke in the next town over 
Like that just seems really strange 
Um 
That one city could say that it’s ok 
Um 
And 
I don’t know 
I mean if people are like smoking and then like going to work then 
I don’t know that just seems a little bit strange to me 
Um 
Um 

Ok 
Um 
I don’t really know from personal experience but 
Um 
I would say 
I mean from people that I have witnessed 
Um 
I 
I think that they’re pretty similar 
Um 
I guess it’s not like 
I mean if people are like 
Would be could be driving and I don’t think that 
I mean it’s like an issue with like alcohol now if that’s legal but then people abuse it and 
You know like 
Drunk driving 
Um 
Accidents 
Lives are lost and if you allow people who are 
You know intoxicated whether they’re drunk or high 
I think that if they’re just like out in the world interacting with completely sober and clean people then 
I don’t know 
There’s potential that lives could be lost 

Um 
No 
Sorry
