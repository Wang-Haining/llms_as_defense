Um 
Yes I do think it is an issue to a certain extent probably not to the same extent it was 50 years ago 
But I think that our culture is kind of distended from a lot of ingrained patriarchal notions 
Um 
And we still very much have those conceptions with us to a certain extent and I think they’re evolutionary 
Um 
In a way 
But I think that they are kind of outdated and outmoded and I think that we need to move past them 
Um 
I don’t know what are you looking for in particular like 
Um 

Um 
I think the 
Uh 
Linguistic efforts of the feminists from like the late 60s early 70s are kind of interesting by which they were trying to deconstruct 
Um 
The idea of those binary oppositions inherent in language by which we prefer 
Um 
Terms that connote masculinity over terms that connote femininity like human like 
Uh mankind instead of humankind or the preference for male pronouns when giving generic examples things like that 
I think 
Despite what a lot of people protest that that’s just silly but it seems to me that those kinds of things really do prejudice people in a subliminal level and I think that really its going to be a matter of changing people’s minds at a very basic level in order to fight gender discrimination 

Sometimes 
Um 
There’s a lot of buzz about reversed discrimination among like right 
Uh right wing conservatives 
And people like that 
Um 
I suppose there’s a small amount of truth to that 
I think its possible that deserving men could be overlooked for positions in certain circumstances 
Um 
Just because employers want to make it appear that they’re not gender discriminating against females 
But I think that that’s probably a very small percentage of cases 

Um 
I don’t know 
From my personal experience I don’t think I have ever experienced gender discrimination as a male 
And I know females who have at least 
Um 
So while I think that probably does happen in some places and at certain times I just don’t see it being that large of an issue for males 

Uh 
Not in particular 
No
