Yeah I do feel that gender
Uh
Discrimination is still an issue especially when it comes into the workplace
You don’t see as many women as there should be going out and getting jobs
Because people still have that
Uh
Extremely conservative mindset that women belong in the house
And I think that’s more or less women aren’t
Uh allowed to go out in to workplace
I think that it’s not more or less that women aren’t 
Uh
Allowed to go out into the workplace
I think that it’s just the continuation of that mindset
And the roles that people see in the homes
And the way children are growing up 
And they see their mother always cooking staying at home
There’s still a bunch of stay at home moms that are just home all day
And the children think of it that way
So they grow up with that mindset
And they feel that they don’t really
Think to themselves
That ok this is how it should be
But it just kind of grows with them as they grow older
And it’s more of a subconscious
Uh
Idea for them
And what I think could change this
I think that if people were to
Uh
Probably try and just change themselves in the household
Rather than going out into the streets
And trying to force everybody to change their minds
Because this force I believe just kind of has a negative impact on people in general
If you try to force someone to do something
You’re just going to be creating more tensions than are really necessary
Especially when it comes to gender discrimination
Or any kind of discrimination in general
Because if you’re trying to force someone to change
People are just going to begin to look at the opposite sex
Or opposite race
Or whatever it may be 
As more of a negative light because you are trying to force it on them
Whereas if it’s more of a mutual decision
Maybe
Uh
I don’t know
Through just 
Uh
If you just were to let the mindsets change over time
Maybe not a really long period of time
But just let it evolve 
And eventually we can probably see it deteriorate to the point where it is virtually nonexistent

Uh
I wouldn’t
Maybe if reverse discrimination 
When people are trying to 
Uh
Uh 
Hire more women or something
And especially when it comes to jobs like nursing
And all of that
You don’t typically see men in those fields
So I think that there might be some discrimination in there 
But I don’t think that it’s really that much
Not as high of a percentage as it is for women
And I don’t really see that discrimination against men as a problem that is really in existence
I think that it is more of the other way around

Uh
Because
I don’t know
You typically see men being able to do whatever they want 
I mean
Most men don’t really have to worry about
Have their employers going to have to pay them half the pay that they would pay a woman 
Because I don’t know 
Most companies
And any kind of business that discriminates against gender
Or a specific gender
It’s usually toward women
So men don’t really have to worry about that too much
And I feel like sometimes they take advantage of that 
And kind of use that to enforce
Or develop beliefs like that they’re a man
So they’re kind of in a higher up position 
I don’t see it really
Much a problem
As it is to
Uh
For women

Uh no
