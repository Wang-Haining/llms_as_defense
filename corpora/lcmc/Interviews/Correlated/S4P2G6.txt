I think gay marriage should be legalized in all states because 
Um 
If two people love each other 
You know 
You should let them get married 
I don’t really see any downside to letting them get married 
They’re not 
They’re not directly hurting anyone 
They just want to have the freedom that other heterosexual people do 
And 
Its 
Being homosexual is 
It’s a biological thing 
There’s no control over it 
It’s just what happens and to deny someone the right to marry 
I just think its 
It’s kind of barbaric 

Yeah um 
It’s not like you’re brought up or taught to be gay 
It’s just 
Its something that you don’t even think about 
It’s just you’re attracted to the same sex 
Um 
I have a gay uncle 
And 
I mean he’s just like everybody else except that he’s attracted to men 
And 
We shouldn’t put fault on people for being gay 
It’s just 
It’s what happens 
It’s natural and it’s just like having brown hair versus blonde hair or being short versus tall 
It’s just 
There’s nothing wrong about it  

I think the federal government should allow gay marriage 
For the reasons I’ve just stated 
Um 
Like I said its not 
Its not going to hurt anyone 
It can only help people 
Who love each other 
And 
I think part of the reason is that the Catholic Church gets involved and says that 
You know 
Its not natural to be gay and we shouldn’t let gay people be together 
Like I think 
We’ve got to get rid of that image of 
Being gay as bad cause its not 

Sure 
Um 
(pause) 
Uh 
(pause) 
Hmm 

Ok 
Um 
I don’t 
I don’t think its right for the federal government to 
To like ban progress 
You know what I mean 
I think it’s a step backwards 
But if they 
If they supported gay marriage then that would be progressive 
It would 
I don’t know 
In this day and age people are more open 
And uh 
There’s nothing to be afraid of 
Just accept people for who they are 
And move on 
There’s no reason to get upset because someone’s gay and wants to marry another gay person 

Nope
