Um 
I actually feel kind of mixed about this cause I was always taught that marijuana is really, really bad for you and that you shouldn’t ever smoke it or have anything to do with it 
But, as I’m learning more about it 
I’m finding out that it’s in a way 
I’m not gonna say like safer than alcohol 
But, maybe it’s less addictive as alcohol is 
And um  
I know that there is like a city in 
Um 
Oh I know Amsterdam 
I’m pretty sure it’s Amsterdam has legalization of marijuana 
And it actually seems to me through the study that they’re doing that the users are actually going down because it is legal 
And that it’s monitored so it’s pure versus having like a bunch of pesticides or like rat poison stuck in with it 
Or other things that could be addictive to the drug 
And I know that a lot that has to do with the controversy about marijuana has to do with that it is illegal 
There is a lot of drug wars going around and there’s a lot of killings and I feel like with this study going on in Denver 
Maybe if they find that if it’s being monitored 
It could actually be to the U.S.’s benefit because I know with cigarette smoking that’s really addictive and it’s being monitored though 
So the country’s actually making a profit off of it 
There’s no like drug wars going on about cigarettes and people aren’t dying 
And perhaps if 
Um 
It is monitored than the government can make more money off of it, regulate what’s put into it, and I know South America is a big provider of marijuana 
And there’s a lot of 
Um drug lords and killings going down there 
And if it’s taken away and it’s legal then their jobs are gonna disappear and hopefully it’ll benefit society 
And I also feel that if they do in the long run find that it’s better to legalize it then they have laws put into place on like how, when and where you can use the drug just like with alcohol 
Like I feel like it should be treated exactly like alcohol is 
That you should not be like seen on the streets randomly just like smoking pot 
And like not everyone’s gonna want to get your second hand smoke of that 
And I feel that you shouldn’t be able to drive high 
And that there should be tests that you can run that you can like 
I don’t know 
I know with like alcohol there’s like the blow test that you can do and they can measure your levels 
Perhaps with something for marijuana where they can measure your levels if you’re suspected of being high and you’re driving 
Because that’s really dangerous 
And um 
I don’t think that they should be allowed to be in restaurants or bars and smoke pot 
I feel like if you want to do that 
It’s something that you should do on your own time, in your own like private environment 
So, I feel like there should be laws put into place if it is to be legalized 
Um 
I’m kind of like torn on the [inaudible] of whether I feel like it should be legal or not because I personally would never want to use or have a desire to use it and I want to do more research to see if I feel that it has the same effects as alcohol 
Or if it’s worse 
Or if it’s better 
Cause I know that there are some studies that say that it’s safer 
Um 
Cause I know alcohol in the long run 
You can get addicted to it and get cirrhosis of the liver 
Um 
I’m not sure 
Like people claim that marijuana is not addictive 
But, I’m not really positive that that’s true 
And I just know that from people that I’m friends with who do use it 
It seems to me that the more often they use it 
The less brain cells they have in the long run 
So 
But then again that could also be their personality and their 
I guess their way of saying oh I don’t really care so 
I’ll just act this way cause it’s who I am so  
I’m not really sure if I could say one way or the other if I think that it should be legalized until I do more research on the entire aspect 
Um not really 
Ok
