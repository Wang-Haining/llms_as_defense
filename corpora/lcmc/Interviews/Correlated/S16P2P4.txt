Do I think what? 
Um 
I think it’s an invasion of privacy when the school prowls around 
Um and 
Basically filters through all of its students’ Myspaces 
But I think that if people see something like that on a student’s Myspace then they have a duty to report it 
And once it’s reported, I think it’s certainly not an invasion of privacy for them to look at it 
I mean 
I think that the community should be the eyes and ears cause once the school starts prowling around and all that then they’re gonna see a whole lot of things about the students’ personal lives that 
I mean I guess you could use the whole argument that Myspace is a public domain cause it’s on the internet 
Um 
So I guess realistically and legally it’s not really an invasion of privacy 
Um 
Especially because the student has the option on Myspace to make their profile private 
Um 
But yeah 
Well yeah 
As far as I know on all of the social networking sites every participant has the option to make their information private 
Um 
I mean cause the internet is the public domain so whatever they posted up there 
They can’t really call it an invasion of privacy if someone then goes and looks at it 
Um 
I think the invasion of privacy would just be more of a thing that people might complain about if the school was to go prowling around on their Myspace 
Cause a lot of people put up like all sorts of poetry and things like that that they consider to be kinda personal 
But it is kind of a flip flop thing to consider something to be really personal when it’s posted on your Myspace because Myspace is a public domain 
So I mean the school isn’t really in the wrong to go prowling around cause they have kind of a compelling interest for students’ safety 
But um I mean 
I think that if people see those kinds of things then they should report them and then the school should look at it 
Uh 
You know to tell you the truth I think there’s a lot of deference to the school district on that matter 
Um 
Because you know as much as it’s not really 
You know 
Overly respectful of students’ privacy for the school to 
Uh 
To go prowling around you know I 
I can’t really bring myself to say that the school would be legally in the wrong for prowling around 
Especially if the student didn’t make their profile public 
So I guess the school has the right to do what it wants 
Um 
But I know that Loyola for instance doesn’t go prowling around on 
Uh 
The Facebook 
Reason being that when 
I mean the people who do judicial student life 
Whenever they witness something that’s wrong 
Uh 
One of the duties of their job is they are compelled to report it or to document it 
Um 
And they have to or else they lose their jobs 
And uh 
So if they go around on the Facebook they may be looking for one thing 
For sexual harassment 
And then they see a picture of ten kids who are freshman drinking beers 
Um 
So now they have to write those ten kids up for drinking beers 
And so that’s just not something that they want to go into 
It’s a little bit of a different situation 
But I mean I think the school pretty much has the right to do what it wants though 
Well yeah 
I mean that’s 
That’s good that they were able to do that 
Um and 
I mean 
As much as a lot of people 
I mean it’s legitimate for someone to feel that’s that is an invasion of their privacy 
But it’s really not legitimized I think with any legal bases because it’s the public domain 
Um 
No
