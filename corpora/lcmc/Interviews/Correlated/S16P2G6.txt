I think if uh 
If two people love each other they should be allowed to have the legal benefits of marriage 
Namely they should be allowed to visit each other in the hospital 
Um 
They should be allowed to file jointly on their tax returns and 
Um 
You know 
And combine their assets legally 
You know 
Buy a house together, cosign a mortgage 
I mean a lot of things that are typically reserved for spouses 
I don’t think it’s fair to deny those to homosexual couples 
Now at the same time if you call it marriage then you’re gonna piss off 
You know a lot of people for whom marriage is a symbol which is integral into their lifestyle and their beliefs 
And you know they’ll find that offensive 
So 
I think a civil union is a very 
Is a very, very good compromise 
And I think for homosexual people to say that a civil union isn’t good enough 
You know if 
If like a civil union has all those legal benefits then for homosexual .
For homosexuals to say that a civil union isn’t good enough is just being selfish and refusing to compromise 
And for uh you know pro-marriage for between a man and a woman sort of religious people to say that a civil union isn’t good enough 
Well then that’s just being selfish 
Um 
I mean I think it’s a perfectly good compromise 
I mean who cares if you call it marriage? 
Whatever 
But um 
I mean if two people really do love each other 
And I believe that’s possible for that to happen without crossing a gender line well then 
I mean yeah let em live together 
Let them file their taxes together 
And you know 
No harm done 
Especially when everyone’s trying to be so pro-marriage now when there’s this whole pro-marriage, pro-family movement 
Which is good 
I mean in all sorts of places 
I mean in Baltimore there are billboards up 
Uh there’s one in Govan’s 
There’s one in Park Heights 
I saw a couple in West Baltimore 
With this big campaign called marriage works and it has a like a website, an 800 number, and you can get to counseling and all sorts of stuff like that 
And I mean 
So I mean civil union 
Yeah 
It’s fair 
It would never, never, never pass 
It was a political move that he made just to appease a lot of his support base 
And that is absolutely clear 
I mean do you really 
I mean think about what has to happen for a Constitutional Amendment to pass 
It has to be passed in Congress 
I believe two thirds 
And then it has to be ratified by the states individually 
That means that every single state would have to 
Would have to ratify that Constitutional Amendment 
And the handful of states or at least 
And you know 
That would create a sort of a legal crisis 
Um 
The likes of which I don’t think we’ve really seen since the civil war or since the equal rights amendment 
Um 
And it would never pass 
And so therefore as a project 
As a legislator to take on a project that you know is absolutely unfathomably hopeless 
Uh then 
I mean if you take on that type of project 
Well then it’s obvious that you’re motivations can’t be serious 
I mean he is smart guy 
So I mean he 
I mean he wouldn’t waste his time on that 
Um 
But it was just to appease a lot of this support base that wanted to feel 
Because I mean a lot of people feel very strong in their beliefs 
And you know you have to be very respectful of that 
And a lot of people were saying oh well you know we don’t want this to happen 
And so I mean President Bush doesn’t really have to power to enact legislation per say beyond executive orders and federalizing national guards and that sort of thing 
I mean he can’t really write federal statutes 
That’s Congress’s job 
So I mean he’s like, yeah I’m gonna propose this amendment 
And I mean it would never happen 
I think he just wanted it on his record that he opposed it 
You know that he wanted to stand up and say, well this is want them to believe so that then the history books can say look at President Bush 
Oh yeah well he was against gay marriage and uh you know 
Um 
I think 
I mean when you’re talking about something like this you could 
I suppose that you could either way 
Either way you could argue this either way 
And I would tend to lean towards the side of 
Uh 
Even though marriages only happen in one state, they’re effective in all fifty states 
Um 
And the way that we’re progressing now is towards a sort of polarization of the states themselves where some states say yes and some states say no 
So then you have people 
So then I mean if you’re gonna end up with people eloping or flying half way across the country just to get married 
Well then 
Maybe the federal government could do something about it 
But then if the federal government did do something about it 
States like Utah would just refuse to comply and Texas would probably just refuse to comply 
And um 
So 
I mean 
Maybe it is better decided by the courts in the states 
But if the federal government doesn’t get involved then all federal legislatures and elected officials 
You know all three branches have to stop using the term activist judges 
Because if they aren’t gonna step in 
Well then those activist judges aren’t really activist judges 
They’re the ones who are just stepping up and taking the function that the federal government is deferring to them 
And just because they disagree with one particular point of view doesn’t necessarily make them activists  
I mean they’re judges 
It’s their job to decide 
You know 
These types of things and if a case like that comes up and if a homosexual couple is suing the state and has a compelling argument 
I mean and it has worked in other jurisdictions and that gives you know some persuasive jurisdiction then if a judge is San Francisco or one in Boston or a city magistrate in San Francisco or Boston says go ahead and do it well then 
Unless the federal government is going to enact a sweeping legislation 
Well then, that’s going to go ahead and happen 
I mean and I think that the Supreme Court does not want a landmark case like this yet 
I mean the issue will have to develop a lot more 
Um 
Before it really comes to a head 
And once it comes to a head then the Supreme Court will step in 
But until then I don’t think so 
I mean if you look at landmark cases like 
Um 
Like Runner versus Ballinger or Brown versus Board of Education is a good one 
You know Shaw versus Reno or any of these you know 
It took a while for them to step in for these until the problem came to a head and it became compelling for them to do so 
Especially with this Chief Justice 
I mean he doesn’t really 
This Supreme Court has heard fewer cases than any Supreme Court in I think since the Warren Court I believe 
And so 
He’s not gonna step into til he has to 
But for now I guess it’s not bad 
It can be left in the hands of the states 
Uh 
No
