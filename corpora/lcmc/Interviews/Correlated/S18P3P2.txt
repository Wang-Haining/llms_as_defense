No 

Because 
Anything you put on the internet 
Or 
Any public message you send out should be tracked 
Because 
You’re making the conscious decision to like post something on the internet 
And 
You should realize that with the technology can always be traced back to you 
No matter how private 
No matter how private people may say their websites are 
And 
It’s just like taking out an ad in the paper 
If you put something up for other people to learn who you are you have to use discretion on what you want everyone else to find out about you 

Well 
Because 
It’s there’s people searching the internet for 
Like 
The worst people searching the internet are searching to like post 
Like 
Scams 
And 
Viruses 
And 
Trojans 
And 
Other things to sell money 
Put adware on computers 
And 
So 
There’s all these spiders 
And 
There’s all these robots that search the webpages 
And 
They just do that as part of their daily routine 
And 
Of course the government is going to have some of those as well 
And 
You don’t know who is just like having these 
Who’s collecting the data randomly 
Not to like specifically towards you 
But 
There’s plenty of people that just collect random data in ways you don’t even know about on the internet 

Um 
Anything that could be 
Anything that they could have access to without 
Actually that’s part of the question 
Um 
Anything that they could have access to without any 
Like authority power 
Authority 
I don’t know how to phrase that 

Um 
Just anything anything that’s public enough where they could see it without going out of their way to specifically target one or another student 

One student specifically 

Yeah like 
Um 
If they just wanted to do a general sweep of whatever 
Like 
Social utility website there is 
Like 
Facebook or Myspace 
And 
They check everyone’s page without 
Like 
Actually using like going to their house 
And looking at what websites they visited 
Or 
Anything like that 
Just anything that they post in the public 
That’s public domain 
I really don’t know how to like nail that down 

Um 
No
