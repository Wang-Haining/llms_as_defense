Ok 
Lets see 
Gay marriage 
I know last week I remember reading in the paper that New Jersey 
Uh the New Jersey Supreme Court 
Um 
Legalized 
Well gave equal rights to gay couples 
The same rights as heterosexual couples although they left 
They left the what to call it 
The name to uh 
To the legislator cause they didn’t 
Whether to call it a civil union or an actual marriage 
I know Massachusetts 
Um 
They allow gay marriage 
They call it marriage and I think in Vermont its called civil union 
So its 
So I think those are the only states 
So there 
So there obviously in the minority for allowing 
Ah gay couples to have the same rights as heterosexual couples 

Um 
I myself am not against  
Um 
People being gay and I think that 
That gay couples should have 
Have the same rights as heterosexual couples 
They should be able to adopt children and be given health benefits and all 
All the rights that are 
That are um 
Heterosexual couples are entitled to 
Um 
And I guess 
I guess I’m not quite sure whether that should be called marriage 

I know that’s a big issue 
I know there were 
There’s been talk about an amendment to ban gay marriage and things like that 

Which 
Um 
I’m not sure I haven’t quite made up my mind about that yet 
But I’m definitely in favor of civil unions at least because they should have the same rights because its 
Its 
I mean often gay couples function better then 
Then ah 
Regular heterosexual marriages and 

And um 
So I think that 
I think that New Jersey and Vermont have the right idea 
Um 
And then I guess there’s also a question of whether its 
Its going back to the amendment whether it’s something that should be decided by the national government or should 
Keep developing in each individual state 
And um 
I’m not really sure about that either 

Um 
I don’t think that there should be a a ban on gay marriage and right now I think that the way its going state by state is fine 
I think that’s a 
That’s a good way to deal with it right now 
I think that the federal government has too many other things that they need to worry about 
Um 
Rather then this issue 
So 
But I would be against at ban on gay marriage 

Um 
Let’s see 
Is there anything else 

Um 
(pause) 
I just 
I just think that it 
That um 
Its 
You know it’s a life style that many people 
Um 
Are adopting today and that when you 
When gay couples don’t have the same rights as as heterosexual couples there 
There’s a lot of 
There can be a lot of problems as a result 
Legal problems and things like that or 
Um 
And 
And so I just think that they should be given the same rights and privileges as 

As heterosexual couples 

I mean 
The marriage statistics in the country 
I think less then 50% of 
Err well 
I think more then 50% of marriages end in divorce in this country now 
And um 
So 
Um 
So its not 
It’s not even like marriage is such a sacred thing any more 
It doesn’t seem like to many people so I wonder why there’s such a great concern or 
Um 
Or a great support around not allowing 
Um 
Marriage between two gay people when it seems that the majority of the country doesn’t really care for or respect the institution much anymore anyway 
I think that’s interesting 

Oh 
Um 
Well let’s see 
There um 
Oh New Jersey um 
Because they’re allowing equal rights which is the most important thing and whether 
Whether 
What to call it isn’t as much an issue I think it’s more a matter of principle for people and 
In um 
In Massachusetts they 
It’s actual just defined as marriage 
Um 
Which I’m 
I actual don’t think I have a problem with that and um 
Well in Vermont to it’s a 
Its civil unions 
So um 
I think ah 
That 
I think that I’m in support of that 

Yeah 

Um 
I think that’s it
