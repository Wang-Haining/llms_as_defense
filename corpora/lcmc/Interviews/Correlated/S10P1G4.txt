Um 
Let’s see 
I’m I’m for um gay marriage 
I always have been 
Um 
I really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh 
And its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control 
Um 
Due to their control 
I think it’s its kinda of inhumane 
And uh 
I’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage 

Uh I don’t think there’s any 
I I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its 
You it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level 
Um 
You know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not 
You know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to 
Um 
But they they function the same way that any other family would 
You know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that 
Um 
With you know 
Bush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to 
I think its 
I think it’s kind of ridiculous 

Sure yeah 
I mean I think 
I mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain 
Its something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual 
As opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it 
So that would be the biological side opposed to sociological 

Um 
Well other other then 
I guess the obvious it’s you know in this 
I think maybe cause marriage is something that 
If a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know 
Uh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to 
Um 
As opposed to public domain and um 
National 
Um federal domain 

Uh no 
No
