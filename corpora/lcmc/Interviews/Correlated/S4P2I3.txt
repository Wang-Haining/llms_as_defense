Um 
Well war is always a bad thing 
But I feel that its 
Its sometimes necessary 
And in this case I think it was necessary 
Uh 
Because 
First of all Saddam Hussein is no longer in power and he was always a dangerous figure 
If not right then then in the future he would be 
That’s just the way he was 
And so now he’s gone and the world is safer 
Um 
(pause) 
And 
I know that it does cost American lives but that’s that’s just the way things are 
It sounds cold to say that but 
You know 
If you don’t have a military force 
Then  you just wouldn’t have power 

Sure 
Um 
Like I think people look back and use hindsight to justify their their opinions on the war 

Like with all the insurgents 
And that sort of thing 
But I think five – ten years down the road Iraq will be that much better off because we intervened  and removed Saddam 

I don’t think it’s a question of whether it should continue 
Um 
We shouldn’t leave 
You know 
The country while its still in the beginning stages of development 
We’ve got to get the Iraqis back on their feet so to speak before we leave 

Uh 
Sure 
Like Iraq right now they don’t have a very powerful military force or police force 
And 
But were training them 
And were training them 
You know as we train other Americans 
So they’re
So they’re getting the best training in the world and in the future they will be able to support themselves and defend themselves from insurgents and 
And that sort of thing 

Nope
