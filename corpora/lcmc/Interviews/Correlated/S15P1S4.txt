Um 
Yes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States 
Um 
And it 
Not only with women though 
I feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with 
Um 
I mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man 
Just cause of how society has been raised for so long 
And so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach 
And they have all of the qualifications for it 
But maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world 
And um 
I guess the same thing goes for men though 
And like other industries like fashion or 
Um being a parent at home 
It’s really uncommon 
Um 
To have a parent staying at home who’s the male 
And um 
A lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working 
You should be the money maker of your family 
Why are you staying at home? 
And it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job 
And like it’s working out fine for them 
But society looks down upon that 
And then in the fashion industry 
Um 
A lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight 
I don’t know if that really makes sense 
But I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion 
Um 
Like I guess have different styles of life 
And so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry 
People will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman 
Like you don’t really don’t know what our case is like 
Like these other guys 
And so 
Depending on like what field of work you’re in 
I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. 
Um 
To change it is kind of more difficult because you 
Society like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds 
But change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process 
But it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more 
And just as men who are stay at home Dads 
It’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works 
And um 
Then for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff 
And so they do know like where I’m coming from 
So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically 
Are stereotyped against by not being too pushy 
But um saying like the qualities of them 
Because if you force it people are going to resist 
And I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that 
So I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist 
And we’ve come a long ways and change takes time 
Yes 
Um 
Well I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from 
Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself 
Like you work your way up into a CEO job 
Even though you might not have the best grammar in the world and 
Or even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world 
Other men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right 
So 
Yeah 
So like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you 
And like from gender to gender 
And I don’t know 
I guess that’d be another example 
Um 
Not really
