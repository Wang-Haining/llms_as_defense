Um 
I do not think it was an invasion of policy 
Because 
With a website like Myspace that’s something that anybody has access to on the world wide web 
It’s not really 
There’s no safeguard or security trying to keep people out 
The average person could go online and view those types of profiles and messages 
So 
I think in that sense it was not an invasion of privacy 
And 
Another issue to look at with that 
The whole privacy issue 
I don’t think it’s an invasion of privacy when the means are to restore security 
Or protect life 
I think that people who make a deal out of privacy rights coming from such an issue like that it’s pretty unjustified 
Just because their cause was to save a person’s life 
If it was maybe to get somebody suspended from school or some sort of lesser cause maybe privacy rights should have been brought into it 
But 
On a public something with public access where a life was in jeopardy I think it’s completely justified 

Yeah I mean since its on the internet 
Um 
I mean when compared to perhaps an email or a telephone conversation 
That’s something where you have an intended receiver 
Someone you intend to see that message 
But 
Myspace is pretty much an open forum 
Something where you can share information with all sorts of people around the world 
So 
I don’t think 
To bring up privacy rights in such a 
Through such channels of communication doesn’t really seem as justified 
Um 
As much so as if they were intercepting telephone calls or emails 
Like that’s something where you have a definite intended receiver 
And 
You’re talking through 
Um 
Communication channels that should be secure so that would bring up privacy issues 

Um 
I think they should draw the line 
I think it should have two criteria 
As I have mentioned what the channel of communication is 
And 
What it really pertains to in matters of 
You know 
Whether the student was drinking or they were going to commit a prank 
I don’t really think that merits breaking these 
Um 
These means of communication to try and get that information 
But 
When it brings into question other people’s safety 
Um 
That’s definitely something you have to consider when 
Um 
Looking through other means of communication 
Also whether or not it’s you know public or private 
To an extent it is a public 
I mean a private website 
But 
It’s displaying information for everybody so 

I think that’s it
