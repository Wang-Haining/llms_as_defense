Uh 
No I don’t feel it’s an invasion of privacy because he 
If he did in fact post a bulletin on Myspace I think he was kind of reaching out for some kind of public notice or trying to notify somebody that he was planning this 
So if someone were to go and tell the school officials or if the school officials even just found it themselves 
He obviously put it out there 
He put it on a public server so he’d 
He pretty much accepted the consequences the second that he did that 

Uh 
Well Myspace is a public server and many people can view it if you post a bulletin or anything your friends can view it any 
Even people who aren’t your friends can probably view it so by putting it there he kind of just put it in an open source so it would be like writing on the blackboard 
Writing on a blackboard like in a school somewhere that you were planning it so 
Really by investigating into that situation it wasn’t invading privacy because if there is a threat posted somewhere 
Especially somewhere in public I think its best to look into it rather then to just pass it off as just someone being 
I don’t know 
Someone just being really antsy or something 

I think that school officials have a tendency to assume different things about people based on their appearance or 
I don’t know anything else just the way they 
Like uh 
What kind of music they listen to and all of that stuff 
Or maybe what there interests are 
And I think that 
Uh 
This has a big impact 
Like a big 
School officials take this way to far sometimes 
They go 
Like I’ve seen uh 
I 
When I was in 9th grade I witnessed an event where one of the students in my school wrote up a hit list of different people in the school 
And the thing about the person is he didn’t really have any appearance that would lead people to believe that 
But I think that school officials do tend to look for like 
I don’t know 
Maybe different trends like Goth 
Like they have those Goth trends 
The emo trends and all of that 
And they kind of look out for that and see that as a sign as a possible school shooting 
And when they are to look into someone try to find out more about someone 
Uh 
Just based on their appearance 
I think that’s definitely invading their privacy because 
They have to learn to understand that people are different and people like to express themselves in different ways but just because they’re doing it in a certain way doesn’t mean that they’re planning any threats or anything of that nature 

Um 
In terms of uh the 
School officials 
No not really 
I think that they should try to mind their own business if its not a direct threat or if they don’t have any factual evidence to back it up 
So 

Alright
