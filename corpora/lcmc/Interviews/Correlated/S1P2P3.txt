Invasion of privacy on myspace bulletin
Um
I think that no matter
I think what you put on the internet you should know that anything you put on a website like myspace can be seen  by anyone who has access to a computer
So I think that 
Um
It’s not a violation of privacy rights
Um
Because you 
It’s something that you put out there on the internet when you know that everyone can see it
It’s something that your consciously putting on there knowing that other people can see it

Um
I think that it would be wrong for school officials to search myspace to look for trouble 
But if there is something that has come to their attention
Or if they happen to see that there is something especially like as important as a school shooting
Um
That I don’t think it’s a violation of privacy
Because its
You are putting the information out there to be seen


Um
I think that
If they 
Um 
If someone tells them that they
That they see something
That it should be investigate
But I don’t think that they should go out looking for it

Um 
Sure
If the school officials are just
I don’t really think that any school officials are going to be spending their time searching the internet
To look for 
To get children in trouble
But if 
Um
It goes along the same with 
Um
Other websites and if you’re putting something on a website and someone else does see and thinks that it should be brought to the attention of someone else once that is stated than I think they have the right to do whatever they want
Because it’s information that’s put out to the public

Um

No
