Um 
No I don’t feel as though they should at all 
Um 
I am myself a Roman Catholic 
Uh 
So 
I guess you could say I’m a little bit biased 
But 
Basically 
You know 
I feel as though religion should never change 
Um 
I mean I realize that they do a little bit every now and then 
Um 
But 
I don’t really feel as though they should change any major point of views 
Um 
To adapt to the twenty first century 
What it comes down to is people nowadays 
Um 
They want 
Uh 
Everything to go the way they want 
Um 
If you would ask somebody a long time ago 
You know 
Uh 
What do you believe in 
What religion 
They’ll say Roman Catholic and that’s it 
Nowadays 
Um 
You’ll get somebody saying oh Christian or Roman Catholic only with my twist on things 
Um 
You know 
If it doesn’t suit somebody’s needs or personal wants then they’re not gonna take it 
And 
They’re just gonna alter it 
And 
I personally think that that’s wrong 
Um 
You know 
It wouldn’t be religion if like 
Like there’s no point in believing something if it’s just what you come up with 
It’s not like the actual religion 
So 
You know 
What’s the point in following something that’s not entirely true 
Or 
Not entirely 
Um 
I can’t think of another word for that 
But 
Um 
Like I’ve talked with numerous people 
Like basically everybody nowadays 
I’m not gonna say everybody 
But 
Um 
A lot of people 
Um 
Have their 
Uh 
Own little unique twist on their religion 
Um 
They say yeah I follow this church or this whatever 
And 
Um 
Only 
You know 
Like 
And then 
Um 
I’m jumping around a little bit 
But 
Their 
Uh 
They 
Um 
Like for instance 
Um 
Like sex before marriage 
Like 
You know 
I don’t like that part so I don’t follow that 

Um 
Or 
Like 
You know 
Following the law 
I know a lot of kids who have said drinking is not 
You know 
Bad at all 
But 
Then I have the other kids that say 
Um 
Well you know 
The bible says to 
Uh 
Obey your law 
So 
In a lot of cases kids 
It all comes down to interpretation I guess 
Um 
But 
On the other hand 
Um 
You know 
When it does come down 
I don’t even know what the heck I’m saying 

Um 
Let me see here 
Like I said it is a lot easier when you’re writing 
Because 
You know 
You’re not on the spot 

So 
I guess that would help the interview with me saying that 
But 
Um 
And 
Um 
Does this 
Is this referring 
Oh yea I remember now 
Um 
Like in reference to the charges against the Catholic Church 

Yeah 

Um 
I believe um 
Some of them yeah would have been prevented 
Um 
But 
I don’t feel as though the Catholic Church should change at all 
Um 
You know 
That 
It’s not the Catholic Church’s fault that 
You know 
Those people do that 
Those are just certain people 
You know 
Like 
Um 
People like that are in any group nowadays 
Like 
You know 
And 
The media loves to pick on the Catholic Church I’ve noticed 
Um 
But 
You know 
I’ve also known of like 
I’ve known 
I’ve heard of Rabbis doing it 
And 
It’s not a big deal to the media if that happens 
Um 
Like I actually saw on the news that a Rabbi 
Um  
Was charged with that 
And 
It was no where near 
Um 
Like as big of a deal as with the Catholic Church 

Um 
You know I was talking with my mom 
And 
Uh 
About that issue 
And 
She says 
You know 
Uh 
It happens every day all over the world 
But 
You know 
A lot of times 
You know 
The media likes to pick on somebody 
And 
Then just stick with it because it makes them seem a little bit worse 
But 
With the Catholic Church a lot of stuff has happened 
Um 
We’re very outspoken 
And 
Um 
I don’t know if that’s the right word to pick 
But 
Um 
You know 
We uh 
We’ve always been 
You know 
Not afraid to 
Uh 
Express our feelings on a certain topic as a church 
Um 
You know 
If Pope John Paul II 
Uh 
He’s done 
He had done a lot while he was the pope 
And 
Now Pope Benedict 
Um 
He 
Ya know 
He uh 
You know 
A lot of people don’t like exactly his conservative ways 
But 
Um 
I don’t know 
I guess 
You know 
I guess like his conservative ways are good 
Um 
And 
Also bad 
Sometimes they’re a little too conservative 
Um 
But 
On the other hand he is sticking true to the religion 
Um 
And 
Therefore 
You know 
Like I feel as though that’s right 
Um 
Sometimes it’s a little too strict 
But 
Um 
Like I said before I don’t feel as though religion should change for anything 
Um 
But 
It does come down to interpretation a lot 
Because 
Um 
For instance Benedict 
Like for Harry Potter or something like that 
That’s a huge thing nowadays in our society 

Um 
He was kind of against that 
And 
I feel as though that was a very strict interpretation of the religion 
A little too strict 

Not that I’m saying that 
You know 
I mean 
And 
If you allow that it’s not like it would be changing the religion 
So 
I guess 
You know 
Um 
You could be 
You could um 
You could accept things nowadays through the religion 
Um 
But 
You know 
You don’t need to be such a strict person about it 
Um 
I’m kinda losing myself so I think that’s about it 

No that’s it
