Um 
Well, I feel like in the grand scheme of things it doesn’t matter if they’re right or wrong 
If they’re 
I mean I guess if you’re talking about just opposed to the 
Um 
Like gay marriage 
Then they can have an opinion 
But, it’s not their place to say whether it’s right or wrong 
It’s not their place to have legal action against gay marriage 
Um 
Like personally like I don’t really think it’s right 
Just um 
I feel like it’s more of like a chemical imbalance in the brain or it’s just something that’s like just like a 
I mean I don’t want to call it a problem, but just my personal 
Like my point of view is that homosexuality is wrong 
But, it’s not 
Like I don’t care 
Like I have friends who have other problems 
And it’s not a problem like and I don’t care if 
Um 
Gay people get married 
Nobody else should except the churches that they get married at 
Um 
I mean this whole thing about George Bush you know trying to amend the Constitution to ban gay marriage 
That’s just 
That’s beyond me 
I don’t understand at all how he thinks he can do that 
Why he thinks that he should have a say in what the church does 
Um 
I mean I have certain friends who are gay and they were in the Catholic Church 
Which I don’t understand because the Catholic Church is completely against that 
And I don’t know why they would be part of something that goes against their morals 
But, there are churches that are Ok with it 
There are churches that say this is fine in the Bible 
Whatever, I don’t really know 
I’m not really religious at all 
But, if that’s what they believe 
I don’t see why anyone else should have a problem with it 
Um 
Um 
Absolutely not 
I don’t think they have any jurisdiction at all 
I mean the separation of church and state is one of like the most important 
Um 
 I mean it’s one of the greatest things that’s ever been like enacted as legislation 
Um 
It was just not something that 
I don’t see how Bush thinks he can get involved 
I mean for his own personal beliefs 
I don’t care 
He can believe whatever he wants 
But, it’s not something that he should you know try to force the churches to do 
It just doesn’t make any sense 
Um 
I mean even leaving it just to the states is wrong in my opinion 
I mean it should be left to like the churches 
And besides 
Like just besides I don’t see how he can just so openly 
I mean he’s trying to amend the constitution which is there to ensure rights 
Not take rights away 
I don’t see why he thinks he can change that 
Um 
And just add a bill that would not allow people to live the way that they want to 
I mean they’re not harming anyone else 
They’re not inhibiting anyone else’s pursuit of happiness 
Anyone else’s you know security 
I mean those are the fundamental parts of the Constitution 
And you know the fundamental rights that 
You know are you know inherent to all humans 
I just 
I don’t understand at all 
I think he’s a moron 
[Ok, do you have any other thoughts on the issue of gay marriage in general?]
Um 
I mean I guess I just can elaborate on like my beliefs 
Just a little bit 
Um 
Like I don’t know 
Like when I do research on it 
When I see like what 
Like they’re like researching just the issue of homosexuality 
And, um 
I don’t know 
Certain things have shown there might be just like too much of a certain 
You know like testosterone or estrogen and too little of the other that’s just causing this imbalance that uh 
I mean accidentally 
I mean it’s kind of like a mistake really 
Just a problem that leads people to believe that they’re attracted to the wrong sex 
Um 
Yeah I mean 
Just certain tests that they’ve done 
Um 
You know and I think also that some people are very gay just um 
I don’t know it might be you know rejection that they’ve had before 
It might have been something that happened when they’ve grown up that like leads them to believe 
To think that they’re gay 
But, I don’t know 
I guess I feel that they’re aren’t people that are born gay 
I don’t really believe in gay people 
I don’t know 
That probably sounds awful 
But, I don’t know 
I just believe everyone is supposed to be straight 
Um 
But, like I don’t care 
If that’s what they want to do that’s fine 
You know 
Um 
You know I’ve got my own problems that other people think are wrong 
But, you know 
So, like I kind of understand 
Um 
Yeah 
I guess I don’t know I just 
While I feel that it is personally wrong 
You know 
They should be free to do whatever they want 
I mean I don’t want to say that’s less competition 
But, you know what I mean 
Um 
No, not really
