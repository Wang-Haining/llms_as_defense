I would say yes 

Um 
I think that 
Um 
A lot of 
Alright actually I’m gonna back up 
Um 
The Catholic Church was and still is a political institution 
I mean it was much more political institution back like when it was first founded 

Um 
And I mean people in politics are corrupt and there were a lot of like the rules or 
Um 
Laws that were made had to do more with the politics of like Europe at the time then actually having to deal with say what God wants us to be doing 

So I think that some of the rules that were made or like things that are part of like the catechism aren’t necessarily 
Um 
Applicable to today’s world and even when they were made it was 
It wasn’t necessarily that 
You know 
If you don’t follow these laws you’re offending God 
It was partly just so the political institution of the church could stay in power 

Um 
So I think that by 
By not changing anything and you know by sticking with these rules that were made a couple hundred years ago or maybe even more 
I think that the Catholic Church is loosing a lot of it’s its members because 
I mean things have changed in the past couple hundred years so I think it’s a lot harder to live by like the rules that are set forth in the catechism so 
I 
I think that it’s a problem that they’re not changing anything because 
Ok 
Yeah there was Vatican 2 and that 
You know now we don’t have mass in Latin and that changed certain things but I think there needs to be another reevaluation because I 
I consider myself a Catholic and I try to follow 
You know 
As much as I can but some of the things I just think are a little bit 
Um 
A little too strict in terms of what you’re actually facing 
Daily life in the 21st century opposed to when these laws if you wanna call them were written 

Um 
I mean in terms of like premarital sex 
In terms of you know contraceptives 
In terms of 
Um 
Whether or not 
Um 
Like priests should be married 
I think that they’re 
Like they’re loosing followers 

Um 
So 
I 
I think that people especially like 
Um 
I 
I kind of noticed here like were at a Catholic school but most people don’t go to church 

Um 
And it’s just 
Children are Baptized Catholic and maybe raised Catholic but they don’t actually like 
Not that many people in 
That I’ve come across actually believe all that much 

Um 
And I think that it’s almost seen as like an all or nothing like if you can’t abide by all the rules then there just like oh well then the Catholic Church isn’t for me and they’ll just go and figure that 
You know 
They won’t be Catholic 
They don’t believe any of the rules and I think that if some of the like the strict ideas were loosened a little bit to adapt more to what’s actually happening in today’s world that there might be more followers 

Hm 
Um 
I think that 
Um 
I don’t know if that would actually like have changed but I could say that I think is that if 
Like 
The priests that are 
You know 
Were accused of pedophilia 
You know 
The age that that they like when they actually became priests 
Like speaking generally here 

Um 
That was 
I mean things have changed since then and I think even since then it’s become more acceptable for 
Um 
You know 
Someone to come out and say that they’re gay so I think that it was almost seen 
Like that’s kinda why you have the stereotype that a lot of priests are gay because it was 
If they weren’t going to get married it would seem strange for them to just be like a single male and so if they 
They just 
Some of them 
Obviously this isn’t everyone but some of them just went into the priesthood and wanted to act of their like their sexual feelings and they 
You know took it out with these children but 
Um 
I think that if 
I don’t know if it would have changed any of that but maybe there wouldn’t have been as 
Um 
If there were allowed to be 
If priests were allowed to be married then 
Um 
I think it 
You wouldn’t have the typical like stereotype of a lot of priests being gay because it wouldn’t be like an alternative like get married or be a priest 

So 

Um 
Maybe about 
You mentioned something about um female priests 

Um 
I’m not sure how I feel about that I guess I think that 
I mean 
Jesus was a male and um I see that 
And you do have nuns so its not like women have no role 

Um 
I would say it doesn’t really bother me that women can’t be priests 
I 
I mean I wouldn’t want to be a priest 
Um 
I don’t know it doesn’t 
It seems like the women can still play a role if they want to go into the religious life 
They can still be a nun 
Um 
It’s not like they’re not given any role 
So 

Um 
I think that’s it
