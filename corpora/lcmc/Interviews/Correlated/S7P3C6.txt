Yes I believe it does because I feel like the Catholic Church is so rule oriented 
I feel like as I become 
Um more like a 
Like as I become able to understand really the Catholic religion and stuff I feel like they don’t 
They’re so rule oriented and they’re so stuck on how everyone else lives their life 
Like why can’t they just teach about Jesus, teach about his role 
And teach about like how we can put Him into our lives instead of 
You know 
Telling us what’s good and what we can and cannot do and stuff like that 
Like where 
Like how do they know really 
I mean maybe it’s just cause I know as a priest and as a deacon or whoever 
However you want to call it 
Like they believe that God 
You know 
Sends his word through them and they speak it to the people 
I understand that 
But like 
I just 
I don’t have faith in that 
I don’t believe that because they’re as human as me 
As I am 
And so like I don’t believe 
That’s why I can’t like go to church and go to like you know all this other Catholic stuff because like I feel like 
I can’t believe someone else 
Like I believe that the only person who I can believe is me and God 
Like when me 
Like when I sit down and pray 
Like that’s how I believe in God will speak to me like directly 
Like I feel like I can’t believe what someone else says because they’re as human as I am 
So how do they really know what God’s saying 
So 
I feel like they need to change their ways to adapt 
To I mean like I want them to change their ways 
Like stuff about the whole marriage thing and stuff like that 
Maybe that will stop all the 
Um 
Pedophiles and stuff 
But then if they change that 
Then they’d just be like everyone else 
You know 
And so I feel like stuff like that about the whole marriage thing 
I think they should keep it the way they are but be more careful about it and be more strict about it and like have a closer watch on them because of the past that they do have 
But and I feel like more so they should change their ways to be more accepting 
Like people shouldn’t look at the Catholic Church and think oh God like if I look at a Catholic person they have all these rules and they can’t 
They don’t accept anybody unless they’re the way that like they are 
And I think like they should change their rules and become more accepting and become more tolerant of other people and the way that people lived their lives because 
And my thing is I’m going off like the whole homosexual thing because that’s the most 
That’s like the most prominent thing that everyone keeps talking about 
About the whole Catholic Church thing is just that they are so against it 
I mean cause yeah it does say it 
Like in the Bible 
You know 
No homosexuality 
But what were 
What were they really talking about? 
And so like 
I guess that’s why I can’t believe like half the stuff that they’re saying because like how do you know what the people that wrote the Bible were even saying because the Bible is such like this metaphorical like literature 
Like how do you know that they were saying directly no to homosexuality 
You know 
Like what were they really talking about? 
And so I feel like they 
Um 
 Like I feel like the Catholic Church is just trying to look at life and look at the world as being black and white 
That there is not like gray area 
And I feel like with 
Um 
My understanding of the Bible and with what I’ve come to learn through my theology class that I’m taking now 
It’s like the Bible is just a guideline and there’s so many different ways to look at it that you can’t look at the Bible in a black and white way and it’s like even though 
Like you 
Like you want to read the Bible 
You want to see all these different things that it’s saying 
It says this and it says not to do this 
But that was at that time 
And like you can look at the Bible like at different times in your life 
And it could mean different things 
Like you can look at the same passage at different times in your life and it’ll mean different things every time you read it cause you’ll be at a different point in your life 
So I feel like you can’t 
Like they need to change the rules to accommodate so that 
And to accommodate for the fact that the Bible isn’t just saying one thing 
Hmm 
I like that 
Wait what you said 
I think they could 
Um 
Let’s see 
I feel like 
I like the way 
Like the way that they are like they don’t have their own rule 
Just because it’ll set them apart 
But I don’t really know 
I mean I think like 
I’m kinda back and forth because at one point I did believe that they should change their rules so that they could 
Um 
Like allow for priests to get married and allow female priests into the like their 
I don’t know 
Their other sector I guess you could call it 
But it’s like then I’m still thinking about the fact that they wouldn’t be 
Like who the Catholic religion is 
So I feel like if they had like a stronger 
Um 
I don’t know if it’s really a stronger way of looking at a 
Keeping watch over it 
Then more so 
Then maybe not everyone that wanted to be a priest should have been a priest 
Not because I feel like the Catholic Church is really, really right now looking for priests because a lot of them are getting old 
A lot of them are dying and stuff 
So they’re really looking for priests so they just take whatever that comes 
And not everyone is really supposed to be because I feel like being chaste is more of like a 
Or being celibate is more of a spiritual thing and you have to be really connected with God in order to really be celibate because it’s so hard and because you have like all these urges to be with someone 
You have all those sexual urges and stuff so I feel like not everyone that was probably 
Like the people that were pedophiles 
Maybe they weren’t supposed to be priests 
So 
I feel like if maybe the Catholic Church probably didn’t have such an urgency for priests and they weren’t just picking up anyone that says yeah maybe I want to be a priest and then they turn him into a priest 
If they weren’t just picking up anyone 
Then maybe like they would have people that really and truly want to be a priest and would really have a connection with God so that even when the sexual urges come they’ll be Ok 
They’ll be like sexual urges are coming, I’ll go pray and then it’s gone 
So maybe like they just 
Maybe they should just screen who are priests so they can you know not commit those things 
No
