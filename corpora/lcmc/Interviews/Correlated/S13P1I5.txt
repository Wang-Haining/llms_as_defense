Um 
I 
I don’t really know 
I’m gonna 
I guess I’ll just try and like talk around 
I’m gonna waiver back and forth but I’ll just try and talk 
Um 
I think that in terms of whether or not we should be 
We should still be there that’s one issue whether or not we should have gone there in the first place is another 
Um 
It’s kinda of just a whole big mess 
I think that the war in Afghanistan that 
I think that that was more acceptable because we were 
At that point we were trying to find 
Um 
Like the people who were responsible for September 11th and that was more like just a retaliation but then 
Um 
I don’t really know whether or not I think Bush wanted to go into Iraq 
You know just for oil 
Or if he 
Um 
The whole thing with weapons of mass destruction 

I’m not really like all that informed on what’s going on but 
Especially like currently 
But I think that it was 
I don’t know if if Bush just wanted like to go over there for oil 
I don’t know if I really 
I really think that 
Um 
I mean with Saddam Hussein and the weapons of mass destruction in 
Um 
In Iraq 
Once like the 
It 
I mean it was very suspicious why he wouldn’t let any UN officials go in and search and then I see why 
Since we had already been attacked 
I mean it seems logical that we would be concerned if if Iraq and Saddam Hussein were producing more weapons of mass destruction and like we would be in danger 
So in that regard it was I guess justified but 
Um 
Now we’ve taken 
They 
There’s like 
We took out there government 
It’s gone 
We’re trying to get them back on their feet but there’s so many different factions and its just a whole big mess 
 
Um 
I think that we started something and we we took out whatever form of government they had and now we can’t just like leave them in complete anarchy 
I mean so since we were responsible for that we need to like stay 
Like we need to follow through and finish it finish it out and make sure that they’re left with some sort of a political structure 
But 
Um 
Like 
What sort of a 
I don’t know if you can answer this but what sort of like a 
Its like war is still going on 
Like are 
Who are we still fighting 

Ok 
Um 
So I guess like the American lives that are still being lost would just be because there’s like so many different political factions that are like all competing against each other 
Is that what’s happening 

Ok 
Yeah 
Um 
I mean its 
Like I think it’s a real shame that American lives are still being lost but I I don’t know 
I don’t really know how to fix it because it’s its not 
I don’t think it would be right of us to just leave them in such a complete mess when we’re the people who got them there but on the other hand all the like the soldiers and the Americans that are loosing their lives 
That’s not really fair either 

Um 
And I’m also like 
I don’t know if this is related or not 
How there’s like people like 
You know people that protest or whatever for peace and want us to leave 
I don’t want that to be mistaken for like not supporting the soldiers because they’re just like 
They’re just supporting our country and they’re 
Like if everybody who says that they’re against the war in Iraq 
I don’t 
I feel bad for the soldiers when they hear all those protests and everything cause they’re risking their lives for our country 
And then to have their their own people not supporting them makes me feel bad 

No
