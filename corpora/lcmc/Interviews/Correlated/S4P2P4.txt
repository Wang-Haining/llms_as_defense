Uh 
I’d have to say no because whatever you post on the internet is fair game for people to look at 
That’s what the internet is 
It’s what it’s for 
And 
If its 
If someone’s protecting other students then I don’t think its invasion of privacy 

Yeah 
Um 
I mean It’d be worse if you didn’t act on 
You know 
That Myspace thing and a shooting occurred 
That’s as worse as it gets 
Because people die if 
If you don’t take that action 

Um 
Well like I said if you post something on the internet 
I mean anyone can read it and it’s not an invasion of privacy if it’s a public posting 
I guess 

Um 
I’d say if it’s a public sight like Myspace 
Well I guess Myspace isn’t 
You have to be a member 
But 
If you are a member 
And I guess some school officials maybe be 
Then 
Then yeah that’s fine to look at information 
Draw conclusions on 
Based on that information 
But um 
I would say its not ok if 
If its like a secure website and you hack in somehow 
Then that would be the only case where I’d say no you can’t do that 

Yeah 
Um 
Could you repeat the question 

Ok 
Um 
Maybe if they have like a person designated to look up these 
This data 
Then that would be kinda weird 
And I guess that would be over the line 
But if like 
They just happen to come across it then 
Then that’s not crossing the line 

Nope
