Absolutely it is 
Um 
And both ways 
Um 
Depends on the profession 
Woah chair 
Um 
It depends on the profession 
There are certain professions where 
You know are seen as the female profession and if a man is in that profession 
Say teaching or nursing 
I think teaching is changing a bit more 
But, it’s seen as almost like it’s a little bit off 
Um 
And people will say it 
It’s something that comes up 
Uh 
I know it was a joke in the Meet the Parents movies that he was a nurse and not a doctor and it’s almost like, oh you couldn’t be a doctor so you had to become a nurse 
His choice was to become a nurse and that gender 
Because if a woman decides to become a nurse it’s because she wants to spend more time at home with her family or she just would rather be a nurse than a doctor 
Um 
And then you have the glass ceiling 
Um 
And the, the joke that if a woman is at the top in a company she had to sleep her way there 
Um 
And seriously if women are sleeping their way to the top why aren’t there women at the top?
Um 
So it’s definitely still there 
I don’t know what can be done about it because it’s one of those things that it’s a prejudice that’s kind of ingrained in people at this point 
And 
Um 
We can make the conscious effort at this point to change it 
But, I don’t think there’s anything the government can do other than saying you have to have equal wages 
Which doesn’t happen because it’s at the discretion of the employer 
Um 
Like if a man and a woman are doing the same job sometimes the man will be paid more or less 
Sometimes the woman will be paid more or less 
Um 
It’s definitely rampant 
But, it’s on both sides 
It’s not just towards women or just towards men 
Um 
Which I think is something a lot of people don’t think about 
Is gender discrimination towards men 
Oh I definitely do 
I mean think about all the women that say men can’t live with them, can’t kill them 
There’s many more like 
Like women complain about being objectified, but I think men get it too 
It’s just it seems more acceptable almost to like oh well he’s being stupid, well it’s because he’s a man 
Or he’s being a lunk head because he’s a man 
That’s the only thing that could be wrong?
Or the same thing towards a woman 
Oh well she must be PMSing 
Cause that’s the only thing that could be wrong 
She couldn’t be 
She could be just a raging bitch 
Excuse my language 
She could just be a very angry woman 
A very bitter, angry woman 
Or, yes she could be PMSing 
For a man, he could just be having a horrible week and just taken off and not wanted to deal with anything 
But, a lot of times like I just said it’s oh he’s being a man 
He’s going to the gym or he’s watching football 
He doesn’t care because 
Oh it’s Ok that he’s not paying to attention to me because he’s watching football because he’s a man 
I think maybe people don’t think of that as gender discrimination, but it definitely is 
I mean 
I mean I don’t know what we can do about it except to try and make a conscious decision in everybody’s personal lives to not do it 
Make the conscious decision to not be prejudiced against someone else 
Whether it’s for gender or whether it’s for anything else 
But, it’s here 
It’s something that I don’t think is going to change anytime soon 
Um 
Yeah 
I don’t know really what else to say about it 
Um 
Nope
