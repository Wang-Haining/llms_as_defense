Um 
I do believe gender discrimination is still an issue in the present day United States 
Not so much in the forms that it used to be 
Uh 
I think it it’s only an issue today 
Because 
It was an issue several years ago 
Um 
By that I mean we’re not actively trying to discriminate as much 
Um 
By gender today as most certainly the occurrence in the business world maybe fifty years ago 
But 
As a result of that discrimination back then it still has leaked into today 
And 
It’s proven hard for 
Um 
Females statistically to move around within companies 
So I think it is a problem today 
But 
It’s not so much an active problem 
It’s much more sort of a lingering problem from our past actions 

Um 
I think to change it the only thing you can really stress is just an awareness 
Um 
Knowing that thoughts or actions may have some sort of hidden meaning 
Um 
Or hidden 
Um 
Some underlying process in your mind that is causing you to do those things when they’re not completely justified 
Um 
The way to break any sort of discrimination or diversity issues is just to be open minded about other forms of communication 
Other forms of expression that way we’re not viewing them 
And 
Immediately shutting down just because they’re different 
But 
I think if we’re just open to other forms of communication 
Um 
Linguistic styles etcetera then we’ll be able to break down the discrimination that is occurring 

Um 
I think you know pretty much every type of person whether it’s by gender age or whatever it is discriminated upon 
But 
Certainly statistics would show that 
Um 
Whether it be females 
Or 
African Americans are statistically much more so discriminated against 
And 
The effects are shown in society and business and what not 
But 
I mean everybody is discriminated against in the sense that some people have created stereotypes for either a male or a female or someone who’s Caucasian or Black 
And 
There isn’t necessarily a justified means to the stereotype 

Um 
I just think that 
Um 
Whether I mean anybody has the ability to discriminate 
And 
It’s not necessarily shown in much in society through statistics or through you know the CEOs of companies that males are discriminated against 
But 
It certainly exists because there are people out there who have preconceived notions about the way a male will behave or the way a male will communicate 
And 
Those communication channels have been more accepted in the business world over the past fifty a hundred years which is why that discrimination has built up against females 
But 
If we can start to break down those 
And 
Understand the difference in styles of expression we can also understand that discrimination is unjust 
And 
That females are just as equal to males in business as well as any other arena 

No that’s it
