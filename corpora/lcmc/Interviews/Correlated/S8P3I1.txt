Uh
Personally I think that it’s an unjust war
I thought it was in the beginning
I didn’t really see any reason for why we should be in Iraq
I thought
Like originally I felt like the war was supposed be in Afghanistan where we were fighting al-Qaeda
And the terrorism over there
But 
Then we moved to Iraq
And I honestly didn’t see why it all of a sudden came into the picture
And I didn’t feel that they have enough evidence in order to go in there
Anyway in the first place
And 
I felt
I feel now that it’s continued on really
Really long 
Longer than it was suppose to
Mission accomplished was
Uh
Mentioned a couple years back
And I still haven’t seen any kind of change  
Or in the system
I feel that we don’t
We haven’t
Uh 
Put in 
Uh
A government that really is going to be stable
And remain stable for several years for several years after
We pull our troops out of Iraq
So basically I feel that we’re kind of stuck there
And we have to kind of bare with it until then
And hopefully something good will turn out
But 
I honestly don’t agree with what happened

Yeah uh
George W. Bush announced the mission accomplished a couple of years back saying that the war in Iraq was over
And that we could start bringing the troops back home everything had been
At that point in time I felt that everything had gone right
And maybe he did make the right decision
But apparently not
Because we are still in there right now 
We’re still having difficulties
Our troops are still being sent over
And we haven’t really seen much change at all
And the government is
The government and it’s society over in Iraq has been torn to bits from what we have done
From what I feel 

Uh
I think
As of right now it needs to continue
More not because
Uh
Not because we need to 
Uh 
Fight it out 
And try to win 
But just because we need to try to set up something that 
Could actually remain there
And people could actually survive 
And because what it is right now 
I think if were to just pull out right now we would just start a civil war 
And everything would be torn to bits even more than it already has been 

Well because right now we have both the Sunnis and the Shites who are both obviously in serious opposition in Iraq
So
Pulling out right now would just 
They didn’t have a stable government 
And we’re trying to empower the Shites 
But the Sunnis even though they are the minority 
They still do not agree with the government that we’re trying to put in place
So chances are terrorism would increase in Iraq 
Uh
There would be a lot more casualties in terms of civilians then there already have been 
And it’s really not worth it to try an pull out 
And leave them defenseless as of now

Uh
Not to much 
It
Pretty much what I mentioned before 
And 
I guess I just overall feel that it’s an unjust war 
It never was meant to happen
And it was just kind of bad decision making
And a lack of intelligence that led us into it 

Uh no 
I think that’s about 
About all
