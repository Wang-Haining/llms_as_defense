Um 
Gender discrimination 
Well I mean there’s a wage gap 
I know that much 
Um 
But I wouldn’t really say that gender discrimination is a huge problem 
I know that there’s a wage gap but I think that in terms of 
I mean when 
When you think of discrimination you think of disparity of opportunities 
And I think that in terms of disparity of opportunities there is a disparity between men and women 
But it’s nowhere near as drastic as the disparities that are along racial lines or geographic lines or 
I mean kids you know 
I mean for instance 
Like access to education I think is a much bigger particular problem than 
Education discrimination because every child in a particular neighborhood growing up is going to afford a public education whether they’re a boy or a girl 
And then in theory they would have similar opportunities to succeed 
Um 
But you know 
What does that public school look like? 
How much money does it have to spend? 
Do they have transportation to get there? 
I mean the answer 
Is the fundamental 
Does that school have enough materials, enough teachers 
I mean I think that that is a much more pressing form of discrimination than gender discrimination is so 
Although it may exist 
Um 
I think if we’re going to put our efforts into battling discrimination I think it’s kinda institutionalized these problems 
Um 
In terms of geographical separation which leads to racial discrimination 
Um 
Would be something to tackle first 
In the workplace or otherwise?
Um 
Not 
I mean I’m sure that there might be specific examples 
Um 
But I mean living in a society that has kind of progressed out of this sort of nuclear family male breadwinner mother thing through kind of  feminism and the Betty [inaudible] age to kind of a 
A 
A 
Place of parody where we are now 
I think that there are remnants of 
Uh 
Of some discrimination towards women left over 
But I think not particularly towards men on anything 
I mean 
I mean I’m sure it exists somewhere 
But I wouldn’t say it’s like a stemming problem 
Uh 
With regard to gender or 
Um 
I mean there are plenty 
Plenty of success stories of women who are 
Who are driven and smart and just as capable as men 
And I 
I don’t really think there’s too much of a disparity in capability relatively between women and men 
Um 
So I mean it 
I mean it’s really tough cause I guess the only real tangible sort of discrimination that I can think of off the top of my head in terms of gender would be the wage gap 
Um 
But a lot of those 
I mean who knows how particular companies determine how they pay people 
And I mean it’s not like you can just make some kind of legislation where the government would just step in and say oh well your pay scale has to follow all these certain algorithms 
I mean I don’t feel like I could ever really picture that flying 
Um 
So 
I mean all in all I can’t really think of anything off the top of my head 
I’m probably gonna think of something in like four or five hours and then say, hey I wish I had said that 
Um 
Um 
No
