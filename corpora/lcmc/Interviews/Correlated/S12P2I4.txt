Um 
I feel like the war has been drawn out far too much 
I think the purpose was good in the beginning 
Um 
Meaning to restore democracy in another country 
But 
I think we’ve long since lost sight of that purpose 
And 
We’re now just maybe doing it for the sake of doing it 
Just to prove that we’re some sort of super power in the world 
I just think also maybe the motives were originally questionable dealing with 
Um 
George Bush’s father’s previous quarrels with Saddam Hussein 
So 
I think 
Um 
I think the original motivation if it was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system then that would be a fair motivation if there were any personal matters in it I do not think it would have been fair 
But 
I do think it’s been drawn out 
Um 
I think we got our purpose across in the first couple months just starting the war I think that was a statement in and of itself 
But 
The fact that it has gone on for over a year several years 
I just think it’s way too drawn out 

Um 
Yeah I think 
Um 
I mean if our purpose was to give democracy to a country that was ruled by a tyrant I think that’s a just purpose 
And 
That’s good reason for the war 
But 
I don’t think 
I think our reason over time has been deteriorated 
And 
Misconceived 
Just like seems that we’re still at war for the purpose of going to war 
And 
We don’t want to come out of this thing without a decisive end a victory or what not 

Um 
Yeah I do think it has gone on long enough 
And 
It should stop 
I mean there comes a point when their government 
Their officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway 
And 
I think that time has come 
We’ve long since been draining our own economy spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf such as poverty and what not that we should be spending that money on I think it’s a drain on our economy for a purpose that’s long since been drawn out 

Yeah I mean they’re spending billions and billions of dollars 
And 
War is not something that should be in our budget for the long term 
There are things obviously such as poverty or internal improvements 
You know 
Um 
Public roads or anything dealing with schools 
We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that 
Health care that I think that money could be much better spent on 
Right now that money’s being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we’ve lost the cause for 

I think that’s it
