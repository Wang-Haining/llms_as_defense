Um yes I feel that the Catholic Church does need to adapt to the 21st century in some aspects, but not in all 
I do believe that they should have women as priests because right now there is actually a shortage of people going into the priesthood 
And the reason is because they’re not allowed to get married and that’s another thing that I think should change 
I think priests should be able to be allowed to be married because that would encourage more people to seek the priesthood and that type of lifestyle 
And the only reason why that rule was ever made to begin with was because back way, way in the day when popes were just starting to like gain I guess the power 
And the whole splitting of the church into the orthodox and everything there was corruption because they were pocketing money and like paying more attention to their families than they were to the actual religious part of life 
But, back then for popes 
Religion wasn’t even a big part of their popedom 
It was all political 
And so that’s why the rules were made into effect 
But, obviously there is a strict line between politics and religion right now in place and I think that people are very aware of where we come from and like 
Cause I’m a Catholic 
Um 
That they’re going to be more cautious of movements that they do and that I feel if people were able to be married in the priesthood that actually it would probably be more widely accepted as a religion because I know Episcopalians and a lot of other sects of Christianity do allow that 
And so people are actually drawn to that because they see it as like an equality type of status versus somebody who’s above someone else 
And um 
I guess also that for Catholicism 
Um 
The way that they 
I don’t know what I was gonna say 
I lost my train of thought 
Yeah 
I do feel that that couldn’t happen because 
Um 
Biologically a lot of people feel the need to like satisfy certain criterion that are just normal to human beings cause we’re all animals per say 
And I feel that if they could marry then 
And have families they’d have a more stable life 
And a lot of the covering up by the church I feel is because they didn’t want to acknowledge the fact that molestation was going on within the religion 
And I feel like it was handled very poorly because they probably didn’t themselves even realize how to handle it and they thought that by moving these particular people who were offenders to particular locations would solve the problems 
But really that’s just moving a problem from one place to another 
And I feel that if they dealt with the situation in a more openhanded way and like knew what they were doing and actually acknowledged the fact and tried to right the situation from the very beginning then all of this I guess negative feeling toward the Catholic Church 
Um 
Wouldn’t be in place because they would realize like oh well then these are just particular people that are acting a certain way, but they’re being dealt with in a way they shouldn’t be dealt with 
And so in a way that was like a fault of the Pope or the officials that were handling the situation in like a hush hush type of manner 
So I feel like it could have been handled in a very 
In a much better way than it was 
Um 
I like it how we have a Pope because it’s kind of a unifying aspect because there’s so many different churches all around the world that are Catholic and it’s not like he’s a King or anything 
It’s just basically he’s there to keep in place the main rules that God has establish through 
Um 
The Bible 
And he’s there to like help solve disputes and set a good example for the rest of the Catholic community 
And while I don’t believe everything that the Pope says 
Um 
Is true 
I feel that he’s still a good example to have 
And um 
He’s supposed to be like really close to God which is good 
And there’s a lot of types of Christianity such as Baptism or like other types like Lutheran and stuff 
Or even just like churches on their own that aren’t part of a huge segregation 
Or not segregation 
Section of Christianity 
That it’s all up that individual church to determine what reading they do on what Sunday and like how they’re gonna go about explaining it 
And I feel like it’s best to have a Pope to 
Um 
Delegate 
Like Ok these readings are gonna be on this Sunday 
All across the world 
And so you can take those readings and have the freedom to explain it to your listeners to how you feel is right 
But, at least there’s someone there to be like this is how we’re gonna do it and like I trust you 
It’s not like a King where he’s going to be like I don’t trust you 
I don’t know 
Um 
Not at the present moment 
Ok
