No that’s not an invasion of privacy oh my gosh 
I didn’t even I didn’t even believe that one 
Um 
How can you post a bulletin on Myspace 
OK I’ve had a Myspace 
All of your friends see your bulletins 

How can you post that and then say oh school officials found it so then that’s an invasion of privacy 
Because 
I didn’t want them to see it 

OK 
But 
You want everyone else in the world to see it 
And 
People on Myspace are not just friends with people they know 
They’re friends with like random people they will never meet in life 
And 
All sorts of weird people who just friend them 
And 
They don’t think anything of friend-ing them 
Those people can see anything you post on a bulletin 
All of those people know that you want to shoot up the school tomorrow 
You don’t 
I think that’s just gotta be like a desperate plea for attention or something 

That’s that’s incredibly like the worst defense I’ve ever heard is someone looking at a bulletin you consciously posted knowing a lot of people would see it as an invasion of privacy 
Because 
The wrong people saw it 
Because 
The wrong quote unquote people saw it who happened to probably save a bunch of people from getting injured or killed 
Um 
Just because it went unfortunately for you doesn’t mean that you were treated unjustly 
That is just I can’t really think of a way to make a case for that being seen as an invasion of privacy 
Going through a girls purse 
Going into a home without a search warrant 
Um 
I can even see more of a case of going through a kids locker at school as an invasion of privacy 
Because 
At least then like you know it’s locked 
You have a specific set of people who has access to that 
And 
You’re in full control 
But 
A Myspace bulletin 
Um 
Yeah 
I wish I knew how that happened 
Like if it was one of the kids who saw the bulletin that turned it in 
Or 
Just school officials surfing Myspace 
Because 
Either way it makes total sense 

That’s that really is like just 
That’s like sending out a note to your entire school 
I mean you don’t think like the principal’s gonna find one on the floor if you pass out fliers 

I just I can’t make a case for that 
And 
If that goes through then I don’t know what’s wrong 
Because 
I’m sure people have been convicted on lesser things of greater charges 
Like stuff they post in blogs 
The internet is fair game for police surveillance as well it should be 
Because 
So much crap goes on there 
Like 
Um 
Soliciting child porn 
Stuff like that 

There’s so much good stuff 
Or 
Good things that are done to prevent nasty things from going down on the internet 
I mean it is something that has to be watched because it’s a major way of communicating with a whole bunch of people 
And 
That’s just crazy 

School officials should draw the line at personal property of the student 
Um 
Without reasonable cause 
Because 
Going through a locker is acceptable 
Because 
It is school property 
And 
You know you’re only supposed to keep like your school stuff in there 
What you need for school 
And 
Frankly if you have like illegal substances in your locker then it’s your own fault if you get caught 
Because 
That’s just tempting fate 
I mean why would you even bring that stuff in if you don’t expect to be like seen with it 

There’s not a point 
But 
Just like 
They should draw the line at like hard evidence 
‘Cause 
To do stuff like go through a backpack though 
Or 
A girl’s purse where they use it outside of school 
And 
You know 
It doesn’t it’s not all about school so it’s not provided by the school 
It’s not specifically for school use 
So 
The school really needs to have a concrete reason for going in 
And 
Invading stuff like that 
I mean if you see a kid like put pot into their purse or whatever then yeah ok please empty your purse 
And 
Let me see what you have 
It’s like please empty your pockets to a kid in second grade 
But 
Yeah 
Um 
Lockers desks fair game 
Um 
School officials have pretty broad rights that way I think 
Because 
Um 
Well they have big responsibilities to keep a whole bunch of kids safe at times in their life where kids are rebelling 
And 
Really just going out of their way to do stuff that they shouldn’t 
So 
I think they should be given some leniency 
But 
I think in the end they need to be able to defend their actions to a reasonable group of people 

Um 
No
