Alright 
Um 
Well yeah I mean I definitely 
I mean you can’t really like say that it’s not an issue like it’s just like a question of like what can actually be done about it 
Um 
Like I know like laws enacted 
Um you know 
Against like racism 
Against races 
You know other cultures exist 
Um 
But, like I don’t really know like what our country can do about like a problem with sexism 
Um 
And since it’s like the racism laws clearly aren’t working like 
I feel like we need a totally different way of 
You know 
Approaching both problems really 
Um 
Do I just keep talking? 
Do you want to ask a question? 
Well I mean I think 
I mean I think it will always be true 
I mean I don’t think you can really avoid you know social stereotypes no matter what laws you enact 
I mean it’s always going to be present in people’s minds 
There’s always going to be sexists, there’s always going to be racists 
Um 
I mean I’m sure like 
Just like the differences that are inherent in men and women 
Uh 
Like I mean cause there to be difficulties 
And like differences and what kind of jobs 
Um are offered 
Just cause people can’t look past 
Um 
You know some of these things 
I mean if you’re getting a job that requires 
Uh 
Like more like grunt work I guess 
I mean men are always going to be given priority for those jobs 
Um 
Whereas like certain jobs where like 
I don’t know I guess like a pretty face is needed 
Um 
Like I don’t really know what 
But, I mean there are certainly some jobs that women are gonna get that men probably aren’t going to get 
Um 
It’s kind of the reversal of that too 
Um 
Well sure 
I mean men have the same 
You know not the same stereotypes obviously, but the same kind of social stereotyping that you know is used against women 
Um 
Just cause like 
Um 
Most people have in their minds like an ideal portrait of what a women is supposed to be and what a man is supposed to be 
Um 
And I think that’s always going to be there 
Um 
I don’t 
You know I don’t really know 
But, um 
I’m sure like just like one thing is definitely there was all this like 
All these laws that are like being enacted to protect women in the workplace 
Um 
Even that is just kind of like stereotyping against men cause they’re painting men as you know people who are sexist against women so 
I don’t really know if that makes any sense at all 
But 
Um 
Well I feel like just the discrimination is never going 
I mean that will never change 
I mean you’d have to change people themselves to uh really change how they feel about women 
Um 
I mean I guess the best thing to do is like learning what image we want to you know 
Uh 
Our children to grow up seeing of what a woman is and what a man is and just like you know educate them from the beginning 
Cause you know in the future they’re going to be the ones who are 
Uh 
Going to be the ones who are the future sexists or non-sexists 
I mean really I thin education is the most important way to solve really any problems 
Well not you know 
Not every problem 
But, um 
For the future if we change the way our children feel then I mean 
Then we’ll have a lot less problems 
Um 
I mean just at like the very basic level 
I mean you look at just the word discrimination and what it means is just like to be able to tell the difference between two things 
To be able to recognize how they’re different 
Um 
Certainly like on that level 
I mean discrimination isn’t really a bad thing 
But, it’s just like I don’t know 
I just have a problem with using the word discrimination because we should understand our differences 
We just you know let them you know get in the way 
Um 
Well I guess it’s just like I mean there are differences between men and women 
That’s I mean obvious 
Um 
And we should know the differences between men and women 
I mean we don’t want a future where um you know men and women are the same 
I mean that just wouldn’t make any sense 
So we should understand that there are things that men can do that women can’t do 
There’s certain things that women can do that men can’t 
Um 
I mean that just makes the whole situation of like gender discrimination a lot harder to understand 
A lot harder to come to a solution 
Uh 
About 
So I mean I think we should be able to understand 
Like understand our differences, but not particularly let them impede like the jobs that women can get and women can’t get 
Um 
Not particularly
