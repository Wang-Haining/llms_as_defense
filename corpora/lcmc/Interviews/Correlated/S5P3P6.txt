Um 
No I don’t think it was an invasion of privacy because the internet is open for the public to see 
So I don’t know what the child was thinking in posting something like that if he didn’t want to get caught 
Um 
Maybe it was a cry for help 
Or something 
I mean I know the principals at my old high school 
They had 
They were on Myspace 
They were on Facebook 
They were friends with students but its just 
If you accept that friendship or if your putting something up there you just have to be ready for that to happen 
You never know whose going to be able to see your postings 

Um 
Ok 
Um 
Alright so 
I don’t think it was an invasion of privacy 
Um 
I think because it was for the good of the community 
The good of all the kids that go to school there 
That they acted in the right way 
Um 
I’m trying to think of a situation that would be bad 
I mean in my opinion 
For me personally probably because I’m 18 
I would hate it if there was something like pictures from parties posted 
And then students were called in 
And they were 
Um 
Given not infractions 
Given detentions or something like that 
I think that that would be an invasion of privacy 
If they tried to get people in trouble for stuff they do on the weekends 
But in the case where a child was going to bring a gun into school I don’t think it was an invasion of privacy 
Anything that comes into the school 
I think is ok 
To invade the privacy of whatever they did 

Um 
Anything in school 
That could come to school like a shooting 
Um 
If they saw something 
Um 
I guess something that was 
Um 
That could hurt a person 
Emotionally or physically 
Um 
It could be a blurry line sometimes cause you could say in one case don’t do this and do that but 
Um 
I guess they just 
I don’t know the exact line 
I guess you’ll just have to 
They will just have to 
Play it by ear and 
Um 
Take each situation as it comes 
And then deal with the issue once it arises 

Um 
No
