Uh 
I would say so
Um 
I’m a catholic and 
Uh 
I kinda feel like the Catholic Church just dictates what the truth is 
Like without even having fact based science I guess 
Um 
And 
The whole thing with the priests not being able to marry 

Um 
I mean it doesn’t really make sense to me 
If you allow priests to marry you would get way more priests to join 
And you know I just don’t see the reason behind that 

Sure 
Um 
Like one of the things 
Uh 
I have against the church is that 
They 
The whole Eucharist thing 
They actually believe that the bread and wine is the body and blood of Christ 
 
And that its not a symbol 
And where clearly it is bread and wine and it can be a symbol but 
They say it isn’t a symbol 
I just have a problem with that 

Sure 
Um 
I mean it would make economic sense to 
Increase the number of priests within the church 
It would make it stronger I guess 
And uh 
Its 
People can 
You know 
Be devoted to their jobs fine when their able to marry 
(pause) 

Yeah absolutely 
Um 
It’s human nature to 
You know have sexual desires 
And 
When its illegal I guess for priests to 
To uh 
Fulfill those desires 
You know you get the pedophilia scandal 
So if you incorporated people who 
Were I 
I guess 
Um 
Uh 
Normal then it wouldn’t really be that much of a problem 

Sure 
Um 
Like if you compare the priesthood to any other job there’s not such a strong correlation between pedophilia and 
You know 
A specific job because those people can satisfy their sexual desires 
Where as priests can’t 

Nope
