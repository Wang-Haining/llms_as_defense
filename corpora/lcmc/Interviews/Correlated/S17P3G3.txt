I do think one side is right 
I think the side 
Um 
For gay marriage is right 
Because 
I think people have 
Should have the option of being able to be married to whoever they want to 
Um 
If they found a companion 
Life partner 
In someone who was of the same gender as them 
Then 
Why shouldn’t they be able to spend the rest of their life with them 
And 
Be legally married 
Just as a heterosexual couple would be 
Um 
I don’t think there’s anything particularly different about a relationship like that 
That should disqualify it from marriage 
Even though 
Uh 
Traditionally 
Marriage is between a man and a woman 
It doesn’t mean marriage can’t be between two men or between two women 

Uh 
I guess 
There’s just not that much of a difference 
I think everyone should be able to 
Live with who they want to live with 
And 
Be married to whoever they want to be married with 
And 
I don’t think that the government has a role 
Or responsibility 
To 
To have any say in who can marry who 
Um 
The government can’t be 
Like 
You can’t marry 
A woman can’t marry a specific man 
They just let a woman marry whichever man she chooses 
Um 
So they don’t have a say there 
But why should they have a say 
Over 
What gender you can marry 
There’s no other restrictions on who you can marry 
But only what gender you can marry 
And that doesn’t seem right 

Um 
I don’t think the federal government should be involved in this issue 
Any government should be involved in this issue 
For that matter 
So 
Therefore 
I don’t support that ban 
Um 
As I said before 
I think that  
Um 
Gay couples have just as much a right as any other couple to be married 
So 
A ban like that would be something I would oppose 

Do you have anything in particular 

Um 
I 
I just 
Think that the ban would 
Um 
Prohibit people from being with the people they want to be with for the rest of their life 
And 
Uh 
It’s not really fair to say that 
Just based on sexual preference 

Nope
