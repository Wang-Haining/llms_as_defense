I think gender discrimination is still an issue 
But 
It will never be an issue 
It will never not be an issue until little girls stop playing with Barbies 
And 
Little boy stop playing with Tonka trucks 

Because 
Differences start so early on 
And 
Like 
Even in the way we treat our children like as babies 
People say different things to baby boys and baby girls that give them expectations of themselves 
And 
It just pervades society those expectations that boys need to be strong 
And 
Girls are sweet and caring 
And 
That carries over into the work place 
And 
Well I guess it’s just stereotyping basically 
It’s kind of a psychological thing I think where unless people think of boys and girls the exact same way since like the day they’re born then I can’t see it ever stopping 
I know there’s a big movement for people to respect the different roles of boys and girls 
And 
Like value them equally 
Um 
But 
Does that mean it’s still discrimination 
‘Cause 
Men and women are always going to be different 
There’s just inherent differences 
Not just physical but mental too 
In the way they think 
And 
Brain activity 
And 
You know 
Should men and women be treated exactly the same 
I know in the workplace is a different story 
Like with pay and things like that that 
Um 
There’s no reason that men shouldn’t be paid the same amount as a woman 
But 
Does it happen all the time 
Probably not 
I mean there’s not just like pay and hiring discrimination 
There’s certain things like 
Um 
Sexual harassment in the workplace 
How often does that happen to men 
It’s like 
And 
If it did what would we do about it 
We’d laugh 
Say wow you don’t like that 

So 
There is discrimination in many many forms 

To change the discrimination 
Um 
Well 
I’m really just not sure what to do about things like hiring and pay discrimination 
Because 
We had affirmative action for that 
And 
I’m not sure how well that turned out 
Because 
It created a lot of bitterness I know in some people that I know even like applying for college 
Um 
That a women would be accepted before 
A middle class white woman would be accepted before a middle class white male of the same qualities background strengths whatever 

Um 
It creates a lot of bitterness 
And 
Just I think there’s ways to get around it 
I think there’s ways it’s being abused too 
So 
To correct discrimination like that 
Whoo 
Um 
Well first people need to stop 
To start bringing up their children differently 

Because 
It’s not just that 
It starts there 
It starts when you’re a child 
And 
The way you think of girls 
And 
Stuff like that 
And 
I’m sure boys who have been raised in different kinds of homes will be more likely to hire a woman respect her give her a fair wage 
And 
Stuff like that as opposed to others 
Also on your way up 
On your way growing up and on your way up in the corporate chain you run into lots of different things that can change your perception 
And 
To get society to change is hard 
But 
It’s happening 
It just has to happen where all of a sudden it’s just so looked down upon to talk about a woman in a negative manner 
Or 
To laugh about haha I’m getting more than this woman who works the same job as me 
And 
It just has to get to the point 
And 
It is it is 
Because 
Of like media publicity 
And 
So many women speakers who have taken it on themselves to like push the issue that people look on it like racism 
Like when someone makes a racist comment everyone’s like oh my god I don’t believe you just said that 
What’s wrong with you 

It’s starting to become like that 
And 
I think we just need to keep pushing it and pushing it 
And 
The more exposure people have to to 
Um 
Things that say hey women do this really well 
And 
Women deserve this kind of treatment 
And 
Women deserve to be top paying executives in these kinds of companies 
People will start to believe it more 
Because 
It’s I don’t wanna say it 
But 
It’s mostly about like exposure 
And 
Advertising 
And 
How much you can get a certain message out there 
Because 
Public opinion is very influential in those kinds of situations 

Oh I’m sure men are discriminated against like especially when 
Uh 
Men take on feminine jobs like nurses 
And 
Stuff 
But 
Again it’s changing 
Because 
There’s shows now like I don’t know I think Scrubs 
Grey’s Anatomy probably has male nurses 
ER I’m sure does 
Um 
There’s just a whole bunch of shows like that that have these really cool guys in nurses roles and stuff that make it OK 
And 
People are like hey that’s cool I like that actor I like that guy I like his role 
And 
Just the more you see of it 
It’s harder when you’re the one guy who’s there with like a bunch of women 
And 
They’re all sitting at their lunch table 
And 
They’re all giggling and laughing 
And 
That can be discrimination 
And 
I can probably imagine that men in those kind of situations haven’t gotten paid as much as women either 
Because 
They’re not performing in their traditional roles 
But 
Again 
It’s changing 
And 
It’s been less publicized probably because men complain less 
But 
They’re working on it 

Um 
No I just think it’s a 
Um 
It’s a work in progress 
And 
That they way 
If things just keep up the way they’re going 
In another generation things will get better 
And 
It will just progress from there
