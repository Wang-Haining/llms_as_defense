Hm 
Lets see 
At first we would have to examine 
The teachings of the Catholic Church today and there doctrines and things like that so 
Then how that could possibly be in contrast with things that are going on in the 21st century 

Um 
So 
I guess probably one of the things that a lot of people find problem with in the Catholic Church teachings is their strong position against abortion 

And 
There’s a lot of debate about that today 
Women’s 
A women’s right to choose or not to have a child and 
And 
And under what circumstances 
And 
And when is 
When is 
When does life begin 
And so the Catholic Church says that life begins at conception 

And 
A lot of people disagree with that 
Um 
I personally believe 
Well I’m personally against abortion 
Um 
And 
I mean so I think the Catholic Church is right on that because I don’t think that 
Anyone has a right to 
To decide who lives and who dies 

So 
So I 
So I’m against abortion so I agree with the Catholic Church in that and then a lot 
And then 
I mean 
Most people who do get abortions its 
It’s usually 
It’s either a form of 
Of birth control or its 
Um 
Or its 
Its an 
And then sometimes people may say well it’s under 
What about under extreme circumstances 

Like someone whose raped or something like that and that’s a terrible thing but I still don’t believe that we have the right to decide who lives and who dies and 
Um 
Um 
I think that 
Well the national government 
Um 
Took a 
Took a stand against partial birth abortion when they passed the partial birth abortion ban 
And so 
So I think a lot of people 
Um 
Have feelings against 
Against uh 
Abortion or at least at that stage 

And so 
So in the area of abortion I don’t think 
I think that 
I would have to agree with the Catholic Church and then 
Um 
The 
Church’s also against the death penalty 

And I would have to agree with that to 
I think the United States is 
Would actually be the country kind of going against the trend of the 21st century in that most other countries there is no death penalty and that’s pretty much something that you can find anywhere in 
You know 
Say the Middle Ages or something like that but it’s pretty much been phased out of 
Of most of the world’s 
In the 21st century and yet the United States 
Uh still employs the death penalty and the way the Catholic Church looks at it is its 
Once again its 
We 
We don’t have the right to decide who lives and who dies but also its 
The 
They system by which the death penalty is um 
Is um 
Employed its 
It’s a system of discrimination and it just goes against everyone’s human rights 
I mean 
More then half of the people who were put to death 
Um 
Are minorities and 
And poor people who 
Who don’t have the money the means to 
To hire good lawyers 
To afford appeal after appeal after appeal 
Um 
And its 
And it’s not a just system either because after people have been put to death evidences 
New evidence comes to light that these people really didn’t commit these crimes 

And so I just think that the chance that 
That you could be putting to death someone whose completely innocent that 
Just terrifies me and that’s just absolutely wrong I think 
So 
Um 
So I’m 
So I would agree with the Catholic Church in their 
In their position against the death penalty and I think in that case the country of the United States is going against trends in the 21st century 
Um 
Now lets see 
The Catholic Church also 
They do not allow women to become priests 

And 
That I don’t think I agree with because 
Um 
In in the world and now we’re in the 21st century and women have been taking on greater roles in society and are working towards becoming 
Um 
Achieving equality and 
And so they should have the same rights as men and be able to do the same things as men 
And 
One would think that the Catholic Church because it’s in 
In such a great need of 
Of priests 
Yeah I think if they 
I think if they opened it up to 
To women 
They would get a lot more of them 
I mean that’s what I hear almost at every masses 
Um 
Intentions for 
Um 
The recognition of vocations to the priesthood or religious life and things like that 

Um 
And 
You know I think eh 
And its there are plenty of examples in other religious denominations of 
Of women having important roles 
Leadership roles in just just another Christian denominations there are female um 
Reverends and 
And things like that 
And 
So I’m not exactly sure why the Catholic Church is so staunch in its position to exclude women from the priesthood 

And so that’s 
Um 
I think that 
That they could change their position on that 

They’d be more intoned with that 

Um 
Lets see 
Actually the Catholic Church 
Well its it’s an interesting situation cause there actual are some priests who are married 
Um 
Sometimes if um 
A man who is previously of a 
Of a different religious faith wants to become a Catholic and a priest and who already is married 
Um 
They actually do allow them to do that 

Which is 
Which I thought was interesting and if they do allow that and some very extreme circumstances 
I wonder 
I wonder why they wouldn’t allow it in general 
Although I do see the argument 
Um 
I do see the validity of the argument against it 
I guess the priest is supposed to devote his whole life to 
To the Church and 
And to god and so 
Um 
And so he needs all his time and his energy to do that 
Although because priests can’t marry and there has been um 
A decline in the number of priests um 
The role of 
Of um 
Deacon’s has become a lot more prominent 
There have been a lot more Deacon’s because they’re allowed to marry 

And really there 
There responsibilities are not 
Are not 
There’s a few major 
There a few major differences but 
Um 
But a lot of their responsibilities are very similar to those of priests 
And so 
So 
So I guess there’s 
There’s a little inconsistency there 
But um 
In terms of the accusations against the Catholic Church with priests and abusing boys and stuff like that 
Um 
It 
I guess in terms of 
I think there 
I mean there have been cases where priests have covered up for other priests or maybe they didn’t investigate as much as they should have 
I 
I think women probably would have 
Would have been more likely to 
To 
To investigate and to 
To reveal probably what was 
What was going on 
Um 
Um 
I’m not 
It’s horrible 
I’m not really sure how they were 
How they let it go on for so long 
But uh 
What am I trying to say 
Um 

Um 
The Catholic Church I think I 
I agree with a lot of their doctrines and their principles and I think that there thoughts on the way we should live in the 21st century are 
Are still 
There thoughts on how we should live are still important 
Still remain even as we are in the 21st century 
Um 
And 
And I think a lot of the stuff 
A lot of the things that the Catholic Church does is 
Is um 
Very helpful and very important in the 21st century 
And then 
But also looking within its own structure there’s probably a lot that could be done 

Um 
A lot 
A lot of changes that could be made that would better reflect society in the 21st century and the 
The changing roles of women 

Yeah
