Um 
No I don’t 

Um 
Because 
Myspace is a public site 
And 
Um 
The information is pretty much out there for anyone to see 
If it was 
If it was posted on like a blog or like an online diary I think that’s one thing 
But 
Considering Myspace if any creepy old guy can go and look at it like then teachers are just as likely to see the information as well 

Well  
Um 
A blog is more personal 
It’s more geared towards writing down your personal thoughts 
Granted it’s still online 
And 
A lot of it is still public 
It’s it’s like different 
Because 
Myspace 
The point of a Myspace is to show information to other people 
And 
Um 
Posting a bulletin also is 
Um 
Putting it out there for everyone on your friends list to see 
And 
So 
Like 
If you’re posting something on a Myspace 
Obviously 
Um 
You weren’t really trying to keep it that confidential 
Because 
A Myspace is a public site 

I think that searching backpacks and lockers and things like that is an invasion of privacy 
Because 
Like 
A backpack is actually something you own 
And 
Although a locker is school property it’s still like you keep your personal items in there 
So I don’t think like searching 
Um 
Searching like a student’s possessions should be allowed 
But 
I think if you go online that’s entirely different 

Um 
On which part 

OK well 
Um 
Like the internet is like anybody can go on it 
Like the Myspace anybody can see whatever you post 
You don’t even have to be somebody’s like friend on Myspace to see what they post 
But 
Like a locker or backpack you don’t put information in there for everyone to see 
It’s like what is 
What belongs to you so 
I don’t 
I think that would be an invasion of privacy 

Um 
Not really
