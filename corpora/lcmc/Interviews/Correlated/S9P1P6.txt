Wait can you repeat the question

O like they said they were going
Gonna

Okay

Um
Well let’s see 
Myspace is on the internet which is 
Very public

Anyone can have access to it
And when people choose to create a Myspace they’re made aware of that any 
Uh
Anyone can see
Um
What’s what you put on there and it’s part of a persons a persons own responsibility to understand that what they put on there can be see by anyone 
And so it’s it’s there and so it’s 
It’s not an invasion of privacy because there’s no illusion that this is a private enterprise
Because it’s not It’s made open to anyone 
Who who joins who joins Myspace 
And 
Um
And so 
Teachers like everyone else can see whatever whatever is on there
And and it’s great if they were able to prevent a school shooting 
Um by doing that

I mean 
Um
Gosh my mother teaches at an elementary school 
And I remember
Last year there was an incident that occurred that having something to do with Myspace 
Um a group of students had formed this sort of
Hate group 
Um 
Directed towards another student in the class 
And the principal became aware of it
And so I forget exactly what the repercussions were
But I think that the students were reprimanded somehow
But then they had a whole big meeting about it with parents 
And teachers
About about Myspace
Um
And the dangers it posses 
And things like that
I mean kids
I mean you just have to be have common sense really
About whatcha your going to 
What what things about yourself you’re going to put on there 
What thoughts to express on there
Because it’s
It’s the internet nothing
Nothing is really secure
And 
Um
I think that teachers have have every right to 
Um
Like everyone else to to 
Um
To to look at whatever it is you’re choosing to put out there

Um
Were you going to say something

In terms of the internet

I mean
Um
Ok well 
They have 
They have the freedom to
To access the internet and to access the internet so I guess 
Then the question would be 
Based on what they find 
On someone’s Myspace or something like that 
What right do they have to then question the student or to look in the student’s locker or something like that 
Because I guess that’s what they probably would have had to have done
Have to do to 
Foil the students plan
Um
And I think 
I think because it’s it’s school property all 
Um
I think all schools have the right to look through a student’s locker
Um
Actually a couple of years ago in my high school 
We had um a lockdown drill
And 
But the purpose of it was so that the school could
Um
So that the police could come in and search for drugs

In in students lockers 
And um 
I mean students shouldn’t shouldn’t be doing anything illegal like that anyway
And I mean if you’re stupid enough to bring anything like that to school with you 

I just think you deserve to get caught
I mean 
Hahah
Maybe that sounds harsh 
Um
And I mean the same thing
If you’re bringing 
If you’re bringing weapons to school 
Or something like that 
I mean these teachers by by taking these actions were able to they were able to prevent a school shooting
I think that’s 
I mean 
Because I mean if you’re if you’re you’re you’re in a school and 
Um 
So there’s 
Uh
Safety is really what’s most important

Um
Safety of of all the students
And so I don’t think that the teachers really did anything wrong
And um
And I’m trying to think what else teachers could do
To invade privacy
Um
I mean like I know
Well coming to college I remember during our orientation I think it was summer orientation
Um
Because I’m a I’m a
Before um freshman year

And I remember people talking they had talked to us about Facebook
Because that’s the big thing now

Facebook
And they said you know I mean
Be smart about what you put on there
Because if you put
I mean if you put up pictures of you
Your drunken escapades on the weekend

And then you
And this is a website on the internet that anyone can 
You know can look at
And then so if you’re trying to get a job and your employers 

See that then 
That’s gonna reflect bad on you 
So I think 
Um
Especially in terms of the internet
Just it’s
It’s 
The person makes the choice to put themselves out there
And put out information about themselves when they know that it’s it’s not secure
And it’s not private and so they shouldn’t have any expectations about security or privacy

And so when a student goes to school they need to understand that safety is one of the most important things for all of the students 
And so they should expect that safety
That the school’s priorities 
That is to keep the children safe 
And so
Some things that may be perceived as invasions of privacy are are necessary

Um
Just in terms of school or in

Uh
No
No I think that’s it
