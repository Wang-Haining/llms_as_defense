Um
I think gender
Um
Discrimination is still an issue
But I think it goes on both ways
I think that a lot of times we still see the
Um
Like the woman in the workplace or something like that
Where they might not be 
Their ideas might not be as accepted
Or 
Um
They might not be treated exactly the same because of they’re not men 
But I think that also people are discriminated
Um
Men who choose to stay at home
And be like the primary care giver basically for their children while their
While their wife goes to work there also discriminated against in the opposite way

Um

Um
I don’t have any specific examples 
But I know that there are some
In that women 
Um
Who hold the same type of position as men may not be given the same benefits
Or 
Um
Maybe treated a little differently because they are women 
For no other reason they might hold the same position but might not be 
Their ideas might not be as well accepted
So

Um
I think a lot of it is personally wise 
I think a lot of its people 
It’s the individual persons view
The people who are discriminating against them
So I don’t know if there is much to change it
Um
If people
Uh yeah were in the same job as you
Your assuming they have the same capabilities as you so I don’t know why you would be discriminated against 

Yeah that they hear the whole thing about mister mom and how that a lot of people discriminate against them because they feel like the men should be the one who go out and work and the women should be taking care of the kids

So when it’s the opposite way people
Um
Men are made fun of because they choose to
Um
Stay home with their kids

Um
No

No
