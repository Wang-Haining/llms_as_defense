Um 
Frankly I’m ok with it actually 
I don’t really see why marijuana has such a large stigma applied to it 
Generally I think the effects aren’t much more harmful then alcohol or tobacco in fact from what I know of it marijuana smoke is at least much cleaner then tobacco smoke 
Um 
At least judging by the stuff they put in tobacco these days 
Last time I checked I think there was small amount percentage of arsenic or something like that 
Um 
Really I think that it’s just more of a social stigma we have applied to it then any actual really long term deleterious effects 
And I think that the Denver law prevents large 
It it still allows officers to enforce against large scale dealing while at the same time it prevents them from having to waste resources on going after ever body who has like 
I don’t I don’t even know how marijuana is measured so 
I can’t give a measurement there but 
For for ever 
For going after everyone who has very small quantities of it 
Which just kind of clogs up the judicial system and wastes the resources of the police 

Un-huh 
I think 
Um 
I don’t know 
I just remember seeing that old goofy movie Reefer Madness from back in the 50’s and it seems to me that it’s just one of those things that’s come to be associated with a specific type of person 
Like it’s the drug of choice of African American’s or of young people or of young radicals and so on and so forth and I think that older generations have tended to keep viewing it that way 
And because of that the laws really haven’t modified been modified to the extent that they should have 

Um 
In general yes 
I mean 
Frankly you don’t hear about people being wife beaters or getting getting into as many accidents because of marijuana smoking 
Um 
It seems to me like from what I know of it that the effects in general are very similar to being drunk 
And it really isn’t 
It doesn’t impair people significantly more then alcohol does 
Again that’s just from what I know of it 
I could be just completely making that up 

Uh 
Not that I can think of off hand
