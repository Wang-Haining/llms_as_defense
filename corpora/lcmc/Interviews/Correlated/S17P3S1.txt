I would say yes 
Because 
Well what can we do to change it 
I guess it’s kind of a deep rooted thing 
Like 
It’s been around for a while 
And 
Traditionally men have had different roles than women 
And 
People still tend to think that maybe women should be inferior to men in certain regards 
Like especially in the work place 
So 
Um 
In order to change it like you have to change the whole way of thinking 
Like 
You have to get people to see from experience that women can do things that men were traditionally 
And 
Also the reverse of that 
That men can do things that women were traditionally supposed to do 
Like raise children 
And 
Things like that 
Um 
So 
I think if people see people doing those things that aren’t traditionally associated with their gender 
Then they’ll be less likely to discriminate against the opposite gender 
Because 
They’ll see that either thing’s possible 

Um 
Well like what exactly 

OK 
Um 
I guess men are seen as like stronger 
And 
Uh 
Sometimes more mentally able 
Especially in math and sciences like it’s still dominated by males 
And 
Women have like a childbirth role 
So 
That therefore they become like the caretakers traditionally 
And 
The housekeepers 
And 
Things like that 
But 
Um 
I guess in the modern day a lot more women are becoming ambitious in the workplace and doing things 
Um 
To advance themselves personally 
And 
I guess less men are probably doing the homemaker role 
But 
I definitely know some who are 
And 
I think that it’s possible for them to do that 

Um 
I wouldn’t say in the workplace 
But 
Probably otherwise like as I said about the 
Um 
Homemaker type role 

OK 
Um 
Well actually I have a good example 
I was 
Um 
In the hospital a couple days ago 
And 
The nurse that I had was a male nurse 
And 
I was really surprised 
And 
I know that 
Um 
A lot of people would probably react the same way 
Um 
Because nurses are usually like a female role 
And 
Doctors are traditionally a male role 

Um 
But 
In that specific case I was actually treated by a female doctor 
And 
I saw a male nurse 
So 
Um 
Things like that do happen from my experience 
But 
Um 
They’re not very common 
When they do happen people are kind of surprised 
But 
I mean really we shouldn’t be surprised 
Because 
We should expect either gender in any situation 
But 
That’s not how we are 

Not really
