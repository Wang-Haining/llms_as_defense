Um 
I feel that it’s fine 
I really don’t understand why marijuana is looked at as such a taboo in the first place 
The example I always use is that 
I mean 
When was the last time you heard of mari 
Father addicted to marijuana his son comes home 
And 
There’s domestic abuse in the house 
Like 
I always joke around that the son would come home 
Kind of realize his dad’s a little groggy 
And 
Then he’d get really happy when his dad treats him to TGI Friday’s
There’s nothing 
You don’t hear 
You hear about people like getting stoned and then doing ridiculous things 
Which happens every week here 
I mean 
I look around 
And 
There’s so many kids getting drunk 
And 
Getting written up in college for 
Like 
Urinating 
Public urination on the wall 
Or 
Like getting in fights in hallways 
And 
Just really idiotic things that aren’t really thought through 
Brought on by alcohol 
But 
I always get the feeling that 
Just from statistics someone here has to be smoking marijuana on a weekend 
And 
You never hear anything about them 
Except if there are other drunk kids in the room as well 
I mean 
They do get written up 
But 
Nothing violent happens 
It’s always just because of the fact that they have marijuana in their room 
It’s like they just got caught for smoking marijuana 
And 
What negative effects could come from that 
I just don’t see any 
Yeah 

Yeah if they like 
They’re just gonna get high 
And 
Hang out 
And 
Eat take out food 
And 
Watch the television 
I mean 
It might not be my idea of a good night out 
But 
Whatever they want to do float their boat 
It doesn’t hurt anyone 
Doesn’t hurt themselves to any great extent 
Unless they decide to be immature 
Which if anyone over twenty one hopefully they’re mature 
I mean they can drink alcohol 
I just don’t think the effects are any worse than alcohol 

Well no 
I don’t think it should be compared with alcohol in any certain sense 
It should be 
Like 
You have to take marijuana 
And 
Look at the cause and effects of just using marijuana 
I mean 
You can use alcohol as a control group 
Because 
Alcohol is legal to drink for people over twenty one 
So 
You can say in a sense that well the effects the negative effects of marijuana do not surpass the negative effects of alcohol 
And 
Alcohol is legal 
So then 
Therefore why not make marijuana legal as well 

Um 
Hmm 
I don’t know how to break that down 
Like 
Um 
If someone 
I don’t know like 
If you 
They spend research time seeing between like how many car crashes 
I don’t know 
Just work with the statistics 
I really don’t know how to 
Just if they can like test marijuana users 
And 
See what like the negative effects of using marijuana 
And 
Run all of the statistics 
Out of how many people that smoke marijuana how many will get this certain illness 
And 
You can use that against like how many people will drink 
How many people will get like liver disease 
And 
If the negative effects of marijuana aren’t worse than alcohol 
And 
Alcohol is legal then that means marijuana should be legal too 

Uh 
Nope
