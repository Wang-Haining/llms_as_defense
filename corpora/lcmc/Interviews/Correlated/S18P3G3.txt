Um 
I don’t 
I haven’t really made up my mind on this matter yet 
So 
I can’t say if either side is right or wrong 
But 
I do believe this is the trickiest topic we’re facing today 
Because 
Something so close between separation of church and state 
And 
How to define marriage is something that is very tricky to do without offending anyone 
So 
I don’t know I think 
I think that the 
All civil unions 
I don’t know whether marriage should be looked at 
And 
Like 
Defined by the government 
Seeing as it is a sacrament like considered 
Well people wouldn’t get tax breaks 
Or 
Looked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized 
And 
So 
If you’re married I think they should just look at it as a civil union 
Because 
That’s what it is 
It’s two people 
They shouldn’t have separation of church and state 
They shouldn’t look into like well what kind of marriage was it 
Two people got unioned together 
So 
And 
The fact that gay marriage 
I mean 
That would just 
Oh two people you got a civil union 

Um 
Well if all the states can come to a like logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law 
But 
A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous 
It is 
Something like the constitution shouldn’t just be amended for something 
I mean it is a very big cause for certain people 
But 
It’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment 

It’s just not important enough to amend the constitution 
To define 
To ban gay marriage 
Simply put 

Uh 
No
