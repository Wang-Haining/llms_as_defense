No 
I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy at all because anything that you put on the internet is basically fair game for anyone to see 
And like cause that’s why it’s called the World Wide Web 
And Myspace has basically no security on it whatsoever 
So I think in a way him posting message about the possible shooting he was going to attempt was his way of reaching out for help because obviously someone’s gonna see it because it’s for everyone to view 
Um 
And let’s see 
So 
Yeah 
Like do you want me to continue talking about specifically the Myspace or ? 
Ok 
Um 
So yeah I guess if officials were checking out their students 
Um to see about their standings on whether they’re gonna commit crimes or not 
I feel like if you do anything on a computer that has no security towards it that it’s perfectly legal for anyone to view it and 
Um 
I’d actually almost go so far as to like encourage to go ahead and look at students’ Myspaces because often kids will post things thinking that they’re being cool if they like tell people certain things 
But it can actually really maybe reveal some inner troubles that they’re dealing with 
And they can have help 
Um 
When people who are like older than them such as like school officials find it out and maybe the student is just too shy to ask for help or doesn’t really realize what is wrong with them 
But like maybe the counselor sees something on a Myspace page 
Then um 
Maybe they’ll realize oh this student really has some issues 
Maybe I should talk with them and it’s kind of like a way of seeking help 
In my opinion 
Yeah 
I feel like if there’s no security on a particular site that it’s perfectly fair game for anyone to look at it 
And school officials are fine to look at it cause 
I mean you always want to make sure that in a school setting people are stable and school shootings don’t happen 
So 
Um 
I think the line should be if the site 
On for a computer has privacy settings and that student has set the privacy settings 
Then they should be honored even if there is a way for the school official to tap into it and get around it 
Because the student obviously feels that they’re secure in expressing their thoughts and perhaps they are already seeking help and they’re just talking to a friend 
Telling them like what they’re dealing with and they don’t really want everyone in the entire world to know 
Um 
So, I don’t think that should be violated 
And then I guess you can reach that out beyond the computer 
Onto like phone conversations 
I know that a lot of times now phone conversations are monitored if certain words are said like President and I guess like bomb or something 
And I feel like maybe there should be some criteria that should be monitored when certain words are brought up in conversations 
But on the whole I don’t think that anyone on particular should just be zeroed in upon and just be like oh this could be a random person and maybe they’re telling something to someone that’s like really private 
When privacy should be invaded? 
Um 
I guess it would be beneficial again like if someone’s having problems and they’re too insecure with themselves or shy to ask for help and someone else realizes it 
Then it would be beneficial for their privacy to be invaded because someone could go to them and be like listen, I know that you’re having something problems 
And like I’m here to help 
So that could be helpful 
Or if there was I guess a crime committed and people were communicating by phone like what they’re plan was gonna be or something that they’ve done and people were listening into it 
Like the government 
Then that would be helpful because that would prevent those people from preventing a crime again or even from doing it in the first place and keeping the majority of society safer 
Um 
Not really 
Just that I guess in some cases 
In like normal scenarios 
It should be honored if you want your privacy 
But in other cases like such as if someone is suspicious to begin with 
Then maybe they should be monitored for a while before they’re proven to be trustworthy again 
Hmm 
No, not really
