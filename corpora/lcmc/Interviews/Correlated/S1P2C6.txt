Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change 
Um 
Their views 
I think that a lot of 
They have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things 
Um 
Within the case of I know  
Um 
Like gay marriages 
Within the case of abortion 
Within the case of birth control 
Things like that 
I 
Um 
The Catholic Church has very 
Has strong views on them which is fine 
But they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways 
So I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they 
Wouldn’t be worried about loosing their following 
Um 
Well I’ve heard there’s a lot of 
Um 
People are starting to 
Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their 
Um 
The way that they see these situations 
And 
Um 
People are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects 
So I feel they feel that 
Um 
That 
The Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things 
Yeah 
I mean  
Um 
The Catholic Church is against abortion 
So if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong 
And that you were going against it 
Um 
Well 
I mean the same I guess with 
Um  
Gay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in 
And that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about 
Um 
You might not 
Want to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  
Um 
I don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married 
But I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened 
I mean I don’t know 
Eh 
I don’t know if they 
Um 
They might not have 
Just done that if they 
I mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests 
But I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it 
Um 
Well I mean that was something they did 
And 
That was something that 
Um 
I don’t know 
That a whole 
That was something they did 
And it might 
Didn’t really seem to 
Be affected 
I mean 
If they were married would they have done it differently 
It’s hard to really tell 
Yeah 
Um 
Well I don’t see why there 
Priests can’t be married  
I mean 
The Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God 
And they’re devoted their complete life 
But I don’t see 
Everyone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life 
And the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both 
No
