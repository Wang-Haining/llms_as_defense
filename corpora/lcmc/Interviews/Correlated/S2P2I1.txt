Um 
Well I kinda supported it at first 
But um 
Now that we’ve been over there so long and were kind of not making any progress I think its about time to either wrap it up and 
I mean do what we can and pull out 
Or something else 
But um 
I mean I have 
I have a brother that’s a already been over there twice 

He joined the Marines 
Uh 
A few years ago 
And he already completed and returned from his second tour of duty 
So um 
I don’t know if that kind of a affects my view 
But I definitely think that its kind of come to a standstill over there 

Well 
Cause maybe I don’t want to see him go over there for a third tour 
Cause I think he’s lucky enough to come back twice without any scrapes or bruises or anything 

Um 
But yeah I don’t think were making a whole lot of progress over there 
I think its about done 
What we’ve 
You know 
We’ve done what we can over there 

Um 
I think its gone on long enough 
I think anything we 
We could have done over there 
Um 
I mean has been done 
I think our goals are a little 
Um 
I guess I’d say farfetched or whatever 
But it seems like they’re they’re too difficult to complete 
Um 
It seems that the people over there have 
You know 
One mind 
And ah 
It doesn’t seem like we’re going to make progress much more progress staying over there 

Um 
Well we’re trying to like form a democracy and everything 
And kinda like change the way of life over there 
Um 
And I mean 
Even 
Even with the progress we’ve made and 
I mean the news doesn’t elaborate a lot of what’s going on exactly 
But um 
I mean there’s fighting everyday and it seems that the people aren’t 
Ah 
I guess assimilating or aren’t accepting 
You know 
What were trying to give them 
So 
It seems kinda pointless to continue 

Um 
Not really
