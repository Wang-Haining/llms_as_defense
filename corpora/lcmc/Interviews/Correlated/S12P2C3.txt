Um I do think the catholic church needs to adapt it’s ways and modernize 
Um 
One of the biggest areas that’s apparent is just science 
And 
They’ve set their ways 
And 
Their fundamental beliefs almost two thousand years ago 
Building into you know the second millennia 
And 
A lot of that stuff is rooted in the way they perceived the natural world at that given time 
And 
Since then we have been given the ability through their so called this god to be able to update our scientific knowledge 
And 
Explain more natural happenings 
So 
I think the church should come along with that 
I mean 
Under their belief system we’re all created by god and thus given the reason and brain that god gave us 
So 
If we use his gifts to come up with the scientific knowledge I think it should be recognized by the church 
Um 
That way it can be seen as not a hindrance to the church 
But 
Maybe an advancement to the human race 
And 
Yeah 

Um 
I think if they would have allowed priests to marry there would have been a significantly less a less amount of any of that activity just 
Because 
Whatever urges or what not they would have been better controlled 
Because 
They wouldn’t have been living a life of solitude 
They would have had a partner 
So I think in that sense it definitely would have decreased the activity 
But 
I don’t know if that necessarily 
I think they’d have to do it in a manner where 
‘cause 
It seems the life of a priest is sort of to set an example with certain values that other people should live by 
So 
As long as they still preserve those values I think maybe they should have update the whole idea of priests being able to marry 
But 
As long as those values that they were trying to convey through priests not being able to marry and such were still conveyed I think it would be alright 

Um 
That’s it
