No I don’t think so 
Because 
Um 
Well first of all like the internet’s public 
And 
Anyone has access to use it 
Or 
To read it 
Um 
And 
Also 
The reason that it was looked at was because it was seen as a threat 
And 
It could have been very harmful if they hadn’t uncovered that threat 
So 
If anything seems like it could be possibly harmful to other people to like the country to anything like that 
Um 
It definitely needs to be looked into 
Because 
It’s regarding people’s safety 
And 
Safety should be of the utmost importance 
So 
Even though someone might argue that they’re losing their privacy 
It’s probably losing their privacy at the expense of possibly other people’s lives or safety 
So 
It’s definitely worth it 
Um 
People also probably think they have more right to privacy than they actually do 
Like it’s not a constitutional right to have privacy 
But 
People come to expect it 
And 
They get really mad when someone takes that away from them 
And 
I mean I’m not saying that you should just invade people’s privacy for no reason 
But 
If you do have a reason 
Then 
Uh 
You should look into it 
You could help people by avoiding potentially dangerous situations 

Um 
If they have a reason to suspect something harmful going on 
Then I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy that should be prevented 
I think that should be encouraged 
Um 
Because 
We don’t want harmful things to happen 
But 
If they just like are snooping around for no reason 
That’s not really necessary 
And 
There’s no point in doing that  

Um 
Do you have anything in particular?  

OK 
Um 
I guess just depending on how many other people it would influence 
Uh 
If they suspect that someone’s plotting something against say an entire school 
Well that could influence the whole group of students at that school 
All their parents 
Everybody who knows those people 
That would be a major thing for 
Um 
Like in the situation you described 
But 
It’s not reasonable for school officials to just 
You know 
Think someone’s 
Uh 
I don’t know 
Like 
Cheating on a test or something 
And 
Like explore their whole background 
And 
Everything about them for a reason like that 
I think the main distinction would be whether people’s lives and safety are jeopardized by a situation 
And 
If they are then it’s ok to invade privacy 
And 
If it’s not then don’t do it 

Nope
