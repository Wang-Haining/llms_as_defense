Um 
On this one also I’m like really mixed 
I have really mixed feelings about 
Um 
Just the fact that they call it gay marriage 
Like I think that marriage is between a man and a woman 
It’s a religious sacrament 
And like that’s just what it is 
And you can’t really change the meaning of it 
Like you can’t say that it 
Cause it’s like 
It’s like pretty much solely meant for like procreation 
Like the word marriage 
And like that’s not obviously what gays would be doing 
And I’m not sure if I agree with calling it gay marriage 
I have no problem with them just being like recognized by the state as a married couple 
Like as a couple that’s together 
I have no problem with that 
Um 
I just 
It’s the fact that they call it marriage that bothers me 
And I think that 
Um 
I think they’re main concern is just being recognized 
And I just think that 
I mean it sounds funny 
But they should even come up with like 
Just another word for it 
And like 
Um 
I think that they really want to be recognized by the church 
And I’m really not sure why because I mean 
It’s not that God has said that he’s against gay people 
He’s just like 
Like in religion like they’re 
The church is against gay acts 
So unless you’re a gay couple that doesn’t engage in homosexual acts then 
I mean you shouldn’t get 
You shouldn’t you know 
Be married 
Like cause it’s not accepted by the church and I don’t really know why they want to be accepted by the church if it feels that way 
So that kind of confuses me 
Um 
Um 
So I don’t know 
If they came up with like another word or another way that they could just be recognized by everyone that they’re a couple and whatever 
I think that’s fine 
I have no problem with that 
But it’s just the marriage thing that throws me off 
And that’s really it 
No I don’t 
I don’t think the government should have any ruling over the personal lives of people 
Like we have 
I mean I’m pretty sure they have much larger things to worry about whereas this could be taken care of by just another part 
Like it doesn’t have to be the President who like makes a law about it 
I think that’s really stupid 
I don’t think it’s any of their business 
Um 
And I really don’t 
I really don’t think a lot of people care what he thinks about it 
Um 
Especially knowing like his stance on religion and how conservative he is 
I think everyone knows you know what he would think 
But um 
Yeah I don’t think they should have any say in it because it’s not 
I just don’t think it’s any of their business 
Um 
I think they should be more focused on what’s going on with the things in Iraq and just other things that they should just do their job 
So I think that’s just 
I think people just want to know like what President Bush is thinking just so they can get more angry at them 
And I don’t think 
I think it’s stupid 
So 
Yeah 
Um 
Um 
I just think that for some reason like I know people hate Bush and I think they just like to see 
Like just get a rise out of him and see what he’s thinking about it 
Just so they can like go against it 
But I really 
I really don’t think it’s any of the government’s business 
I think this is between the gays and the church and they’re pretty much battling it out just to be recognized as married 
But I don’t see why they want to because the church doesn’t accept them 
I mean like 
They do accept them as people 
But not with what they do 
So I don’t understand why they would want to be recognized like by the church 
Um 
So 
I don’t know 
That just really confuses me and kind of gets me angry 
Like if the 
I don’t understand why they would want some institution to recognize them if the institution doesn’t accept them for what they’re doing 
Like they’re cause 
So I don’t know 
That just throws me off 
So 
No 
Ok
