Uh 
I don’t think so because Myspace is 
Is a pretty public thing 
I’m not sure 
I’ve never had a Myspace before but I’m pretty sure you can just go on there and look at anyone’s Myspace and stuff like that 

If they were to like delve into a more personal kind of information 
Um 
Whether its like 
Um 
Like a letter or something that the person sent I would say that’s an invasion of privacy but 
But a Myspace I don’t really think so 

Well Myspace is 
I mean 
Public 
That’s why it was made basically to 
To put your information out there and for a lot of people to see and its 
I said its like opposite to privacy the person who made it really wants everyone to see all that stuff  that they put on there 

Um 
Well I definitely thing they should be able to use any 
Um 
Public kind of forum type thing like Myspace or Facebook or things like that to um 
At least for good reasons like preventing a school shooting 
Um 
I would say they shouldn’t be able to delve into more private things like maybe 
Uh 
Um 
I don’t know like private conversations or written down like something in like a a private like diary that’s found or something 
I would say that’s an invasion of privacy 
But I don’t think Myspace or Facebook or any of those public 
Uh 
Website things or forums or anything 
I think 
Uh 
That should be 
That should be able to be used legally and legitimately 

Well 
Um 
To use like a personal diary or to find something in somebody’s locker 
I mean that’s 
That’s a definite invasion of someone’s privacy because the person who keeps like a diary or 
You know 
Has a locker or whatever 
Doesn’t expect people to go in there and look at the stuff in there or read the stuff in there or anything like that but someone making a Myspace or putting a Facebook 
I mean you don’t know whose looking at that at all 
So anything you put on there 
Um  
Its really up in the air for anyone to see 

Uh no
