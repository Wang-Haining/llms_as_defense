I did 
Mmhmm 
Just talk into it? 
Ok 
Ok cool 
Uh huh 
Uh 
Ok I’m sorry 
Ok 
How I feel about the War in Iraq 
Let me see 
Um 
At this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually 
And I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. 
Like who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven 
So I don’t feel like 
I mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq 
So I don’t like keep up with it 
I don’t know the big details of it 
But at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing 
And then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them 
But it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset 
So 
And then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day 
And then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves 
Um 
Let me see 
Ohh this is so hard 
This is the one topic I don’t know anything about 
Um 
War in Iraq 
Oh this hard 
Uh 
Mmm 
Uhh I don’t know 
Do you have anything else I can go off of? 
Ok 
Thank you 
Um 
Well um 
Actually I think 
I think the war should continue because it’s not fair 
I don’t think we should call it a war anymore 
But because I don’t think that 
You know 
I think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that 
You know 
That we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns 
But I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore 
Because like we didn’t even call it 
It shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place 
Because it never was declared a war by congress 
I think that’s how the whole thing works 
You have to declare a war by congress 
And then it’s 
I just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try 
Actually no 
I do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them 
But it’s also like wasting our resources 
And especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like 
It’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now 
Because of like what it’s doing and it’s like 
And what it’s doing to like 
Cause remember 
I think with the whole Vietnam thing 
Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war 
And he’s like saying 
He’ll be called like that president forever 
That he started this meaningless war and stuff 
So 
Huh 
You have to make this a half an hour don’t you? 
Uh 
Ok yeah 
Um 
Huh 
I guess you could also say that it is 
Like it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in 
Whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like 
These people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took 
I bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school 
Anymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other 
Just because of like the different beliefs that they have 
But then again 
It’s like 
It’s hard to say 
I want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States 
That it’s going to be even worse for them 
And it’s going to be 
Like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them 
And they’ve been going on this whole like 
Um 
Totalitarian 
Like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that 
You know 
I feel like it’s gonna 
That it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there 
So I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years 
Hmm 
That’s about it 
Ok
