Um 
I am against the war 
I really don’t think that we should be there anymore 
Um 
We entered into the war on totally convoluted terms like there wasn’t really any reason for us to go in 
We should have done more research before we went 
Um 
Cause George Bush’s whole reason for going in was like oh well Osama Bin Laden has weapons of massive destruction 
Um 
And they’re gonna attack us just like they attacked the 
Um 
Twin towers 
And that wasn’t even like the case 
It was totally different groups that attacked us on nine eleven 
And there were no weapons of mass destruction that we found 
And I feel that like us going in there and just kind of ripping apart their society and trying to reform it 
I mean in a way it’s good because they’re starting to be more formalized 
But we’ve lost so many soldiers to a cause that really didn’t have anything to do with us 
And I feel like the federal government under George Bush is kinda feeling that oh well we need to fix this society and we need to fix that society 
And oooh we just had this happen to us so let’s use this excuse to go over there 
And I realize he states, oh well I got false information from my own intelligence
But, you shouldn’t just go by one or two people and you should do more research 
And a lot of the United Nations was against us going in and invading Iraq 
So that should even say something 
And it’s really difficult for us to pull out now because if we pull out too soon then the society will collapse 
And they’re making so much progress right now which is good because hopefully in the near future we can pull out 
But, it’s just if we do pull out too soon and the timing isn’t right then just kind of like Afghanistan with Russia 
It’s just gonna totally like collapse and make things a lot worse and 
So we just have to be really careful 
But I also feel like we need to come out as soon as we can because we’re just losing so many soldiers over there 
I feel the war has definitely gone on long enough 
Um 
Iraq is now 
I think from what I heard collecting people into a government and they’re forming their own army 
And I definitely feel that we should be taking soldiers away from them slowly versus adding them 
And I know it’s tricky, but we need to find a way to get our men out of there because that’s not really any longer our place to be 
We need a 
We need to bring them home 
So hopefully with the new upcoming President they’ll be a form or plan put into place to slowly take our men away from Iraq 
Mmm no
