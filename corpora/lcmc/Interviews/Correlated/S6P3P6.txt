No 
I kind of see Myspace as being a big bulletin board hanging in the middle of the internet 
Whatever you post there can essentially be seen by anyone else 
Unless you mark your profiles private and I don’t know the details of the case 
Um 
Really I just think Myspace is a bad idea in general 
I think it encourages all kinds of internet voyeurism 
And I think that 
It’s becoming a growing trend which is kind of scary 
But I think to post your ideas and plans on the internet and then expect people like school officials to not go looking for them or to not find them is is ridiculous 
And so I don’t think it can be considered private if your going around posting it online 
You know 

Um 
I think that school officials have the right to do a reasonable amount of investigation to prevent school shootings and that kind of thing 
Um 
If somebody shouted down the hallway that they planned to bring a gun to school the next day then of course school officials would act 
If a note fell under their hands from one kid to another saying the same thing of course they would be obliged to act 
But they wouldn’t necessarily go looking to find the note 
I think that they 
Like I said I don’t know the details of the case but I think that they were probably directed to this Myspace a particular Myspace profile or bulletin board or whatever it was by someone else 
And I think that’s an acceptable way for them to go 
I 
Like I said 
I don’t think you can consider anything you post on Myspace private 
Anyone can access that information 
Even if you do use the privacy option which is supposed to filter out people you don’t want looking at your profile 
There’s 
From what I understand its still not that hard to get through that privacy block 
So really I I really just think its ridiculous to expect that other people wouldn’t see something you post on the internet 

Um 
I’m not that up on Supreme Court Juries prudence and all that 
But my understanding is that there’s a distinction 
A great aided distinction between what’s considered a private sphere and what’s considered a public sphere 
And I think that school officials need to recognize the same distinction 
Um 
Obviously I I think posting online is in a public forum and therefore it’s acceptable for them to go looking at that kind of thing 
Just as if someone posted on a bulletin board or announced it in class or so on and so forth 
Um 
But I think there’s a difference between that and private communications like email or letters or phone calls things like that 
And I think that’s the kind of distinction that needs to be drawn there 

Um 
No 
That’s about it
