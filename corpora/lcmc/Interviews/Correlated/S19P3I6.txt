Um 
I feel as though it’s gone on long enough 
And 
That it should be over by now 

Um 
Just because it’s basically been a pointless war 
Nothing’s been gained on either side 
It’s obvious that the Iraqis don’t want us in their country 
Because they keep killing our soldiers 
They don’t want our help 
Most Middle Eastern countries aren’t fond 
Most countries in general aren’t fond of the United States 
Because 
Of their tendency to get involved in conflicts that they don’t really have any business being involved in 
And 
I feel as though soldiers are just getting killed for no reason at this point 
And 
That they just should be able to come home now 

Um 
Just 
Because 
I don’t think it’s fair to leave them over there to fight a war that isn’t going anywhere 
Um 
I think that Bush is starting to realize that he made a bad decision 
But 
I think that he’s so far in that he doesn’t want to admit he was wrong 
And 
Since no progress has been gained 
It’s just wasting our tax dollars 
And 
Taking innocent lives 
I think that it’s just 
There’s no point to it anymore 
It should just end 

It’s definitely gone on long enough 

Um 
Just 
Because 
Once again it’s just been a big waste of money 
Um 
We haven’t gained anything by it 
Sadam Hussein has already been taken out of the country 
He’s been out for years now 
And 
Nothing’s being gained 
There’s really no point in being there anymore 
Like 
They don’t want our help 
They don’t want a democratic government 
They don’t like us 
It’s over 

No
