Um 
Well 
A 
Me personally 
I’m not opposed to gay marriage 
Um 
I think 
I mean 
I think 
Um 
Whether you’re born that way or you know whatever 
I don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made 
So I think that people 
You know 
Gay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever 
Um 
So 
I 
I think 
I think its wrong to 
To say 
A man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really 
Um 
(pause) 
I haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but 
Uh um 
Yeah I would definitely say its 
its wrong for them to say that 

Um 
Well it seems that its 
Its not so much like a choice 
Like they they don’t really have a choice on how they are 
Like um 
I mean 
Like 
I was born straight 
And you know another person is born gay I guess 
It doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that 
That they should be held responsible for 
If you know what I mean 

Um 
(pause, clears throat) 
Ah yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that 
I don’t really 
I don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a 
Um 
I don’t think its like a legal issue 
I 
I don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue 
Um 
I mean 
Again like I don’t think these like gay people should be 
Um 
How do I say 
Ah 
Um 
Should be like put 
Like I mean like 
On a stage like they’re 
You know 
Like its wrong 
Like 
Like 
That they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever 

So I don’t think the federal government really has any say 

Um 
Its hard 

(laughs) 
Um 
Ok 
Well 
Um 
I don’t think the federal government should be involved because its 
I mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like 
It just seems like they’re outta place 
It doesn’t seem like they have any right to 
To interject in people’s lives 
And 
And you know 
That’s just who they are 
The 
Who 
Who um 
You know 
Gay people 
That’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think 
And I mean its 
They shouldn’t be punished for that 

Uh no 
That’s it
