Um 
I think we did a stupid stupid thing going into it the way that we did 
Which is without the support of the UN or practically any other country in the world 
Um 
We were misinformed as has been recently discovered with the lack of weapons of mass destruction 
And 
I think before you go in and start a war you had probably better make sure that there’s a good reason for justifying it 
Because 
To go into a country and invade it and spend billions of dollars to wreck the lives of people there and ship people overseas 
Um 
There just better be a good reason that is threatening to life 
Um 
About the war now it’s more difficult 
Because 
Once we’re in it it’s a different situation 
You can’t just say oh well we just should have never gotten into it in the first place so we should just pull out and leave everything alone and let them solve it themselves 

Um 
I think part of that’s true 
I think uh 
Trying to solve Iraq’s problems for them isn’t going to go well 
Like 
Um 
Imposing a new system of government and everything 
I mean it’s one thing to say we’re doing what we think is in the best interest of the Iraqi people 
But 
It’s an entirely different culture 
And 
Do we really know 
I just don’t really think so 
Um 
I think there were a lot of more underground motives like oil 

Stuff like that 
Reasons for going in that were not great motives for completely disrupting another people’s way of life 
I mean 
Granted we didn’t like it 
It’s against everything we believe 
The dictatorship 
The like 
Um 
The laws they had to obey the punishments were unreasonable to us 
But 
I mean when do you really have a call to say that is what one country to another 
If it was a UN situation like everyone in the world decides that something horrible is going on in Iraq 
And 
We all need to work together to fix it then maybe this whole thing could have been avoided 

Well wasn’t the war technically declared over 
I mean 
Um 
I seem to remember this who big thing with Bush saying oh the war is over 
Our troops will be coming home soon 

And 
Nobody’s home 

And 
People are still going over 
So 
Um 
Well the war’s technically over 
And 
Rebuilding is the whole process that’s going on now and everything 
Um 
It’s not my call to say if the war should continue or not 
Because 
It’s going to continue 
It has been continuing even after it stopped 
I mean 
I don’t know what we could do about it except not make ourselves a target by not being over there anymore 
Because 
Soldiers over there are just being targets for the insurgents or whatever they call them now 
Um 
Whether we should come home or not 
I think soldiers should come home 
I think the military weapons should come home 
I think the tanks should come home 
I think the hummers should come home 
I think all of the military stuff should go home 
And 
This should get resolved diplomatically 
Because 
That’s the only way it’s going to stick 
Um 
I’m not even I’m not even sure why we’re still over there right now 
I mean 
Protecting contractors and stuff who are rebuilding is one thing 
But 
I don’t know 
I think all of that stuff needs to come home 
And 
We need some third party intervention between us and Iraq 
Because 
I just don’t think we’re communicating well at all as two countries 

Um 
I think a lot of wrong has been done on both sides 
And 
This obviously hasn’t been a good experience for anyone 
It doesn’t have a result really 
OK 
Um 
We removed Saddam Hussein from power 
But 
The same kind of stuff is still going on 
Because 
The people in the country still enforce the same laws  
I mean some of them 
Because 
You know it’s the way you’ve spent your whole life 
And 
You believe in this 
And 
You’re leader is becoming a martyr for this 
And 
I’ve heard it compared to Vietnam 
And 
I think it is a little bit 
And 
I think once we pull out of Iraq completely which is inevitable it will be like Vietnam 
And 
Everything we’ve done will just fall apart 

Nope
