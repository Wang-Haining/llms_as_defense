Alright 
Mmhmm 
Ok 
No I don’t think it’s an invasion of privacy 
Especially because the internet is a free-for-all 
And I really do think that 
I think that for school officials is 
They should be more 
I mean it’s Ok for school officials 
I know even at my high school they had 
Um 
Like they had Myspaces and they had Facebooks just to check up on what students were saying 
And, yes, I mean it’s an invasion of privacy in the sense that that’s a place for kids to go on 
Like go somewhere and not 
And just say whatever they want because the whole idea of having like a diary is out the window because someone can actually find your diary 
And like nine times out of ten your parents can go into your room and find your diary 
Your parents can’t hack onto the computer 
Hack into like the Myspace, find out what’s your password is and find out what you’re saying 
Like very few parents can actually do that 
So I think that’s just like a place where kids can just kinda go and say whatever they need to say and have whoever they like whatever they have on their mind like say it 
But for things like that 
Like saying preventing like a school shooting 
If there’s any like 
Things like that are like necessary 
If you see 
If you see on Myspace someone saying anything about killing someone 
Killing themselves 
Anything that would hurt someone 
Yes, that’s Ok because kids should know that the internet is like a big free-for-all 
And so people can see it 
But when they want to do 
When they want to say like 
Oh like 
I don’t know teenage problems nowadays 
But any small teenage problem that they may have and put it like online 
But as long as it’s not hurting themselves or anyone else 
I think that’s fine 
But like in my old high school 
Can we talk about stuff like this? 
Ok 
At my old high school these girls got 
Um expelled 
Because it was an all-girls Catholic high school and they were in the bathroom 
Um 
With the school uniform on like just doing like 
I guess you could call it sexual female on female like actions or whatever 
But it was like 
The thing is like people do stuff like that all the time 
Even in teachers’ faces they did it 
But the fact is like they put it online 
And for everyone to see 
And so the reason why they got expelled 
And I think that’s actually not fair because it is a free 
It’s like 
I mean how do they know that like 
I think the main thing is that they were messing with the school’s reputation and they didn’t want the school to be known as a place that accepts 
Um 
Like gay 
Gay interactions like that 
Which is understandable 
But it’s also like 
You know 
Then tell them not to go on the internet 
And tell them not to put whatever they want on the internet 
It’s like and now like the more and more 
You know 
School officials get keen to this the more and more like 
Cause kids nowadays are really, really smart 
And they will find a way to make sure that you don’t know their information 
And there are so many ways like people will have to 
If you can like be on a college campus and people have ways of selling fake ID’s 
There are ways in which 
Like the school officials know they’re selling 
But they don’t know who’s doing it because like the students are so secretive 
Imagine what can happen online and imagine what can happen through technology 
Like a lot of kids are really, really smart about things nowadays 
And if they don’t want you to find something, they’ll make sure you don’t find it 
And I feel like 
I think like that 
Um 
School officials are just trying to, yes, keep everyone safe 
But you know if you had us sometimes like 
Cause the fact that like I’m a RA 
Actually and it’s like my motto’s like if you can’t beat em join em 
And it’s like 
And I’m an RA as a freshman 
And so like if you can’t 
They’re 
The freshman are gonna drink regardless of what you say 
So you might as well understand that they’re gonna do it and help them do it 
And I think that leads to the whole thing with this whole privacy issue 
Like be open to them 
Don’t like be like this big school figure that is 
You know they’re not gonna want to talk to you 
Like be like that person that they can come and talk to you cause nine times out of ten if they have someone to come talk to 
They wouldn’t have to write that online 
Like do they even know that that person’s gonna really like kill people at school 
And it’s sad cause like nine times 
The reason probably why like they got like to immediate action was the whole thing with like V-tech and stuff like that 
But they don’t really know and I think it’s because of these people it’s understandable 
It’s really hyped up now 
And that person 
Whoever did that 
He should have been smart 
But obviously it might have been like he really was gonna do it 
But it’s also like you know 
You gotta give people 
Like give teenagers that little space cause that’s like what they need at that time 
They just need that space to kinda grow and develop their own ideas 
Well I think that they should draw the line at the fact that 
Um 
If the students are not going to harm themselves or harm anyone else than it’s fine 
If they want to just express who they are 
Express you know 
Just express things that they probably couldn’t do elsewhere 
Just stuff like that is Ok 
As long as it doesn’t go into hurting themselves and other people 
Then that’s fine 
Like it’s Ok just to say like 
To do like what I think the girls at my high school did 
And just like you know 
Did some 
Even people in college do like sexual girl on girl actions 
But they don’t necessarily mean it 
But they do it 
So I feel like stuff like that is Ok 
But when it comes to possibly 
I feel it’s Ok for what the school officials did because they didn’t know if it was true or if it was false 
So that was Ok 
But you know they also 
They gotta 
It’s Ok to draw the line there 
But anything past that 
Anything past just going on there and checking stuff out and just coming back to school and saying well I saw this on your Myspace 
That’s not right 
They’re there to put like Myspace and Facebook 
They’re there so kids can put up whatever they’re feeling 
Nope 
Ok
