Yeah 
Um 
Yes I think they definitely do because back when they were figuring out what to do society was so much different and so many things weren’t 
Just so many ideas weren’t like developed enough for them to make accurate rules and everything or even like social norms 
So I think it definitely has to change 
Um 
Hmm 
Um 
I don’t know 
Um 
I really don’t know 
Um rules like 
I guess like 
Um 
Even like birth control and things like that 
Um 
I think that definitely has to I mean change 
Like I 
Abortion I’m totally against 
But um 
Ways to prevent pregnancy or anything like that I think has to be taken into consideration 
Um 
Because of 
I don’t know like 
I don’t know 
Um 
Ok 
Um 
Hmm 
Um 
Hmm 
I really have no idea 
I’m like blanking 
Um 
I have no idea 
Um 
Hmm 
I don’t know 
I’m absolutely drawing a blank 
Um 
I think 
I don’t think allowing female priests would of helped avoid that problem 
Um 
But definitely allowing them to marry I think would have helped to avoid it 
Um 
I don’t see why they can’t 
And I also don’t see why women can’t be priests 
Um 
Like even back when 
You know like 2000 years ago when they were doing this I think 
Um 
Like many of the women 
Um 
Like that are 
Many women are mentioned in the Bible that are like so 
You know like a part of everything 
And even back then there were women priests 
So I really don’t understand why they can’t be 
Um 
I think they should 
I don’t understand why they can’t 
Um 
I mean they didn’t back then because I guess they were giving their life to God so I guess they really didn’t have time for a family or anything like that 
But um 
I don’t 
I don’t understand that whole married to God thing 
Um 
I think you can also give your life to your occupation and your beliefs as well as have a family and share it with them 
So I don’t 
I think that they should marry and I think that would still be fine 
So 
Um 
Hmm 
No 
Um 
No not really 
No
