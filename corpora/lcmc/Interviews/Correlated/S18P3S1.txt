Well gender discrimination is 
I mean 
Discrimination I feel is always gonna 
Will always exist 
Because 
There’s just basic differences between like how people are identified 
And 
It’s 
In the workplace today I don’t think 
Uh 
Are you taking specifically about women I’m assuming 

OK 
Yeah well I think right now these days is very 
It’s decreased a lot as far as like unjust practices in the workplace or in public 
But 
Um 
There’s always going to be a past about like 
What people 
How people acted in the past 
And 
Even 
Um 
Like 
As a satire like the media will have like satirize what people used to act like in the office 
Like 
Gender discrimination 
Like 
Negatively towards women 
And 
I don’t know 
As long as it already happened so you’ll never be able to eradicate it completely 

Well yeah 
Well I mean 
It seems kinda silly 
But 
There’s a difference between a boy and a girl and a man and a woman 
Like physical differences 
And 
There’s mental differences as well 
But 
It’s harder to like seek those out 
And 
To find those 
Like 
More explicitly 
But 
Just the basic fact that like 
In the physical sense 
Like 
The brain will like see that before anything else 
And 
You’ll just look at 
Be able to look at someone 
And 
Then you’ll have all these preconceived notions about how that sex is sup 
How the member of that sex is supposed to act 
Like 
Just from what you were taught as a kid 

Um 
Just don’t act on 
I mean like 
People have these thoughts 
But 
They can choose how they decide to react to those thoughts 
I mean now I think 
It used to just be 
It shouldn’t be a problem in the fact that it was maybe fifty years ago with gender discrimination in the office 
I think 
Most of that’s been completely eradicated 
And 
We just need to continue on the path of thinking before we act 
And 
Not letting any preconceived notions about the opposite sex get in the way of our actions 

Um 
No 

No 

You said 
Can you repeat the question?

Oh I thought you said that I am ever discriminated against 

Um 
Probably 
I haven’t witnessed 
Or 
I haven’t 
Up until the point of this conversation I haven’t really thought about that too extensively 
But 
I don’t know 
In the same sense if there is a majority of women in 
Working for a certain job 
Like 
Male nurses they probably get discriminated against 
‘Cause 
Historically it started out as purely female nurses 
And 
That would be one example 
And 
Even like in movies today 
Like in 
Uh 
I forget what movie it was 
But 
Like 
The whole joke basing around the main character that he’s a male nurse 
And 
That the old fashioned father of the woman he’s supposed to marry doesn’t 
Like 
Agree with a male nurse 
He thinks it should be a woman’s job 
So 

Even though it’s like a satire it still like keeps that sentiment alive 

No
