Melissa Carbone: ok you're first topic is the war in Iraq Apr 1, 2007 4:12:50 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: how does everyone feel about it? Apr 1, 2007 4:13:02 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: has it gone on long enough? Apr 1, 2007 4:13:09 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: gone on too long i must say Apr 1, 2007 4:13:14 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but there's nothing we can really do about that at this point Apr 1, 2007 4:13:23 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: Personally, I don't think we should have gone in in the first place, but being that we are there now, just pulling out all at once is going to do nothing but harm Apr 1, 2007 4:13:34 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i agree with that Apr 1, 2007 4:13:43 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: none of us here have a REALLY adequate idea of whats going on ober there Apr 1, 2007 4:13:53 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: because we havent been there... Apr 1, 2007 4:13:59 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: You know i've never thought about it that wat Apr 1, 2007 4:14:12 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: *wya Apr 1, 2007 4:14:13 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: **way Apr 1, 2007 4:14:16 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: but that makes a lot of sense Apr 1, 2007 4:14:20 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and by the time it filters through the newspapers and news shows, its in this "digested" form which just wants us to get angry about it Apr 1, 2007 4:14:28 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but we do know that we went in there with very little and very unreliable information and look where it's put us Apr 1, 2007 4:14:32 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: Also we as the public dont REALLY know all the information that the government had Apr 1, 2007 4:14:56 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i guess bc im not over there or experiencing its effects, i dont know what to think Apr 1, 2007 4:14:57 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i always felt that it was some part of the bush administrations imperialistic agenda Apr 1, 2007 4:14:59 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: after the cold war we stopped putting as much energy into "human assets" Apr 1, 2007 4:15:11 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: which was a big problem going in, we had nobody to really trust Apr 1, 2007 4:15:20 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i feel safer that the troops are over there and the fighting is not going on over here Apr 1, 2007 4:15:22 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: definitely Apr 1, 2007 4:15:27 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: a homeland war is a scary idea no? Apr 1, 2007 4:15:33 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: terrifying Apr 1, 2007 4:15:38 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but what are they doing over there at the current moment? more and more deaths and nothing is getting done Apr 1, 2007 4:15:45 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: they're stabalizing the government Apr 1, 2007 4:16:00 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: the place has been left more torn apart than it was before Apr 1, 2007 4:16:01 PM EDT
CMC blue322: have they actually stabilized the govt? Apr 1, 2007 4:16:12 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but seriously tho Apr 1, 2007 4:16:15 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: thats like trying to fit the circular block in the square hole Apr 1, 2007 4:16:16 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: they're working on it, rome wasn't built in a day Apr 1, 2007 4:16:26 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: do you guys think its easy to take three groups who HATE each other and make them agree? Apr 1, 2007 4:16:27 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: not at all Apr 1, 2007 4:16:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: theres no way that governments going to be stable Apr 1, 2007 4:16:39 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: try and take two friends who disagree on something, they still aren;t going to agree Apr 1, 2007 4:16:43 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: do you think the red sox and yankees would ever skip around the bases together singing happy love songs? Apr 1, 2007 4:16:50 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: I think there is, it's just going to take time Apr 1, 2007 4:16:51 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its like peas and ice cream Apr 1, 2007 4:16:55 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: it doesnt taste good Apr 1, 2007 4:16:58 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: what if the two friends HATE each other with a vengeance Apr 1, 2007 4:16:58 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and are willing to kill for it Apr 1, 2007 4:17:03 PM EDT
CMC blue322: soo basically they are never going to get along Apr 1, 2007 4:17:17 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i think its possible for there to be a peace Apr 1, 2007 4:17:24 PM EDT
CMC blue322: is that why people want the troops remvoed Apr 1, 2007 4:17:26 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: maybe not perfect Apr 1, 2007 4:17:28 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: well maybe not never but they havent for hundreds of years Apr 1, 2007 4:17:28 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: maybe not never, but its not as easy as our government seems to think Apr 1, 2007 4:17:32 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i feel that bush thinks that firepower is a safe answer to everything Apr 1, 2007 4:17:52 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: I dont think its fair to really just blame bush Apr 1, 2007 4:18:07 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: just because we have the most powerful army, doesnt mean we can get 2 sides to get along Apr 1, 2007 4:18:11 PM EDT
CMC blue322: what is bush doing Apr 1, 2007 4:18:14 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: not just bush, his administration Apr 1, 2007 4:18:18 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: the house and the senate had to agree to go over there as well Apr 1, 2007 4:18:19 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: superior firepower is an excellent last defense but it can't always solve political problems Apr 1, 2007 4:18:20 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its more or less cheyney Apr 1, 2007 4:18:22 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: except they didnt Apr 1, 2007 4:18:25 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: congress never declared war Apr 1, 2007 4:18:31 PM EDT
CMC blue322: so who did Apr 1, 2007 4:18:36 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: nobody Apr 1, 2007 4:18:38 PM EDT
CMC blue322: so were not at war? Apr 1, 2007 4:18:44 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: bush is the commander and chief Apr 1, 2007 4:18:46 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: nobody it was an "international action" enforced by a "coalition of the willing" Apr 1, 2007 4:18:49 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: he can send troops whereever he wants Apr 1, 2007 4:18:52 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: thats not true Apr 1, 2007 4:18:58 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: well not entirely Apr 1, 2007 4:19:06 PM EDT
CMC blue322: so why do we call it a war Apr 1, 2007 4:19:09 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: he has to clear it through the house and the senate Apr 1, 2007 4:19:10 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: to declare war Apr 1, 2007 4:19:22 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: we are indeed at war Apr 1, 2007 4:19:30 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i agree, but it was never officially "warified" Apr 1, 2007 4:19:46 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: THEY are at war and we are standing around trying to say WOAH EVERYBODY CALM THE HELL DOWN NOW Apr 1, 2007 4:19:49 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: so Apr 1, 2007 4:20:24 PM EDT
CMC blue322: so which of you believe we should be there? Apr 1, 2007 4:20:30 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its tough to say Apr 1, 2007 4:20:37 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i dont think we should have been there Apr 1, 2007 4:20:42 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but now we're in a little snafoo Apr 1, 2007 4:20:48 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: I think we shouldnt have gone in, at least not as soon as we did, but being there now, pulling out wouldn't work Apr 1, 2007 4:20:52 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: so its kinda tough to say Apr 1, 2007 4:20:54 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i DEFINITELY believe that saddam hussein's ba'ath party rule was not a good system of government... but now its gone, we have inherited some serious problems that beg the question whether or not intervention was justified Apr 1, 2007 4:21:19 PM EDT
CMC blue322: have we accomplished anything from being there? Apr 1, 2007 4:21:24 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i also think its not as black and white as "should we be there or not" Apr 1, 2007 4:21:27 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: yes we have blue, the removal of saddam and the emergence of deep seated conflict which we failed to wholly forsee Apr 1, 2007 4:21:49 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: at least the government under saddam was stable Apr 1, 2007 4:21:51 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: sure i dont agree with his actions Apr 1, 2007 4:21:55 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: by the sword it was stable Apr 1, 2007 4:22:01 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but there is more than one way that you can go about taking care of it Apr 1, 2007 4:22:12 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: it was stable by killing anyone who disagreed with him Apr 1, 2007 4:22:14 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: thats not a stable government Apr 1, 2007 4:22:17 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and those who didnt agree were pretty much any non-sunnis Apr 1, 2007 4:22:26 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: it was more stable than everybody killing everybody Apr 1, 2007 4:22:30 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: you are right, it was group A killing groups B and C Apr 1, 2007 4:22:39 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: now its one step above anarchy Apr 1, 2007 4:22:54 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: you put 3 groups who want to kill each other in an arena with no rules Apr 1, 2007 4:23:11 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: well now you've got a big problem Apr 1, 2007 4:23:20 PM EDT
CMC blue322: do they have any estimates of how many americans have died? Apr 1, 2007 4:23:21 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: 3,000+ Apr 1, 2007 4:23:27 PM EDT
CMC blue322: in how many years? Apr 1, 2007 4:23:38 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: 6 about Apr 1, 2007 4:23:47 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: or wait Apr 1, 2007 4:23:50 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: 3+ Apr 1, 2007 4:23:50 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: oh wait Apr 1, 2007 4:23:54 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: yeah Apr 1, 2007 4:23:55 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: my bad Apr 1, 2007 4:23:58 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and between 60,000 and 66,000 civilians killed, though DEFINITELY not all from our actions Apr 1, 2007 4:24:07 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: thats a pretty large number Apr 1, 2007 4:24:27 PM EDT
CMC blue322: thats a lot Apr 1, 2007 4:24:27 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and the DoD has confirmed over 3200 american deaths Apr 1, 2007 4:24:39 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: nothing compared to vietnam, but thats no reason to stay haha Apr 1, 2007 4:24:56 PM EDT
CMC blue322: how many people died when the towers were attacked Apr 1, 2007 4:25:01 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: it was somewhere that i heard that at the rate we are going there might not be an iraq in several some years Apr 1, 2007 4:25:06 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: heh Apr 1, 2007 4:25:18 PM EDT
CMC blue322: is that even possible Apr 1, 2007 4:25:25 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: the iraq war passed WTC in casualties last month Apr 1, 2007 4:25:32 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: once we leave, their new government could possibly fall Apr 1, 2007 4:25:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: then they would be vulnerable to countries like Iran Apr 1, 2007 4:25:41 PM EDT
CMC blue322: so were basically stuck? Apr 1, 2007 4:25:43 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: But the thing is , just pulling out and leaving,all at oncem is only going to make things worse Apr 1, 2007 4:25:48 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: possibly fall? is it even elevated to legitimacy now? Apr 1, 2007 4:25:50 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: and honestly Apr 1, 2007 4:25:54 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: no Apr 1, 2007 4:26:07 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but whatever we do set up Apr 1, 2007 4:26:12 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: do you really think they're going to only fight each other? its gonna spread Apr 1, 2007 4:26:21 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: who fight who? Apr 1, 2007 4:26:42 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: not us, i mean in the middle east Apr 1, 2007 4:26:56 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: they aren't just going to fight/ kill what have you each other Apr 1, 2007 4:27:09 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: well the middle east is large and complicated Apr 1, 2007 4:27:09 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: history of conflict Apr 1, 2007 4:27:23 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: theres a history of conflict between tons of countries Apr 1, 2007 4:27:40 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: not really an excuse for fighting Apr 1, 2007 4:27:52 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: HUNDREDS and HUNDREDS of years of history of conflict WITHIN iraq, between isreal and palestine, etc Apr 1, 2007 4:27:55 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: ok Apr 1, 2007 4:28:14 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: so what? Apr 1, 2007 4:28:16 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: as an american, if the canadian army killed my entire family in crossfire, i would be PISSED Apr 1, 2007 4:28:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: canadian army? Apr 1, 2007 4:28:52 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: OH SNAP Apr 1, 2007 4:28:55 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: So you think its justified to continue fighting and killing just for revenge? Apr 1, 2007 4:28:56 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i have friends at loyola who are from serbia who live here and love america and love the life they have in this country, but they HATED america when we attacked them Apr 1, 2007 4:28:59 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i dunno... do you guys kind of get what im saying? the sunnis and shiites and kurds arent just gonna get hammered one night and reach an agreement Apr 1, 2007 4:29:31 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i agree Apr 1, 2007 4:29:38 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: while on fox news and some other news channels you hear that many iraqi civilians love us, there are still a very good amount that hate us Apr 1, 2007 4:29:42 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: oh absolutly Apr 1, 2007 4:29:49 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: but thats anywhere Apr 1, 2007 4:29:52 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and will try to stop us from achieving our goal Apr 1, 2007 4:29:53 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: well the like us cuz we got rid of saddam Apr 1, 2007 4:29:55 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: america hasnt exactly endeared itself to the hearts of the world Apr 1, 2007 4:30:05 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but in a country that is so used to a dictator and has overbearing cultural "rules" they arent going to want the government that we are trying to put in place Apr 1, 2007 4:30:28 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and they like us because we are TRYING to rebuild their lives, but TONS of them don't have electricity yet, they still have to pass through pain in the ass checkpoints, and dont like us for that Apr 1, 2007 4:30:39 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: is our goal really to be liked though? Apr 1, 2007 4:30:56 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i wouldnt like us Apr 1, 2007 4:30:57 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i dont think it should be Apr 1, 2007 4:31:04 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i would guess most of their aggression is aimed toward each other rather than us, there are just groups who dislike/attack us Apr 1, 2007 4:31:09 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: if we want to get anything done we shouldnt turn ourselves into the enemy Apr 1, 2007 4:31:13 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i dont think we are Apr 1, 2007 4:31:20 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but many of them do Apr 1, 2007 4:31:25 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i feel like we are the enemy :( Apr 1, 2007 4:31:34 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: dont forget, it's THEIR country Apr 1, 2007 4:31:41 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i dont Apr 1, 2007 4:31:41 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: not ours Apr 1, 2007 4:31:43 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: at this point our best realistic goal is to find the BEST course of action which is realistically possible which will lead to the least amt. of suffering for us AND them Apr 1, 2007 4:31:54 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: they arent going to be so easily accepting of our actions Apr 1, 2007 4:31:54 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: especially since many of them were loyal to saddam Apr 1, 2007 4:32:03 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: absolutly GBD Apr 1, 2007 4:32:06 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: But what is that goal Apr 1, 2007 4:32:28 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: *route Apr 1, 2007 4:32:32 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: if i could do ANYTHING i would learn arabic, get a lot tanner, go to iraq, and make friends and just talk to them and see whats up Apr 1, 2007 4:32:38 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: dangerous Apr 1, 2007 4:33:02 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: there will never be a day where everyone agrees on a government, or a central religion etc Apr 1, 2007 4:33:21 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: its not feasible Apr 1, 2007 4:33:31 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: exactly Apr 1, 2007 4:33:41 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and when you try to force that day to come it only makes matters worse Apr 1, 2007 4:33:53 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: But there is a way to Comprimise Apr 1, 2007 4:33:56 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: there is a way to compromise Apr 1, 2007 4:34:08 PM EDT
CMC blue322: how? Apr 1, 2007 4:34:08 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: which isn't by going in there and tearing their home apart Apr 1, 2007 4:34:16 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but as newcomers to the region, how do we unravel 800+ years of bad blood adn find it Apr 1, 2007 4:34:21 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but we arent tearing their homes apart Apr 1, 2007 4:34:25 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: they're tearing their own homes apart Apr 1, 2007 4:34:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i didnt mean literal homes Apr 1, 2007 4:34:36 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: they were before we got there Apr 1, 2007 4:34:38 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i know Apr 1, 2007 4:34:39 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: their internal conflicts are tearing each others homes apart, and we have secondary/tertiary roles in them Apr 1, 2007 4:34:40 PM EDT
CMC blue322: how many troops are in iraq? Apr 1, 2007 4:34:59 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but our presense hasnt done much to help solve that Apr 1, 2007 4:34:59 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: an iraqi whose family was killed in the gas attacks will love us for hanging saddam Apr 1, 2007 4:35:03 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: errr not hanging but removing and bringing to quasijustice Apr 1, 2007 4:35:16 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but one who has to commute to baghdad for work every day and wait in a 3+hour checkpoint line will be frustrated Apr 1, 2007 4:35:37 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: frustration is one thing, hate is another Apr 1, 2007 4:35:58 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and MANY MORE, whose families have been killed by other iraqis, will just get pissed and feed into their downward spiral of a civil war Apr 1, 2007 4:35:59 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: thats where the hate will come in Apr 1, 2007 4:36:07 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i think at this point we have the BEST intentions in iraq (set up a govt, economic infrastructure, etc) but they just might not be entirely feasible considering the fact that we are BROKE AS SHIT Apr 1, 2007 4:36:36 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: thats not going to cause hate aimed at america though , its going to cause hate aimed at other iraqis Apr 1, 2007 4:36:52 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: not only that but we're going about it the wrong way Apr 1, 2007 4:36:53 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: we're trying to set up a pro-american democracy Apr 1, 2007 4:37:04 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: in a place that is so used to this dictatorship Apr 1, 2007 4:37:13 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and with your islamic fundimentalists Apr 1, 2007 4:37:20 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and all of that jazz, it's not going to play out very easily Apr 1, 2007 4:37:30 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: So are you saying we should give up on trying to find a way to change a corrupt system? Apr 1, 2007 4:37:50 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: just because its hard, and its gonna take time? Apr 1, 2007 4:38:01 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i dont think we should give up Apr 1, 2007 4:38:03 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: im not saying give up Apr 1, 2007 4:38:05 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: then what Apr 1, 2007 4:38:11 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: im saying that we're going about it the wrong way Apr 1, 2007 4:38:12 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: well than whats the right way Apr 1, 2007 4:38:18 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i couldnt tell you Apr 1, 2007 4:38:24 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i dont think there is a right way Apr 1, 2007 4:38:26 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: nobody knows Apr 1, 2007 4:38:27 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: then who are you to criticize the people who are trying Apr 1, 2007 4:38:39 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: because its obvious that it wont work Apr 1, 2007 4:38:50 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: discourse is often the best way to any decision Apr 1, 2007 4:38:55 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i said it before, they' Apr 1, 2007 4:38:57 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: re trying to fit the circular block in the square hole Apr 1, 2007 4:39:04 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i dont think so Apr 1, 2007 4:39:13 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i dont think anyone wants to live in a dictatorship Apr 1, 2007 4:39:24 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: thats one metaphor Apr 1, 2007 4:39:29 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: heres another one: Apr 1, 2007 4:39:31 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: where you cant make your own decisions Apr 1, 2007 4:39:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: nobody wants to Apr 1, 2007 4:39:33 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: if you fill a nalgene bottle with water, motor oil, and rocks, it will separate into layers Apr 1, 2007 4:39:50 PM EDT
CMC blue322: but if they dont know any different our ideas may be to radical for them Apr 1, 2007 4:39:52 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but still, that doesnt change the fact that there is way too much internal conflict for us to go about this the way we have been Apr 1, 2007 4:39:54 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and NO MATTER HO WHARD you shake it it will always separate into layers Apr 1, 2007 4:40:00 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: so you're saying because people are different they will never get along? Apr 1, 2007 4:40:17 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: not never Apr 1, 2007 4:40:24 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but it will take a while Apr 1, 2007 4:40:29 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: NO MATTER HOW HARD you try to smush all the iraqis into a coherent nation they will (At least on the forseeable future) ALWAYS want to separate, there is simply TOO MUCH bad blood Apr 1, 2007 4:40:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and it wont just take democracy and a bag of candy Apr 1, 2007 4:40:36 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: not because they are different, because they have 800+ years of violent hateful history Apr 1, 2007 4:40:44 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i think its hard for different people to get along Apr 1, 2007 4:40:46 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: its hard, but its not impossible, and at least now theres an attempt at change Apr 1, 2007 4:41:02 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: different people dont necessarily have to hate each other tho Apr 1, 2007 4:41:06 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: not just different people, but different people who want to kill each other Apr 1, 2007 4:41:06 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but its only making matters worse Apr 1, 2007 4:41:12 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: yes shoop Apr 1, 2007 4:41:14 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: not just "Hey we hated each other this long, lets keep going" Apr 1, 2007 4:41:14 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: we may have officially torn apart a country Apr 1, 2007 4:41:19 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but "hey you killed my mom you fucker, i will never forgive you OR your religious sect which hates mine" Apr 1, 2007 4:41:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: not intentially Apr 1, 2007 4:41:43 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: hatred is not as set in stone as people think Apr 1, 2007 4:41:55 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: it just takes one person to change it Apr 1, 2007 4:42:01 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: one person to think differently Apr 1, 2007 4:42:06 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: and now a lot of people are thinking differently Apr 1, 2007 4:42:12 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: as inspiring as that is, it wont work Apr 1, 2007 4:42:16 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: why not Apr 1, 2007 4:42:28 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: how do you think we can solve this issue? Apr 1, 2007 4:42:39 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: 800+ years of war Apr 1, 2007 4:42:42 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: well right now that one person has to compete with muqtada al-sadr etc etc etc Apr 1, 2007 4:42:50 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and one person is going to rise up and change it? Apr 1, 2007 4:42:51 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: people who try are killed Apr 1, 2007 4:42:58 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: because he is one person who is inspiring many more Apr 1, 2007 4:43:02 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: in a violent direction Apr 1, 2007 4:43:07 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: my point is that its not one person anymore Apr 1, 2007 4:43:07 PM EDT
CMC blue322: why are the leaders killed? Apr 1, 2007 4:43:10 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: or being hung Apr 1, 2007 4:43:13 PM EDT
CMC blue322: or the people that try to be leaders Apr 1, 2007 4:43:17 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its an army Apr 1, 2007 4:43:24 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: no Apr 1, 2007 4:43:32 PM EDT

CMC blue322: what do the people in iraq want axactly Apr 1, 2007 4:43:36 PM EDT

CMC LoCoLady: i dont know if anyones asked them Apr 1, 2007 4:43:43 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i havent really taken an active part in trying to understand the issues in iraq Apr 1, 2007 4:44:31 PM EDT
CMC blue322: so what is the main problem Apr 1, 2007 4:44:40 PM EDT
CMC blue322: that you guys are disucsisng now Apr 1, 2007 4:44:46 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: they probably just want to live in a place where they can have electricity and water and not worry that each day might be their last Apr 1, 2007 4:44:53 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: civil war is not allowing the government to be put in place Apr 1, 2007 4:44:55 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: im not sure we even agree on what we're discussing now Apr 1, 2007 4:44:56 PM EDT

CMC LoCoLady: absolutly Apr 1, 2007 4:45:36 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: its yellow journalism, and its been around for ages Apr 1, 2007 4:45:45 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: they do NOT aim to give us accurate/intellectually stimulating information about this Apr 1, 2007 4:45:49 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: even if not yellow journalism, it's MARKETABLE journalism Apr 1, 2007 4:46:02 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: so the only place we will ever be able to figure out whats going on are by TALKING to vets who have come back or reading REAL publications like foreign affairs magazine Apr 1, 2007 4:46:38 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its not even a matter of where you watch it Apr 1, 2007 4:46:51 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: absolutly it is Apr 1, 2007 4:47:03 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: the information that they are given is given in some sort of biased way Apr 1, 2007 4:47:04 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: and they spin it to bias it even more Apr 1, 2007 4:47:15 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its all about how they manipulate it though Apr 1, 2007 4:47:17 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: exactly Apr 1, 2007 4:47:20 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: for their demographic Apr 1, 2007 4:47:24 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: people who dont want to think about death and destruction on the other side of the world care more about britneys head than that nick kid from west chesters head that got cut off Apr 1, 2007 4:50:38 PM EDT
CMC blue322: stories* Apr 1, 2007 4:50:40 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: there are ISSUES going on that people need to be informed about Apr 1, 2007 4:50:48 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: need to be but wont be because they are too apathetic Apr 1, 2007 4:50:58 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: fun to read about but when people let it distract them from what is actually going on, their minds become vulnerable to manipulation and they will believe anything that Fox News or something like that says Apr 1, 2007 4:51:04 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: john locke totally called us out on that 200+ years ago by the way Apr 1, 2007 4:51:17 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: not saying that its always the case but it happens Apr 1, 2007 4:51:22 PM EDT
CMC blue322: what did he say Apr 1, 2007 4:51:26 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: he said that once we all had enough to be comfortable materially we would all become "individualistic" and stop caring Apr 1, 2007 4:51:45 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: he called it the bad side of "american individualism" Apr 1, 2007 4:51:51 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: and he was dead right Apr 1, 2007 4:51:54 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: the tendency to say "well i have my car and house and shit so WHO CARES ABOUT IRAQ or WHO CARES ABOUT VOTING" Apr 1, 2007 4:52:04 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and check it out he was right Apr 1, 2007 4:52:07 PM EDT

CMC ShoopDaWhoop: what is it? fat stupid and lazy Apr 1, 2007 4:52:22 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: someone described it something like that Apr 1, 2007 4:52:27 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but thats not static, something catastrophic could happen and it could change! Apr 1, 2007 4:52:32 PM EDT
CMC blue322: americans? Apr 1, 2007 4:52:34 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: eg 1929! Apr 1, 2007 4:52:39 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: well he was talking about americans Apr 1, 2007 4:52:48 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: something catastrophic did happen, 9/11 Apr 1, 2007 4:53:00 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and his predicitons were pretty eerily dead on Apr 1, 2007 4:53:01 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: and people were up in arms.... Apr 1, 2007 4:53:06 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but that made us temporarily care Apr 1, 2007 4:53:08 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: for about 6 months Apr 1, 2007 4:53:10 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: that made us care enough to go into afghanistan Apr 1, 2007 4:53:13 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: key word! Apr 1, 2007 4:53:23 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: AFGHANISTAN Apr 1, 2007 4:53:27 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and some people definitely MANIPULATED our 9/11 feelings to make us go into iraq too even tho the two were unrelated Apr 1, 2007 4:53:33 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: absolutly Apr 1, 2007 4:53:43 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: but we are there. Apr 1, 2007 4:53:47 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: notice how it took a couple weeks to find saddam who has pleanty of look alikes but we still havent found osama Apr 1, 2007 4:53:53 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: do you guys think we should just pull out and leave? Apr 1, 2007 4:54:02 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but do you know why we didnt find osama Apr 1, 2007 4:54:03 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: whys that Apr 1, 2007 4:54:12 PM EDT

CMC ShoopDaWhoop: we created him? Apr 1, 2007 4:54:22 PM EDT
CMC blue322: ?? Apr 1, 2007 4:54:31 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: because when we went into afghanistan we had no reliable human assets, so we paid a bunch of warlords to secure the borer on the side of the country which we weren't invading from, they then took our money and let saddam sneak out the other side Apr 1, 2007 4:54:35 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: err osama Apr 1, 2007 4:54:43 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: not saddam Apr 1, 2007 4:54:44 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: but he has, with all his WELL BUILT foxholes and shit Apr 1, 2007 4:55:08 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: which we will never be able to totally flush out because its a logistical nightmare Apr 1, 2007 4:55:21 PM EDT
CMC blue322: so do you think he is still alive> Apr 1, 2007 4:55:22 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i dont know and i dont care Apr 1, 2007 4:55:30 PM EDT

CMC blue322: why dont you care Apr 1, 2007 4:55:38 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: because even if he is he cant really do much now Apr 1, 2007 4:55:42 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i think going after osama isnt gonna do much Apr 1, 2007 4:55:47 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: because OSAMA is inconsequential, as soon as we get him, someone else will take his place Apr 1, 2007 4:55:56 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: exactly Apr 1, 2007 4:56:02 PM EDT
CMC blue322: that sucks Apr 1, 2007 4:56:05 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: we need to be trying to resolve the CONFLICT, not just resolving the MAN Apr 1, 2007 4:56:09 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: did killing saddam pacify iraq? Apr 1, 2007 4:56:18 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: will killing osama pacify the world? Apr 1, 2007 4:56:23 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: no and no Apr 1, 2007 4:56:27 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: xacto Apr 1, 2007 4:56:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but its the thought behind it Apr 1, 2007 4:56:40 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: we didnt go into iraq for osama Apr 1, 2007 4:58:02 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: we went into iraq becasue there were "weapons of mass destruction" Apr 1, 2007 4:58:18 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: BUT if it werent for 9/11 it would have been a hell of a lot harder to sell the american polis/congress on invading iraq Apr 1, 2007 4:58:25 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: osama was like a magical carpet for the bush administration to get the troops in iraq Apr 1, 2007 4:58:28 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i never heard that Apr 1, 2007 4:58:30 PM EDT

CMC ShoopDaWhoop: even a dictator that tyranical knows when to draw the line between having his whole country destroyed and not Apr 1, 2007 5:00:37 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: we were already having most of these issues and would have them anyway Apr 1, 2007 5:00:41 PM EDT

CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i know, just trying to be general Apr 1, 2007 5:02:31 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: perhaps i should have worded it that way instead Apr 1, 2007 5:02:39 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: its a big bag of "hey we can play this game too, so give us legitimacy and stop treating us in a condescending manner you behemoth of an america" Apr 1, 2007 5:02:43 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: yeah but generalization is not a good way to explain things it just muddies the waters Apr 1, 2007 5:03:00 PM EDT
