CMC LoCoLady: ?so whats topic? Apr 24, 2007 9:06:26 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: we are talking about gay marriage now right Apr 24, 2007 9:06:32 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: This is one that really sticks in my craw Apr 24, 2007 9:06:37 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: ok guys your final topic is gay marriage... several states are looking to legalize it, do you think either side is right or wrong? Apr 24, 2007 9:06:37 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: both are wrong Apr 24, 2007 9:06:47 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and you alone are right =P Apr 24, 2007 9:06:54 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: Yes, I think its absolutly wrong to not allow people the right of marriage Apr 24, 2007 9:06:58 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its not up to the state in the first place Apr 24, 2007 9:06:59 PM EDT
CMC blue322: how are both wrong? Apr 24, 2007 9:07:02 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: and i dont mean religiously Apr 24, 2007 9:07:02 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i mean civil union Apr 24, 2007 9:07:06 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i agree with civil unions, but i think that should be require no matter what kind of couple you are, homosexual or heterosexual Apr 24, 2007 9:07:30 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: marriage is a sacrament Apr 24, 2007 9:07:41 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: it is performed in the church that you are a member of and should be a part of that Apr 24, 2007 9:07:51 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: wait, required Apr 24, 2007 9:07:57 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: civil union isnt required Apr 24, 2007 9:08:02 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i think it should be ALLOWEd to everyone Apr 24, 2007 9:08:12 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: once married in whichever church you should be allowed to apply for a civil union which will grant you the benefits Apr 24, 2007 9:08:13 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: so they can cosign mortgages, visit each other in the hospital, and uncontestably write each other into wills, civil union would be a fair thing to look at Apr 24, 2007 9:08:13 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: if they made a non-religious civil union and opened it up to heterosexual couples, id bet a SHITLOAD of people would do it Apr 24, 2007 9:08:40 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: there is a non religious civil union now Apr 24, 2007 9:08:53 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: because they wouldnt have to go through pre-marriage catholic counseling and shtuff Apr 24, 2007 9:09:00 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: it wouldnt change anything with the current state of marriage, you could still use husband or wife or whatever, but there would be a little more paperwork Apr 24, 2007 9:09:00 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: hello? Apr 24, 2007 9:09:10 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: there is? dont most people still get married in a religious ceremony tho? Apr 24, 2007 9:09:15 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: you dont have to get married religiously Apr 24, 2007 9:09:18 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: you'd be surprised at the amount that don't Apr 24, 2007 9:09:25 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: word Apr 24, 2007 9:09:27 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: no you dont, but still thats a whole different thing Apr 24, 2007 9:09:30 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: marriage is a term used in church Apr 24, 2007 9:09:35 PM EDT

CMC blue322: my grandma wouldnt go to her wedding bc it wasnt in a church Apr 24, 2007 9:09:56 PM EDT

CMC ShoopDaWhoop: for a non-religious wedding Apr 24, 2007 9:10:20 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: or so to speak Apr 24, 2007 9:10:24 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: why Apr 24, 2007 9:10:28 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i dont know, i tend to associate "married" with religion Apr 24, 2007 9:10:41 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: They should be able to say they're married if they want, they are Apr 24, 2007 9:10:42 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: I don't Apr 24, 2007 9:10:45 PM EDT

CMC LoCoLady: so what Apr 24, 2007 9:11:32 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: the title marriage though is closely associated with the church Apr 24, 2007 9:11:46 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: Why should someone who sees it as marriage not be allowed to say they are married Apr 24, 2007 9:11:48 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: not by everyone Apr 24, 2007 9:11:53 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: im not saying they shouldnt be able to say they are, im saying the state shouldnt Apr 24, 2007 9:12:05 PM EDT
CMC blue322: what is required to be married Apr 24, 2007 9:12:09 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: the state is not a church Apr 24, 2007 9:12:11 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: the state cannot perform sacraments Apr 24, 2007 9:12:16 PM EDT
CMC blue322: paperwork from the state? Apr 24, 2007 9:12:20 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: Marriage is not a sacrament Apr 24, 2007 9:12:23 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its too close to a religious title Apr 24, 2007 9:12:26 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: Its viewed as such in SOME churches, and some religions Apr 24, 2007 9:12:34 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: thats like calling a representative a priest or something Apr 24, 2007 9:12:37 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: not in all Apr 24, 2007 9:12:39 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: no its not Apr 24, 2007 9:12:41 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i feel that it is Apr 24, 2007 9:12:55 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: okay this is too off topic at the moment Apr 24, 2007 9:13:10 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: definition of marriage : the social institution under which a man and woman establish their decision to live as husband and wife by legal commitments Apr 24, 2007 9:13:15 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: were discussing the title of marriage as opposed to gay marriage Apr 24, 2007 9:13:25 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: that is the more liberal definition of it yes Apr 24, 2007 9:13:54 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: no Apr 24, 2007 9:14:01 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: thats the dictionary definition Apr 24, 2007 9:14:09 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: its ridiculous to tell someone they cant be married/ have a union just because of the sex of their partner Apr 24, 2007 9:14:20 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i agree Apr 24, 2007 9:14:30 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i never said they shouldnt be allowed to Apr 24, 2007 9:14:55 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i just feel that decision is up to the church, for the religious unions Apr 24, 2007 9:15:05 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: civil unions are a great alternative Apr 24, 2007 9:15:12 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: its not an alternative Apr 24, 2007 9:15:19 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: civil union is marriage Apr 24, 2007 9:15:23 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: to getting married in a church? Apr 24, 2007 9:15:26 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: yes it is an alternative Apr 24, 2007 9:15:30 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: im just saying its still a marriage Apr 24, 2007 9:15:36 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: if the church doesnt allow it there isnt much other choice Apr 24, 2007 9:15:36 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: just not a religious marriage Apr 24, 2007 9:15:42 PM EDT
CMC blue322: so you want a religious marriage for same sex partners Apr 24, 2007 9:15:58 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: okay, you win now get on topic instead of consistantly arguing your point which i will refuse to agree with Apr 24, 2007 9:15:59 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: no im not saying they need a religious marriage, but they deserve the right of marriage under the law Apr 24, 2007 9:16:23 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: giving them the rights of a husband/wife Apr 24, 2007 9:16:32 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: such as pension, next of kin etc Apr 24, 2007 9:16:41 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: well... husband/husband Apr 24, 2007 9:16:44 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: health benefits Apr 24, 2007 9:16:45 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i do think that they should get all the same things that they would in a church, but as for the churches it is up to them to allow it or not Apr 24, 2007 9:17:05 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: or wife/wife or still husband/wife because you could just say that husband is normally the breadwinner and wife is the one who stays home Apr 24, 2007 9:17:12 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i never said they should get married in a church, i agree let the church ban it Apr 24, 2007 9:17:26 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: alright Apr 24, 2007 9:17:31 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: Legal has NOTHING to do with the church Apr 24, 2007 9:17:34 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: then we both agree Apr 24, 2007 9:17:34 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: yes Apr 24, 2007 9:17:44 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but the way that our government has tried to enforce bans has been affecting the church Apr 24, 2007 9:17:51 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: how do you mean Apr 24, 2007 9:17:58 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and if they banned it altogether it would impact the churches right of free exersise Apr 24, 2007 9:18:03 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: church is still working under our laws Apr 24, 2007 9:18:20 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: if you ban gay marriage then you wouldnt be allowed to get married inside of a church either Apr 24, 2007 9:18:23 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: ? Apr 24, 2007 9:18:32 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: exactly, but i dont feel that its up to the government to make that one decision for them Apr 24, 2007 9:18:36 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: unfortunatly the law is the law Apr 24, 2007 9:18:51 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i can understand somnething that would be determental such as a church that practices killing people Apr 24, 2007 9:18:55 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: but i dont understand why the church comes into this at all Apr 24, 2007 9:19:02 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: it has nothing to do with the church Apr 24, 2007 9:19:08 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: maybe for your case Apr 24, 2007 9:19:21 PM EDT
CMC blue322: if they are performing the act then they areinvolned? Apr 24, 2007 9:19:24 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but in many cases people do get married in a church Apr 24, 2007 9:19:27 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: if a gay couple wants to get married, and the law allows it (which it should) Apr 24, 2007 9:19:27 PM EDT
CMC blue322: but arent church and state separate? Apr 24, 2007 9:19:47 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: well Church has a christian connotation and at this point in time Catholics at least condemn gay marriage Apr 24, 2007 9:19:51 PM EDT
CMC blue322: so cant they do what they want Apr 24, 2007 9:19:52 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: church and state are seperate Apr 24, 2007 9:19:58 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: but they still have to follow laws Apr 24, 2007 9:20:05 PM EDT
CMC blue322: so then its up to the state to allow gay marriage Apr 24, 2007 9:20:38 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: church and state are separate? Apr 24, 2007 9:20:49 PM EDT

CMC LoCoLady: thye should be Apr 24, 2007 9:21:08 PM EDT
CMC blue322: are they separate or not Apr 24, 2007 9:21:26 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: religion and country require the same types of allegience, and religious/moral convictions ALWAYS express themselves politically in any liberal state, especially democracy Apr 24, 2007 9:21:32 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: technically yes Apr 24, 2007 9:21:34 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: do you go to the post office on christmas and say WHY THE HELL ARE YOU CLOSED? Apr 24, 2007 9:21:47 PM EDT

CMC LoCoLady: which i think is crazy Apr 24, 2007 9:24:08 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: they chose him, and he owes his moral allegience to them, hence his wacky "marriage amendment" Apr 24, 2007 9:24:15 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: hence the push for the amendment banning gay marriage because of his catholic beliefs Apr 24, 2007 9:24:16 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: e.g. the quran vs. the bible vs. the torah Apr 24, 2007 9:38:34 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: or even the king james bible vs. the other one Apr 24, 2007 9:38:51 PM EDT
