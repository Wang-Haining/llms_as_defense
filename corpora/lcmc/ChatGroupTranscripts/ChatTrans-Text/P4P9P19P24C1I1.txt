Melissa Carbone: OK everyone, your first topic is the war in iraq Mar 18, 2007 2:04:36 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: Does anyone have any thoughts on that? Mar 18, 2007 2:04:47 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I do Mar 18, 2007 2:04:54 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: go for it Mar 18, 2007 2:05:05 PM EDT
[Roberta Sabin joined the session] Mar 18, 2007 2:05:41 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: My personal belief is that it has gone on far too long. The war itself no longer has a focus or a clear and distinct aim. We were trying to give democracy to a nation that previously had not experienced it, but that goal seems to have long since parished. Mar 18, 2007 2:05:52 PM EDT
Roberta Sabin: Don't mind me--just checking in---and out! Mar 18, 2007 2:06:05 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: so articulate Mar 18, 2007 2:06:13 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: it has gone on too long Mar 18, 2007 2:06:25 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: it's been 4 years Mar 18, 2007 2:06:29 PM EDT
[Roberta Sabin left the session] Mar 18, 2007 2:06:30 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i agree with you thought, it's completely pointless now Mar 18, 2007 2:06:31 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and the President just announce in January that he plans to send 21, 500 more troops to Iraq Mar 18, 2007 2:06:49 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: My other thought dealing with the length is the drain it has had on the domestic economy and overall morale Mar 18, 2007 2:07:03 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: while i do think it has gone on too long, i don't think its fair to look in the past to justify our opinions now Mar 18, 2007 2:07:09 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: hindsight is 20/20 Mar 18, 2007 2:07:16 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Well with that hindisight Bush should correct his actions and not send more troops Mar 18, 2007 2:07:35 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so, you think in 2003, it was a good idea to invade Iraq? Mar 18, 2007 2:07:36 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: what do you mean? Mar 18, 2007 2:07:36 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: the U.S. governmentt is not some evil organization Mar 18, 2007 2:07:43 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but it does make a lot of mistakes Mar 18, 2007 2:07:56 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and I think that Iraq is one of them Mar 18, 2007 2:08:07 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: true Mar 18, 2007 2:08:08 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: In all fairness, we all make mistakes...their's are far more visible Mar 18, 2007 2:08:12 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: but i'm sure they'd be able to do a better job than you or me Mar 18, 2007 2:08:23 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I just believe they should be able to spot their mistake and correct it now Mar 18, 2007 2:08:26 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: not make it worse Mar 18, 2007 2:08:29 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i don't think the war started out pointless, like we did accomplish gettin rid of sadaam, but there isn't anything good coming out of it now and it's just being dragged out Mar 18, 2007 2:09:05 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Exactly, it does not seem, domestically anyway, that there is still a strong drive for democracy Mar 18, 2007 2:09:36 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I think there was faulty rationale for the war to begin with Mar 18, 2007 2:09:38 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: wasn't one of the main reasons for war the claim that Saddam was hiding weapons of mass destruction? Mar 18, 2007 2:10:00 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: we thought he was Mar 18, 2007 2:10:11 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and did we ever find any? no Mar 18, 2007 2:10:11 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: To some extent I agree with that, but the US should be a force that other countries can come to for aide Mar 18, 2007 2:10:16 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but who do we know for sure has them?North Korea Mar 18, 2007 2:10:24 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but have we invaded them? Mar 18, 2007 2:10:29 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: no Mar 18, 2007 2:10:30 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: you cant compare apples to oranges Mar 18, 2007 2:10:49 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: who was seeking our aide? Mar 18, 2007 2:11:00 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well the US has a thing for going after countries they see as a direct threat even if there isn't any real valid reasoning Mar 18, 2007 2:11:08 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Silently, the people of Iraq Mar 18, 2007 2:11:22 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: they were clearly sufferring under their current rule Mar 18, 2007 2:11:30 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: the US has a thing for going in unprepared and following a policy of escalation Mar 18, 2007 2:11:41 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah but now that that ruler is gone, they don't want us there anymore Mar 18, 2007 2:11:53 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: there are people suffering everywhere Mar 18, 2007 2:11:54 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: how can you pick and choose which people to save? Mar 18, 2007 2:12:05 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: True, and we cannot help everyone on the planet at once Mar 18, 2007 2:12:07 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: You do not have to pick, do what you can with your limited resources Mar 18, 2007 2:12:21 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i know do we invade every country that has people suffering bc of their gov't Mar 18, 2007 2:12:24 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: we dont have the resources Mar 18, 2007 2:12:46 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: you don't think it's possible that there were alterior motives? Mar 18, 2007 2:12:47 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Not every person in the world is sufferring because their government is a tyrrany, but rather because it is underdeveloped Mar 18, 2007 2:12:48 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: oil? Mar 18, 2007 2:12:52 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: We would not invade an underdeveloped country because it is underdeveloped Mar 18, 2007 2:13:10 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: agreed Mar 18, 2007 2:13:21 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: so then why invade every country where people are sufferring, that's an irrational generalization Mar 18, 2007 2:13:44 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: and again, we dont have teh resources Mar 18, 2007 2:14:04 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well obviously the US didn't invade Iraq for either of those reasons Mar 18, 2007 2:14:16 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: can you expland mtnbike? Mar 18, 2007 2:14:18 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: we didn't have the resources for this war Mar 18, 2007 2:14:32 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: we only have so many troops Mar 18, 2007 2:14:33 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: By the very nature of us being enclosed on planet Earth, we will never have an infinite amount of resources Mar 18, 2007 2:15:07 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: so obviously we cant have a military presence everywhere Mar 18, 2007 2:15:09 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: Bush didn't send nearly enough troops to begin with, he didn't plan effectively for the power vaccuum that erupted once the leader of Iraq was deposed Mar 18, 2007 2:15:11 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: hindsight is 20/20 Mar 18, 2007 2:15:32 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: what do you mean by power vaccuum? Mar 18, 2007 2:15:54 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: all the looting and general chaos that took place once the US removed Saddam from power Mar 18, 2007 2:16:32 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: ohh gotcha Mar 18, 2007 2:16:46 PM EDT
[Roberta Sabin joined the session] Mar 18, 2007 2:16:52 PM EDT
Roberta Sabin: Hope evrything is going OK Mar 18, 2007 2:17:17 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: great Mar 18, 2007 2:17:21 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Certainly Mar 18, 2007 2:17:26 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: mtnbike, can you explain what you mean by hindsight is 20/20 Mar 18, 2007 2:17:56 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: well..you can always look back and see how something should have been done, but at the time, you don't know how something will turn out Mar 18, 2007 2:18:51 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: you think some knowledge of history would help, Vietnam perhaps Mar 18, 2007 2:19:15 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: you think we would learn from our previous mistakes Mar 18, 2007 2:19:31 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: for example, what if the us had not taken military action, and saddam launched missiles at israel? Mar 18, 2007 2:19:44 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well when the war started i'm sure most didn't see it as a mistake Mar 18, 2007 2:20:00 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: then we'd be saying bush was irresponsible for not taking action Mar 18, 2007 2:20:04 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so you approve of pre-emptive strikes Mar 18, 2007 2:20:07 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i approve of teh decision makers making informed decisions Mar 18, 2007 2:20:34 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: There's a difference between learning from your previous mistakes and failiing to take future actions. We cannot let past failures with good intent stop us from trying for future good intentions merely because we failed...think about it, if you failed a test in a class, would you just say you learned from failing that and not take the next one - no, you would try harder and strive for that same intention Mar 18, 2007 2:20:35 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but did they actually make an informed decision? Mar 18, 2007 2:21:29 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: of course they did, that is their job Mar 18, 2007 2:21:47 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: they lied about having proof of weapons of mass destruction Mar 18, 2007 2:22:12 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: should they call you in for strategical decisions? Mar 18, 2007 2:22:18 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: who, me? Mar 18, 2007 2:22:30 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: yup Mar 18, 2007 2:22:38 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what do you mean? Mar 18, 2007 2:22:42 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: you do what you can with the intelligence you have Mar 18, 2007 2:22:55 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i don't think it was so much of a lie as it was something the perceived to be true Mar 18, 2007 2:23:01 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: exactly Mar 18, 2007 2:23:14 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Even if in hindsight it turned out their were no weapons...is that a risk we could take, to assume there were no weapons even if we had the smallest of inclinations that they did Mar 18, 2007 2:23:35 PM EDT
Roberta Sabin: I just wonder if people's opinions would change if there was a draft--like in Vietnam? You, your parents, Congress people whose children may have to go? (The I'll sign out--to grade papers!) Mar 18, 2007 2:23:48 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Alright, we messed up, but what if it went the other way and they had the weapons and we did not search - what then? Mar 18, 2007 2:23:54 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: well, we're taking that risk with North Korea Mar 18, 2007 2:23:55 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: a country that we actually know has nuclear weapons Mar 18, 2007 2:24:05 PM EDT
[Roberta Sabin left the session] Mar 18, 2007 2:24:09 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and has threatened to use them Mar 18, 2007 2:24:14 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: We have taken action against North Korea in a political manner as opposed to war Mar 18, 2007 2:24:37 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: International politics is a complex business Mar 18, 2007 2:24:41 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Maybe some sort of physical threat is yet to come Mar 18, 2007 2:24:48 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so then why not political action with Iraq? Mar 18, 2007 2:24:57 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: don't you think it may have had something to do with the political rhetoric of 9/11? Mar 18, 2007 2:25:15 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: cause iraq didnt have a nuclear program Mar 18, 2007 2:25:18 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: You seem to forget the years before the war, both Bushes and Clinton....there have been political actions Mar 18, 2007 2:25:19 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i wonder if women would be part of a new draft Mar 18, 2007 2:25:43 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: to comment on Dr. Sabin's point Mar 18, 2007 2:25:50 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i think having a draft in general would just be ridiculous Mar 18, 2007 2:26:13 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: if they did draft women, they wouldn't be deployed to combat operations Mar 18, 2007 2:26:23 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: can u expand on that janada Mar 18, 2007 2:26:28 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: It would be, agreed. It would encompass many uninterested and unmotivated fighters Mar 18, 2007 2:26:34 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well it would just be prolonging a war that well above the majority of the country doesn't support anyways Mar 18, 2007 2:27:10 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: do you feel that a draft is ever acceptable? Mar 18, 2007 2:27:36 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I do not feel that Mar 18, 2007 2:27:51 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: mmm not really Mar 18, 2007 2:27:55 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: sure, if the us is fighting for existence as a nation Mar 18, 2007 2:27:58 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: in a defensive position Mar 18, 2007 2:28:11 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what do mean, "existence as a nation"? Mar 18, 2007 2:28:13 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: oh okay Mar 18, 2007 2:28:15 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i mean on one hand, if we're in a war that actually needs to be fought and there aren't enough troops it seems necessary but it also doesn't seem fair to ask someone to sacrifce their life for a cause they may not even believe in Mar 18, 2007 2:28:48 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but can anyone really know when a war needs to be fought Mar 18, 2007 2:29:15 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well i mean i think WW2 we had a direct reason to fight Mar 18, 2007 2:29:51 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: this, not so much Mar 18, 2007 2:29:54 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Reasons to fight can differ from person to person Mar 18, 2007 2:30:03 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well at least not anymore Mar 18, 2007 2:30:03 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i see, so in defense of the country Mar 18, 2007 2:30:06 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah exactly Mar 18, 2007 2:30:14 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I know there is no way I would be motivated to fight in a draft - there are too many other thing important to me to do that with my life. Mar 18, 2007 2:30:39 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: same here Mar 18, 2007 2:30:58 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: in think in this day and age, a draft is unlikely because of the nature of the enemy Mar 18, 2007 2:31:25 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: which is not a cohesive force Mar 18, 2007 2:31:37 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: in terms of industrial capabilities etc Mar 18, 2007 2:31:56 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Agreed Mar 18, 2007 2:31:58 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: what do you mean by cohesive force? Mar 18, 2007 2:32:12 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: terrorist organizations do not have a nation of their own Mar 18, 2007 2:32:48 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: and they dont really have a military per se Mar 18, 2007 2:32:59 PM EDT
[CMC Rocket_ship21 left the session] Mar 18, 2007 2:33:14 PM EDT
[CMC Rocket_ship21 joined the session] Mar 18, 2007 2:33:20 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so, was Bush fighting terrorists by invading Iraq? Mar 18, 2007 2:33:20 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Sorry about that Mar 18, 2007 2:33:32 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: thats ok Mar 18, 2007 2:33:38 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: yes - and saddam Mar 18, 2007 2:33:56 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: the terrorist behind 9/11? Mar 18, 2007 2:34:25 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: but can you really fight terrorism by invading only one country it's happening in? Mar 18, 2007 2:34:34 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: terrorists, i meant to say Mar 18, 2007 2:34:35 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: All terrorist groups Mar 18, 2007 2:34:38 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: it's a fight against terrorism Mar 18, 2007 2:34:44 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: right on Mar 18, 2007 2:34:54 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: The ideal thereof Mar 18, 2007 2:35:04 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and what terrorist group was in Iraq? Mar 18, 2007 2:35:07 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I think you may be mixing separate fights Mar 18, 2007 2:35:20 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what do you mean? Mar 18, 2007 2:35:34 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: The independence of Iraq and then terrorist groups Mar 18, 2007 2:35:40 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: well, mtnbike said the war against Iraq was part of the war on terrorism, if I understood him/her correctly Mar 18, 2007 2:36:06 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: the idea of fighting terrorism kind of seems implausible to me because it happens in so many places Mar 18, 2007 2:36:11 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so i'm trying to figure out what terrorists they were Mar 18, 2007 2:36:44 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and if the US found them Mar 18, 2007 2:36:53 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: true enough, but terrorism can exist beyond the boundaries of Iraq as well Mar 18, 2007 2:36:57 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: but we have to resist them Mar 18, 2007 2:37:16 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I happen to have CNN as my homepage, and maybe once a month I see on the front page that they have caught some new member of Al Queda Mar 18, 2007 2:37:21 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: them? Mar 18, 2007 2:37:24 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: and it's not like Iraq is the only country with a personal vendetta against Americans Mar 18, 2007 2:37:25 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: the terrorist organizations Mar 18, 2007 2:37:36 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Or killed Mar 18, 2007 2:37:38 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: right, but my question is this, is the war in Iraq a fight against terrorist organizations, because that is what it seems to me that you are saying Mar 18, 2007 2:38:10 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well unless they find Osama, i don't think finding or killing one member here or there is really that effective Mar 18, 2007 2:38:34 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Not directly, it would seem Mar 18, 2007 2:38:40 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: why not? Mar 18, 2007 2:38:42 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: really Mar 18, 2007 2:38:45 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: ? Mar 18, 2007 2:38:47 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: There is only one leader in the organization Mar 18, 2007 2:38:54 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well he's kind of like the mastermind behind all the madness isn't he? Mar 18, 2007 2:39:05 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: So if at Loyola all the teachers left, but the President was still here, just as effective? Mar 18, 2007 2:39:11 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: you can always find more teachers Mar 18, 2007 2:39:25 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: not effective ones Mar 18, 2007 2:39:34 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: my argument is that the war in Iraq was not fighting terrorism Mar 18, 2007 2:39:41 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: leadership is not a quality that all people possess Mar 18, 2007 2:39:48 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: then what was it fighting? Mar 18, 2007 2:40:19 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: besides, the US can't fight terrorism on its own Mar 18, 2007 2:40:29 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Obviously Mar 18, 2007 2:40:35 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and by invading Iraq it just alienated countries that used to be our strong alliee Mar 18, 2007 2:40:49 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Are cries for the fight have been worldwide Mar 18, 2007 2:40:50 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: allies i meant to say Mar 18, 2007 2:40:55 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: how do you know they won't be effective? they'll still get the job done won't they? and it's not like a member of a terrorist group needs to be intellectual, they just have to carry out their duties, a lot of which end indeath for them anyways Mar 18, 2007 2:41:02 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: You and I both know the difference between a teacher and an effecitve teacher Mar 18, 2007 2:41:19 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: Bush said we went to war in Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein, to free the Iraqi people, it was called Operation Iraqi freedom Mar 18, 2007 2:41:41 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yes Mar 18, 2007 2:41:51 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: and that battle lives on Mar 18, 2007 2:41:54 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: there can be more than a few objectives Mar 18, 2007 2:41:59 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yes, but you don't have to be effective in that way to make a good terrorist, you just have to know how to follor orders Mar 18, 2007 2:42:08 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: There are still insurgeons fighting against the cause in Iraq - supporters of Hussein Mar 18, 2007 2:42:18 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well they're free, and they don't want our goverment so why stay there? Mar 18, 2007 2:42:32 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: so no one needs to plan the logistics of an attack? Mar 18, 2007 2:42:34 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: The hierarchy has students, teachers, and the president - without good teachers, the new students will suffer, or perhaps there will be a diminishing return on new students because of a lack of teachers Mar 18, 2007 2:43:06 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: They are not free Mar 18, 2007 2:43:23 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: that is incorrect, there is still very much danger over in the territory Mar 18, 2007 2:43:35 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well that's true, and maybe we are helping to protect them from that danger, but at the same time, it does seem like they don't want our help Mar 18, 2007 2:44:43 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Where do you get that idea? Mar 18, 2007 2:45:13 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: indeed, not everyone wants to be like the US, even though Americans seem to think that Mar 18, 2007 2:45:14 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: so then should we pull out altogether? Mar 18, 2007 2:45:29 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: phase out the troops Mar 18, 2007 2:45:44 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: wont that be a victory in the eyes of terrorists? Mar 18, 2007 2:45:46 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Did you not see the Iraqis all over the world celebrating the day they got their freedom rom tyrannical rule Mar 18, 2007 2:45:49 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: maybe not altogether, but sending more troops isn't solving anything either Mar 18, 2007 2:46:01 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: how can what has happened so far be deemed a victory for us? Mar 18, 2007 2:46:10 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: You see victory in a very clear cut way - for instance crossing a finish line in a marathon, but what if that marathon is to raise money for aids, was there not some small victory in the race itself, the attempt thereof Mar 18, 2007 2:46:47 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: this issue is not as simple as people make it out to be Mar 18, 2007 2:47:22 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: concerning the state of Iraq today, the US soldiers who have fought there, what is victorious about it? Mar 18, 2007 2:47:42 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: agreed, there are too many consequences no matter what we do Mar 18, 2007 2:47:53 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Do no misconstrue my point, I believe the war should be ended. But I am saying we have done great deeds thuis far. Mar 18, 2007 2:48:34 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i agree Mar 18, 2007 2:48:42 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: which are? Mar 18, 2007 2:48:44 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: removing saddam Mar 18, 2007 2:48:54 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Ended tyrrany Mar 18, 2007 2:48:59 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: sent a message on terrorism Mar 18, 2007 2:49:03 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah but for every good thing we hear, how many bad things do we hear about? Mar 18, 2007 2:49:25 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yet insurgency and terorrism still plagues Iraq Mar 18, 2007 2:49:53 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: every day, the news reports car bomings and suicide bombers Mar 18, 2007 2:50:10 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: There is no magic that can end it in a matter of 4 years Mar 18, 2007 2:50:17 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: you are oversimplifying this Mar 18, 2007 2:50:22 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i just think we should allow the joint chiefs - who have all the intelligence info - to make the decisions Mar 18, 2007 2:50:44 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yet the government was not prepared for it to last even this past 4 years Mar 18, 2007 2:50:53 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: so should we let ordinary folk make decisions Mar 18, 2007 2:51:19 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: ? Mar 18, 2007 2:51:21 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: how many stories have you heard of weapons shortages Mar 18, 2007 2:51:22 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: What does that have to do with? Mar 18, 2007 2:51:37 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: What is your point? Mar 18, 2007 2:51:40 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: mtnbike said that no one should this war could end in just 4 years, if i have that right Mar 18, 2007 2:52:27 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and I agree with him Mar 18, 2007 2:52:32 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: probably that the US underestimated the gravity of the situation and now we are caught up in a war that's taking much longer than anyone thought it would Mar 18, 2007 2:52:33 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what i'm saying, is that the goverment knowing this, did not adequately prepare for a war of that length Mar 18, 2007 2:52:51 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: which can be seen in the weapons shortages Mar 18, 2007 2:53:05 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Things change, things happen...we cannot predict the future Mar 18, 2007 2:53:10 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: in the strains that have been put on army medical facilities Mar 18, 2007 2:53:15 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: So because we are not properly perpared, we should stop the fight? Mar 18, 2007 2:53:22 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: We are not prepared to fight AIDS, should we stop that fight as well Mar 18, 2007 2:53:34 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: you say you don't support the war, but really it sounds like you do Mar 18, 2007 2:53:41 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i'm saying that U.S. should be more prepared next time it decides to invade a country Mar 18, 2007 2:53:43 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I do not support it, I support the motives Mar 18, 2007 2:53:54 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: ok, but how do you suggest we prepare ourselves? Mar 18, 2007 2:54:06 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: there is clearly a more efficient way to accomplish them, however Mar 18, 2007 2:54:08 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: how can you support the motives and not the war? Mar 18, 2007 2:54:17 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: you can say you dont support the way we've gone about the attack Mar 18, 2007 2:54:30 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Most certainly can...I can support the idea of baseball, but not like a particular player Mar 18, 2007 2:54:38 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: so you're saying that there are ways to solve the problem without going to war? Mar 18, 2007 2:54:59 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Definitely Mar 18, 2007 2:55:08 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: how? Mar 18, 2007 2:55:11 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: cutting off resources, getting many more countries to join in this effort Mar 18, 2007 2:55:24 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yes, the U.S. went directly against the will of the UN Mar 18, 2007 2:55:39 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: And maybe war is still the answer for some of it Mar 18, 2007 2:55:40 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: that was not smart Mar 18, 2007 2:55:43 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: just saying what is there now, is not working Mar 18, 2007 2:55:48 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: but in doing this wouldn't the Iraqi people we are trying to save still suffer? Mar 18, 2007 2:55:55 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: the UN doesnt really take action Mar 18, 2007 2:56:06 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: it just kinda waves its finger at things Mar 18, 2007 2:56:20 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: and i think that it is impossible to cut off whatever resources are aiding the terrorist because obviously those countries aren't on our side Mar 18, 2007 2:56:27 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so the UN doesn't matter? Mar 18, 2007 2:56:44 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: in short, no they dont Mar 18, 2007 2:57:06 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so it should be dissolved? Mar 18, 2007 2:57:21 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: can you expand mtnbike? Mar 18, 2007 2:57:35 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Certainly the UN can be extremely powerful, but they have no force to stop a country from terrorism Mar 18, 2007 2:57:37 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: its more of a figure of unity - its not a powerful entity Mar 18, 2007 2:58:00 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: the force from the UN comes from its member countries cooperation Mar 18, 2007 2:58:10 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well in order for the UN to be effective, they all have to be in agreement, and obviously not everyone is in agreemnet over this war Mar 18, 2007 2:58:11 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: obviously if the U.S. doesn't cooperate, as with Iraq, the UN becomes weaker Mar 18, 2007 2:58:31 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: That is true Mar 18, 2007 2:58:32 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so what kind of example is the US setting? Mar 18, 2007 2:58:47 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: What kind of example is the UN setting Mar 18, 2007 2:58:57 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: its not about setting an example Mar 18, 2007 2:59:18 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: a peace-keeping one Mar 18, 2007 2:59:20 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: that's its purpose anyway Mar 18, 2007 2:59:28 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: so are you saying the UN should have more of a say in the actions one country wants to take against another? Mar 18, 2007 2:59:39 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so, should the UN be dissolved? Mar 18, 2007 2:59:42 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Does it really seem like there would be Peace in Iraq had we not come in...granted there is still violence, relatively it is a lesser amount Mar 18, 2007 2:59:54 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: There is atleast a chance for democracy now Mar 18, 2007 3:00:09 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so the US should push democracy on everyone? Mar 18, 2007 3:00:23 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: yeah, i dont think you realize how bad saddam's regime was? Mar 18, 2007 3:00:25 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i don't you realize how bad it is now Mar 18, 2007 3:00:37 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Unfortunately, this world we live in does not allow for peace to accomplish all great hings Mar 18, 2007 3:00:39 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Relatively better though Klutzo Mar 18, 2007 3:00:54 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: we are not saying democracy for everyone Mar 18, 2007 3:01:05 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: than why just Iraqis? Mar 18, 2007 3:01:16 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: there are places where governments work just fine, but ideally, yes, all citizens should have a say in their society Mar 18, 2007 3:01:24 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Because we can't take on the world all at once Mar 18, 2007 3:01:30 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: you miss the idea of limited resources Mar 18, 2007 3:01:35 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Let me explain Mar 18, 2007 3:01:40 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so who is next? Mar 18, 2007 3:01:40 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: We live on a planet, a finite space - thus having finit resources Mar 18, 2007 3:01:54 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: finite* Mar 18, 2007 3:01:58 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Who's to say, one country at a time. Mar 18, 2007 3:02:07 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Who do you think Mar 18, 2007 3:02:13 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: exactly, how do you go about making that decision Mar 18, 2007 3:02:25 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: how does anyone Mar 18, 2007 3:02:28 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: even the president Mar 18, 2007 3:02:31 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: does he even have that right Mar 18, 2007 3:02:37 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: wait you really think we should just hop along country to country setting up democracies? Mar 18, 2007 3:02:40 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Hopefully our decision makes can make an adequate decision Mar 18, 2007 3:02:44 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: doesnt the U.S. have enough internal problems to deal with? Mar 18, 2007 3:02:48 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: so are we all doomed? Mar 18, 2007 3:02:51 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: shouldn't we fix ouselves before we go fixing other countries Mar 18, 2007 3:03:00 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: So we should be selfish and turn our backs to the world Mar 18, 2007 3:03:07 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: we can do more than one thing at a time Mar 18, 2007 3:03:18 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: maybe the world doesnt want our help Mar 18, 2007 3:03:24 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: How can we ever really be fixed - if by fixed you mean perfect, that is impossible Mar 18, 2007 3:03:26 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: did you ever think about that> Mar 18, 2007 3:03:29 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Some places, no Mar 18, 2007 3:03:33 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I most certainly did Mar 18, 2007 3:03:38 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but you seem to be missing the core of this argument Mar 18, 2007 3:03:43 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: which is... Mar 18, 2007 3:03:48 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: there are people out there who need help, and it is our duty to help them if they so chose Mar 18, 2007 3:03:57 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but Iraqis didn't choose Mar 18, 2007 3:04:09 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: you know one of the major problems with a democracy is finding someone to run it, and it's a lot easier to put a corrupt leader in power then to find a just one Mar 18, 2007 3:04:13 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and why is it our duty Mar 18, 2007 3:04:13 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: That celebration did not show signs of welcomeness? Mar 18, 2007 3:04:24 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: because were the strongest nation in the world Mar 18, 2007 3:04:26 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Were you in a cave during that time? Mar 18, 2007 3:04:31 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: lets not get to heated! Mar 18, 2007 3:04:57 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: they still didnt ask us to come in, Mar 18, 2007 3:04:59 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: are we really the strongest nation Mar 18, 2007 3:05:12 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: How could they, they would be put to death by their leaders Mar 18, 2007 3:05:13 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: maybe we're just a big bully Mar 18, 2007 3:05:19 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Who's to say, certainly economically yes Mar 18, 2007 3:05:20 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I can live with bullying tyrannical powers Mar 18, 2007 3:05:32 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: we're so afraid of what other countries will do Mar 18, 2007 3:06:10 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: What? Mar 18, 2007 3:06:19 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: with weapons of mass destruction and stuff Mar 18, 2007 3:06:21 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Shouldn't we Mar 18, 2007 3:06:28 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: they could harm you Mar 18, 2007 3:06:31 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yet we are the only nation that has every actually used nuclear weapons Mar 18, 2007 3:06:33 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: don't you see the irony Mar 18, 2007 3:06:41 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: if anyone should be afraid, it's other countries, of us Mar 18, 2007 3:06:50 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: sadamm has used chemical WMDs on the kurds Mar 18, 2007 3:06:53 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: just not nuclear Mar 18, 2007 3:07:08 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: rocket ship i think you're making the idea of democracy sound a lot easier than it actually is Mar 18, 2007 3:07:28 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Clearly it is extremely difficult or this "magic trick" of a war would be over now Mar 18, 2007 3:07:48 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: It is not easy Mar 18, 2007 3:08:02 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I have read history, America's in particular Mar 18, 2007 3:08:10 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: It would be ridiculous to think that it is easy. Mar 18, 2007 3:08:17 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: did outside forces impose democracy on America? Mar 18, 2007 3:08:29 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: it's more likely that democracy in Iraq will fail than succeed Mar 18, 2007 3:08:32 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: We have democracy Mar 18, 2007 3:08:39 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: why would they Mar 18, 2007 3:08:42 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: OK I think that we are going to have to move on to our next topic in a minute Mar 18, 2007 3:08:44 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so then why would we impose it on Iraq? Mar 18, 2007 3:08:51 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: They didnt Mar 18, 2007 3:08:56 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: ...? Mar 18, 2007 3:09:01 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Pretty clear-cut Mar 18, 2007 3:09:13 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: they didnt what? Mar 18, 2007 3:09:20 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i just think it not our place to question the decision makers Mar 18, 2007 3:09:21 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Have democracy Mar 18, 2007 3:09:26 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: that's what a democracy is all about Mar 18, 2007 3:09:33 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: quest Mar 18, 2007 3:09:37 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: sorry Mar 18, 2007 3:09:47 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: didnt mean to type that Mar 18, 2007 3:09:51 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: So then you admit we have a democracy in America Mar 18, 2007 3:09:54 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: when a society is that corrupt, it will take decades for it to instate an actual working goverment and in that time they'll probably just destry themselves Mar 18, 2007 3:10:02 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yes, why would i say we didnt? Mar 18, 2007 3:10:08 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: So just not even try Janada? Mar 18, 2007 3:10:15 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well it's not up to us Mar 18, 2007 3:10:29 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: You said other countries aren't imposing Dem. on us - it's because we have it! Mar 18, 2007 3:10:29 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: OK can everyone give a final wrap up sentence? Mar 18, 2007 3:10:31 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: it's up to them, if they want democracy then they'll work for it Mar 18, 2007 3:10:41 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i'm talking about when we first achieved independence Mar 18, 2007 3:10:47 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: it's not gonna happen just because we want it to Mar 18, 2007 3:10:49 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: As people of planet earth, it is up to us to aide each other Mar 18, 2007 3:10:52 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Let the informed people make informed decisions Mar 18, 2007 3:10:57 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: since you were talking about history Mar 18, 2007 3:10:58 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: No, there has to be action! Mar 18, 2007 3:11:00 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: we've pointed them in the right direction haven't we? Mar 18, 2007 3:11:08 PM EDT
