Nicole Becker: The NSA has a database of millions of calls made by US citizens. The new survey (released this week) found that 63 percent of Americans said they found the NSA program to be an acceptable way to investigate terrorism, including 44 percent who strongly endorsed the effort. Another 35 percent said the program was unacceptable, which included 24 percent who strongly objected to it. Thoughts? Apr 17, 2007 8:09:48 PM EDT

CMC livingdeadbeat87: so you want the govt "using" your phone calls? Apr 17, 2007 8:11:27 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: it depends how they use it Apr 17, 2007 8:11:33 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: like if they suspect someone.....then i think it is ok to monitor them, but i mean....otherwise it is a drastic invasion of privacey Apr 17, 2007 8:12:13 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: like...i would not really care if some govt official listened in to my convo to my mom or someting Apr 17, 2007 8:12:36 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: its still an invasion of privacy Apr 17, 2007 8:12:37 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: but like.....i would not like it if it happened all the time Apr 17, 2007 8:12:48 PM EDT

CMC spacestare86: but then i was going to say Apr 17, 2007 8:13:11 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: how could you ever know that a 2 person convo is really a 2 person convo without a third listener Apr 17, 2007 8:13:43 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i think i would hate it if i realized they were listening to me Apr 17, 2007 8:13:58 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: unless they are given a warrant, i think phone monitoring should not be allowed Apr 17, 2007 8:14:25 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: right now were being monitored Apr 17, 2007 8:14:32 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: but we know it Apr 17, 2007 8:14:41 PM EDT

CMC spacestare86: but again,...it is a good point Apr 17, 2007 8:15:18 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: but how can one be given a search warrant to monitor phone lines? Apr 17, 2007 8:15:28 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: we know about this specific monitoring, vs. when they do it on our phones without telling us or our permission Apr 17, 2007 8:15:39 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: and doesnt a search warrant imply that the suspect has some idea that they are being monitored? Apr 17, 2007 8:15:54 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yes Apr 17, 2007 8:16:01 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: it does Apr 17, 2007 8:16:03 PM EDT

CMC spacestare86: b/c i feel as soon as someone knows they are being monitored...if they are bad,...obv they are not going to do anything or say anything to incriminate themselves Apr 17, 2007 8:16:54 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: so i guesss what i am saying is that Apr 17, 2007 8:17:13 PM EDT

CMC spacestare86: i agree Apr 17, 2007 8:21:40 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: well its not supposed to be public necessarily Apr 17, 2007 8:21:44 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: facebook isnt Apr 17, 2007 8:21:52 PM EDT

CMC frankie27: i cant type in a site and view a convo Apr 17, 2007 8:24:30 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: it has to be an aol admin Apr 17, 2007 8:24:34 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: true Apr 17, 2007 8:24:36 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i dont know Apr 17, 2007 8:24:48 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i dont really think there is much of a prob with aim convos and other people "reading them" is there? Apr 17, 2007 8:25:11 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: i dont think so Apr 17, 2007 8:25:23 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: sure there is Apr 17, 2007 8:25:55 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: really? Apr 17, 2007 8:26:09 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: you dont think the govt has listened in on AIM convos? Apr 17, 2007 8:26:16 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: never really thought about it Apr 17, 2007 8:26:29 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: they probably can Apr 17, 2007 8:26:30 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: but its pretty confidential Apr 17, 2007 8:26:37 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: u dont even have to give a real name Apr 17, 2007 8:26:43 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah Apr 17, 2007 8:27:01 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: plus you can always say it wasnt u typing Apr 17, 2007 8:27:03 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: or wutever Apr 17, 2007 8:27:07 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: true Apr 17, 2007 8:27:07 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: but they can track your IP address, and know who purchased the computer Apr 17, 2007 8:27:45 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: but what if someone else was on ur comp Apr 17, 2007 8:27:58 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: on ur Aim name Apr 17, 2007 8:28:05 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: it is still pretty hard to prove Apr 17, 2007 8:28:13 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: tru Apr 17, 2007 8:28:33 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: but you let this person on your computer then Apr 17, 2007 8:28:44 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: no...you might not know Apr 17, 2007 8:28:55 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: what if it is just on ur desk and ur out of the room Apr 17, 2007 8:29:07 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and the door was left open Apr 17, 2007 8:29:12 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and someone came in and got on ur comp and u happened to be on aim Apr 17, 2007 8:29:25 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: thats agood point Apr 17, 2007 8:29:30 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and thus they used it Apr 17, 2007 8:29:31 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: but i dont think the feds will believe that Apr 17, 2007 8:29:44 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: hres gotta b a way toprove it\ Apr 17, 2007 8:29:56 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: and it happened to be at the same time that this persons terrorist friend was on AIM to discuss bombmaking plans on another borrowed computer? Apr 17, 2007 8:30:05 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: but i am sure there is some lawer out there who would defend you trying to make a name for himself Apr 17, 2007 8:30:13 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: with the amount of text message on aim that occur, i doubt theyre all filtered Apr 17, 2007 8:30:53 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: thats not the point Apr 17, 2007 8:30:54 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well fingerprints.....like if it did really happen there would be many diff fingerprings and oils from your skin on the keys Apr 17, 2007 8:31:04 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: that doesnt matter Apr 17, 2007 8:31:19 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: what matters is they do read conversations Apr 17, 2007 8:31:34 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: unless the police know exactly who to track, they will probably not find some random person talking about terrorism Apr 17, 2007 8:31:38 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: and that is still a privacy issue Apr 17, 2007 8:31:43 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: true Apr 17, 2007 8:31:56 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: so should we allow it? Apr 17, 2007 8:32:18 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: wut can we do about it? Apr 17, 2007 8:32:32 PM EDT

CMC spacestare86: yeah were pretty much screwd Apr 17, 2007 8:33:12 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: the question is: does this violate ourprivacy rights Apr 17, 2007 8:33:20 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: i guess i can say that about anything tho Apr 17, 2007 8:33:22 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: well yes it does Apr 17, 2007 8:33:43 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: sure it does violate them Apr 17, 2007 8:33:43 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: no doubt about it Apr 17, 2007 8:33:47 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: b/c we didn't give permission Apr 17, 2007 8:33:57 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i will once again quote one of my favorite quotes that several of you have nod oubt heard before Apr 17, 2007 8:34:02 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: its now become so hard to draw a line Apr 17, 2007 8:34:02 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: so thus a violatoin Apr 17, 2007 8:34:15 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: yea exactly Apr 17, 2007 8:34:34 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. Apr 17, 2007 8:34:38 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: yea it is because like yall said we didnt give them permission Apr 17, 2007 8:34:45 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i agree Apr 17, 2007 8:35:00 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i dont think i understand the quote...why would they not deserve liberty or safty? Apr 17, 2007 8:35:41 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: if they made a compromise? Apr 17, 2007 8:35:52 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: huh? Apr 17, 2007 8:35:57 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: because they made a compromise Apr 17, 2007 8:36:21 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: thats exactly why they dont deserve it Apr 17, 2007 8:36:35 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: why would they get neither though? Apr 17, 2007 8:36:35 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: they dont get neither Apr 17, 2007 8:37:03 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: they DESERVE neither Apr 17, 2007 8:37:08 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: its not that they wouldnt get either, but they wouldnt deserve neither Apr 17, 2007 8:37:14 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: why? Apr 17, 2007 8:37:32 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: jinx Apr 17, 2007 8:37:34 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: what is the reasonig behind that quote? Apr 17, 2007 8:37:56 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: we should never give up our liberty Apr 17, 2007 8:38:23 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well eyah Apr 17, 2007 8:38:27 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: that i agree with Apr 17, 2007 8:38:32 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: because our liberties are innate to all americans, they are fundamental aspects of who we are, if we give that up who are we Apr 17, 2007 8:38:42 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: nothing Apr 17, 2007 8:38:53 PM EDT
