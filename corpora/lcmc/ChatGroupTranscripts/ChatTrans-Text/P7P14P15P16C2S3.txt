Nicole Becker: your first topic is gender discrimination Apr 3, 2007 7:10:26 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: here's a little story to get you started Apr 3, 2007 7:10:47 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (give me a minute to type it up) Apr 3, 2007 7:10:58 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: no prob Apr 3, 2007 7:11:06 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: In Maryland recently, several IT executives are being investigated for creating a minortiy-owned business that was just a front. The executives' wives were listed as the heads of the business so that they could more easily procure government contracts targeted at minority and women-owned businesses. But there were no employees-- all the work was to be done by the firms headed by the male executives Apr 3, 2007 7:12:03 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: well heres a good example of reverse discrimination Apr 3, 2007 7:13:00 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: oh i get it now...this i not ur typical gender discrimination Apr 3, 2007 7:13:38 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: why should businesses with women and minorities as heads more easily get money? Apr 3, 2007 7:13:54 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: because they have always had to struggle Apr 3, 2007 7:14:12 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: yea that doesnt seem right Apr 3, 2007 7:14:18 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: any kind of gender discrimination can be discussed. Apr 3, 2007 7:14:20 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well, they shouldn't but the govt feels sorry for treating them like crap most of the time Apr 3, 2007 7:14:28 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: well we probably shouldnt just give out money to whoever we feel sorry for Apr 3, 2007 7:14:57 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: because then...we wouldnt have any money Apr 3, 2007 7:15:07 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: no i agree Apr 3, 2007 7:15:13 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: kinda like affirmative action Apr 3, 2007 7:15:13 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i understand that its not fair for male owned businesses to be recievin a cut just becuz they are male but if you think about women and minorities had to struggle to get the same rights as males Apr 3, 2007 7:15:28 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: exactly like affirmative action Apr 3, 2007 7:15:30 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: I agree with sun_beauty Apr 3, 2007 7:15:46 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: but then again....i also think that the whole field should just be equaled out Apr 3, 2007 7:16:01 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i think they will be equalled out when the playing fields are leveled Apr 3, 2007 7:16:24 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: how is this "affirmative action for women" leveling the playing field tho? Apr 3, 2007 7:16:47 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: i dont know if it should really be the govts job to regulate business like this though Apr 3, 2007 7:16:51 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: so that one does not have to worry about males or females having an easier time thean the other Apr 3, 2007 7:16:52 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: its giving the edge to non-white men tho Apr 3, 2007 7:17:19 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: so its not equal Apr 3, 2007 7:17:24 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i agree with frankie27 Apr 3, 2007 7:17:59 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: so whats the world gonna be like when black women get paid more than men just because of their race/gender, not because of the amount of work they do Apr 3, 2007 7:18:03 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well if u think about it...non white men and women are often treated the same Apr 3, 2007 7:18:06 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: yea they are Apr 3, 2007 7:18:28 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: well then the playing fields will have leveled and affirmative action will be tossed out the door Apr 3, 2007 7:18:40 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: becuz by that time everyone will be recievin the same opportunities Apr 3, 2007 7:18:59 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: so the real issue is not really about the money,....it is about the treatment of different races and genders verses the typical white male Apr 3, 2007 7:19:14 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: but u cant try to force it like this Apr 3, 2007 7:19:24 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah you cant force it Apr 3, 2007 7:19:46 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: yea that is tru becuz if you think about even white women have to struggle Apr 3, 2007 7:19:54 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: b/c then people only meet it with resistance Apr 3, 2007 7:19:57 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: what do you mean by ppl cant try to force it? Apr 3, 2007 7:20:18 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: aff. action is forcing it Apr 3, 2007 7:20:27 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: oh ok Apr 3, 2007 7:20:33 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and if it is met with resistance...then it is still not really equal Apr 3, 2007 7:20:34 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: i mean the govt shouldnt try to "force" equality by giving an edge to certain people Apr 3, 2007 7:20:46 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: but then wat other way is there Apr 3, 2007 7:21:02 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: its just a logical contradiction Apr 3, 2007 7:21:05 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: oh i c then Apr 3, 2007 7:21:15 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: the other way is time Apr 3, 2007 7:21:24 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well....for one thing, instead of giving certain people the edge or not Apr 3, 2007 7:21:26 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: to let nature run its course Apr 3, 2007 7:21:26 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: so what if nature is a world with white males succeeding then its ok? Apr 3, 2007 7:21:52 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: you should just not have to tell if ur not a white male or if u are Apr 3, 2007 7:21:58 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and then companies would be based on themselves....not by who runs them Apr 3, 2007 7:22:18 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: but people will always be curious whos running them Apr 3, 2007 7:22:32 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: eventually, with subsidizing city schools and giving everyone equal opportunities, plus anti-racist teaching, hopefully in future generations racism and gender inequalities will disappear Apr 3, 2007 7:22:41 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: but we cant do what were doing now Apr 3, 2007 7:22:58 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: in a perfect world yea Apr 3, 2007 7:22:59 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: that is a great hope.....but i fear that would ever happen Apr 3, 2007 7:23:08 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: lol yea tru Apr 3, 2007 7:23:10 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: b/c people are always going to have egos Apr 3, 2007 7:23:22 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i feel that it may it will jus take some time Apr 3, 2007 7:23:24 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: it may die out though Apr 3, 2007 7:23:33 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i mean it will never die out completely Apr 3, 2007 7:23:43 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: with the older generation dyin out so will many of their ideas Apr 3, 2007 7:23:47 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: but eventually it will helplevel the playing ground Apr 3, 2007 7:23:55 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: hopefully....but again, everyone has some sort of an ego Apr 3, 2007 7:24:43 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: umm i dont think so Apr 3, 2007 7:24:56 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: you keep saying ego, im not sure if thats the right word... Apr 3, 2007 7:24:58 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: i think maybe men and women are just not meant to be equal Apr 3, 2007 7:24:59 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: they tend to have talents in different areas Apr 3, 2007 7:25:08 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: yea i agree with livingdeadbeat Apr 3, 2007 7:25:14 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: mayb the word is throwin me off from agreein wit u Apr 3, 2007 7:25:29 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: hummmm it might not be the right word....let me think Apr 3, 2007 7:25:40 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: superego? Apr 3, 2007 7:25:52 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: how bout take out the word ego. Apr 3, 2007 7:26:09 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: maybe bias is the word, or gender stereotype Apr 3, 2007 7:26:33 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: haha i feel like we are talking about sigmund froid.....(sp?) Apr 3, 2007 7:26:33 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: lol...better Apr 3, 2007 7:26:56 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: so we're saying that this word, whatever it is, will always exist? Apr 3, 2007 7:27:29 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: bias....yeah that sounds close enough for what i am trying to say right now Apr 3, 2007 7:27:35 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: like you always feel as if you can do someting better than someone Apr 3, 2007 7:28:06 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: anyway, there are many reasons that gender discrimination exists, and it shouldnt be the govt's job to fix these by just giving businesses money who give them important jobs Apr 3, 2007 7:28:11 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: yea thats just the easiest thing for the govt to do Apr 3, 2007 7:28:32 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: give out money Apr 3, 2007 7:28:35 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah....thats what i was trying to say earlier about not looking at who owned the companines Apr 3, 2007 7:28:38 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: tru...shell out some money that will shut ppl up Apr 3, 2007 7:28:46 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: exactly Apr 3, 2007 7:28:52 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: the govt has screwed up, men have screwed up, feminists have definitely screwed up they havent really done jack Apr 3, 2007 7:28:55 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: ummm...the vote? Apr 3, 2007 7:29:11 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: what do u mean by the feminist part? Apr 3, 2007 7:29:15 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i mean feminists today have failed and instead of promoting gender equality they tend to project an image that they want to be men, and havent ending up solving anything Apr 3, 2007 7:30:04 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: ohhh!!! Apr 3, 2007 7:30:23 PM EDT

CMC sun_beauty: ryte? Apr 3, 2007 7:30:47 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: no Apr 3, 2007 7:30:56 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: they were supposed to fight for equality, a noble cause Apr 3, 2007 7:31:09 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: tru Apr 3, 2007 7:31:14 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and they did back when the vote came about Apr 3, 2007 7:31:23 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: instead, now they are just anti-male Apr 3, 2007 7:31:27 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: but they too often just sound bitter toward men Apr 3, 2007 7:31:28 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: exactly Apr 3, 2007 7:31:35 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and women first started to break into the workforce Apr 3, 2007 7:31:41 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: but feminists now i feel have drastically changed Apr 3, 2007 7:31:50 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: they do...they walk aorund sayin men cant do this and men cant do that Apr 3, 2007 7:31:52 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and i do agree....now they just seem to hate men b/c they can Apr 3, 2007 7:32:04 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: not very logical Apr 3, 2007 7:32:16 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: tru Apr 3, 2007 7:32:21 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i mean, feminists like mary daley believe that the world would be better off if there were just dramatically less men on the planet Apr 3, 2007 7:32:26 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: thats just stupid Apr 3, 2007 7:32:38 PM EDT

CMC frankie27: but in business... Apr 3, 2007 7:33:24 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: women still have power in certain businesses Apr 3, 2007 7:33:35 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: in buiness there is the glass ciling a lot of the time Apr 3, 2007 7:33:44 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: exactly Apr 3, 2007 7:33:51 PM EDT
