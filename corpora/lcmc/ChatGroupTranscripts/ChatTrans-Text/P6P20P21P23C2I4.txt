CMC dah88: i think hes human and hes doin all he can Mar 25, 2007 5:06:54 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well, i think that we should still stay there, but i don't think that constantly throwing in troops will help Mar 25, 2007 5:07:04 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i blame his administration, of which he's just a figurehead Mar 25, 2007 5:07:11 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah, same Mar 25, 2007 5:07:17 PM EDT
CMC dah88: if we're gonna stay there thats what has to happen Mar 25, 2007 5:07:20 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, he came at basically the worst time possible Mar 25, 2007 5:07:23 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Mar 25, 2007 5:07:29 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but "stay the course" isn't a great motto Mar 25, 2007 5:07:32 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: SOMEthing has to change Mar 25, 2007 5:07:40 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i think there needs to be a plan for a phased withdrawal Mar 25, 2007 5:07:42 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Mar 25, 2007 5:07:45 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: difinitely Mar 25, 2007 5:07:49 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: very true Mar 25, 2007 5:08:01 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think we should pull out - this war is evolving into a world war - it is US against the world Mar 25, 2007 5:08:05 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and definite plans for any aid we give to iraq afterwards Mar 25, 2007 5:08:06 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: the current negotiations seem to involve dividing the country into sections Mar 25, 2007 5:08:11 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: hmm Mar 25, 2007 5:08:36 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i feel like we cnt do anything to help if the country itself is fighting with ecah other Mar 25, 2007 5:08:48 PM EDT
CMC dah88: itself* Mar 25, 2007 5:09:01 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well it's not really us against everyone in the world i don't htink Mar 25, 2007 5:09:04 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats only a good idea if iraqis would support that and keep it that way once we left Mar 25, 2007 5:09:07 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah. that's kind of why it was dumb to go in in the first place Mar 25, 2007 5:09:18 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i dont think so either- i just think we're not being supported Mar 25, 2007 5:09:21 PM EDT
CMC dah88: we're not Mar 25, 2007 5:09:27 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: right Mar 25, 2007 5:09:31 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: the world sucks Mar 25, 2007 5:09:34 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 25, 2007 5:09:34 PM EDT
CMC dah88: we went into the war because of our emotions Mar 25, 2007 5:09:41 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but it's not liekt he rest of the world is fighting us Mar 25, 2007 5:09:41 PM EDT
CMC dah88: it was an irrational desicion Mar 25, 2007 5:09:47 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: it really was Mar 25, 2007 5:09:52 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: iunno about that Mar 25, 2007 5:09:59 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: originally, it was a great decision Mar 25, 2007 5:10:09 PM EDT
CMC dah88: its us against the world in the fact that the rest of the world has so many problems Mar 25, 2007 5:10:10 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i just think that it kind of wore down Mar 25, 2007 5:10:14 PM EDT
CMC dah88: a great decision? Mar 25, 2007 5:10:19 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: ?? Mar 25, 2007 5:10:27 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: going there in the first place, hell eyah Mar 25, 2007 5:10:33 PM EDT
CMC dah88: y? Mar 25, 2007 5:10:38 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well for a great decision it wasn't well planned Mar 25, 2007 5:10:38 PM EDT
CMC dah88: we had no plan Mar 25, 2007 5:10:46 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: you'd be saying the same thing if it was after 9/11 Mar 25, 2007 5:10:46 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i did Mar 25, 2007 5:10:52 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but we had no plan Mar 25, 2007 5:10:56 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yes.... Mar 25, 2007 5:10:56 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i would Mar 25, 2007 5:11:00 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that's all i was saying Mar 25, 2007 5:11:04 PM EDT
CMC dah88: ok Mar 25, 2007 5:11:08 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 25, 2007 5:11:10 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i never thought it was a good idea to go into iraq Mar 25, 2007 5:11:22 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i was very pro war in the beginning Mar 25, 2007 5:11:23 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i was greatly effected by 9/11 Mar 25, 2007 5:11:36 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i don't think it was a good decision, and i think the administration came into office with the intent to go to war in iraq Mar 25, 2007 5:11:37 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i don't know about that Mar 25, 2007 5:11:48 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think that's crap Mar 25, 2007 5:11:50 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: does that go with the "we went in just for the oil" theory? Mar 25, 2007 5:12:00 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that's bullshit Mar 25, 2007 5:12:07 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: cuz i don't know the facts on either Mar 25, 2007 5:12:09 PM EDT
CMC dah88: nah Mar 25, 2007 5:12:14 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: not necessarily. the treasury secretary who quit said that there were talks of going into iraq prior to 9/11 Mar 25, 2007 5:12:27 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: oooo wow Mar 25, 2007 5:12:37 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i dont kno about that Mar 25, 2007 5:12:39 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: there would have been a lot of reasons for it, besides oil Mar 25, 2007 5:12:47 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: what was their rationale then? do u know? Mar 25, 2007 5:12:48 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i feel like taht just to cover up their mistake of making an irrational decision Mar 25, 2007 5:12:54 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: to oust saddam, to stabilize the middle east, etc. Mar 25, 2007 5:13:09 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but there was already crap going on there with sadaam and the way he was running th country Mar 25, 2007 5:13:11 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: the terrors that he created were horrible Mar 25, 2007 5:13:18 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Mar 25, 2007 5:13:25 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, yeah, but more iraqis have died in the war than did by his hand Mar 25, 2007 5:13:40 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: if the U.S. started helping, maybe the rest of the world would catch on and help us.... Mar 25, 2007 5:13:45 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but they suck Mar 25, 2007 5:13:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 25, 2007 5:13:48 PM EDT
CMC dah88: if we pull out - does anyon feel like a terrorist attck would ne more likely to occur? Mar 25, 2007 5:14:05 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: not really Mar 25, 2007 5:14:11 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i think the potentiality is there one way or another Mar 25, 2007 5:14:19 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: we still have our hyped up security Mar 25, 2007 5:14:20 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Mar 25, 2007 5:14:30 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: it would happen either way, if it was going to Mar 25, 2007 5:14:31 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i guess so Mar 25, 2007 5:14:38 PM EDT
CMC dah88: what about the draft? Mar 25, 2007 5:14:51 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i don't really have a basis to form an opinion on that...the terrorists atacking... Mar 25, 2007 5:15:02 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i have a question - do you think women would be included in a new draft, since our roles have changed so much? Mar 25, 2007 5:15:19 PM EDT
CMC dah88: wow interesting point Mar 25, 2007 5:15:30 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i think that's a big reason no politician has seriously proposed it Mar 25, 2007 5:15:35 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah probably Mar 25, 2007 5:15:43 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: that would be scary =-O Mar 25, 2007 5:15:44 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha Mar 25, 2007 5:15:48 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think that guys should go first... Mar 25, 2007 5:15:52 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: not to offend you ladies Mar 25, 2007 5:15:55 PM EDT
CMC dah88: hey i agree lol Mar 25, 2007 5:16:00 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: man, i seem really sexist today Mar 25, 2007 5:16:01 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: hey hey, none taken Mar 25, 2007 5:16:03 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 25, 2007 5:16:04 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i'd be in canada anyhow Mar 25, 2007 5:16:08 PM EDT
CMC dah88: lol Mar 25, 2007 5:16:08 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: lol Mar 25, 2007 5:16:13 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i would be honored to be drafted in all honesty Mar 25, 2007 5:16:20 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i kno alot of guys that feel taht way Mar 25, 2007 5:16:29 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i would be scared as shit Mar 25, 2007 5:16:30 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i admire it really Mar 25, 2007 5:16:34 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: jeez, i'd be happy to serve Mar 25, 2007 5:16:44 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i admire, but don't understand Mar 25, 2007 5:16:51 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i feel like the draft would hieghten the awareness of the war amongst people our age Mar 25, 2007 5:17:00 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i'm never going to enlist because i have a lot going for me here at loyola Mar 25, 2007 5:17:01 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i feel like they dont care about it Mar 25, 2007 5:17:11 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Mar 25, 2007 5:17:18 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think the draft would definitely make people care... Mar 25, 2007 5:17:21 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Mar 25, 2007 5:17:25 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i would never consider enlisting with an administration like the current one calling the shots Mar 25, 2007 5:17:30 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but should we have to threaten them with serving overseas in war to get some emotions up? Mar 25, 2007 5:17:36 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but if i was forced to do it, then it wouldn't be as honorable as if i had enlisted in the first, place, but if it was at that point, then i know that the country needs my help- is the rationale Mar 25, 2007 5:17:37 PM EDT
CMC dah88: especially people in their late teens early 20s Mar 25, 2007 5:17:37 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: right, frogger, thats why i would be scared! Mar 25, 2007 5:17:47 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i think re-instituting the draft to educate the public is extreme. that's basically sacrificing more lives in order to get a point across Mar 25, 2007 5:19:07 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: not knowing whether i'd be gone for 2 years or 10, and whether bush would decide to declare war on someone else in the meantime, would freak me out Mar 25, 2007 5:19:25 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i agree but what wopuld get them to care Mar 25, 2007 5:19:28 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, i agree with you frogger Mar 25, 2007 5:19:30 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: me too Mar 25, 2007 5:19:44 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i mean - we kno that angelina and brad adopted again but we dont kno about roadside bombs Mar 25, 2007 5:19:58 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i don't thinkt hat the draft should EVER be used in that sense...only in the case that we actually NEED it Mar 25, 2007 5:19:59 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i just don't know, dah, i don't think we can ever recreate the 70s Mar 25, 2007 5:20:00 PM EDT
CMC dah88: true Mar 25, 2007 5:20:12 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, that was a very particular climate Mar 25, 2007 5:20:23 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: (social climate, i mean) Mar 25, 2007 5:20:31 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i wish i lived back then....:-( Mar 25, 2007 5:20:39 PM EDT
CMC dah88: really? Mar 25, 2007 5:21:01 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: certainly would have been interesting Mar 25, 2007 5:21:11 PM EDT
CMC dah88: hah yeah Mar 25, 2007 5:21:15 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: indeed Mar 25, 2007 5:21:57 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: so why do you think the war in vietnam had such a different response from home, if iraq is compared to vietnam every day? Mar 25, 2007 5:22:50 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think because of the draft Mar 25, 2007 5:23:10 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: the draft, primarily. everybody knew somebody who was there Mar 25, 2007 5:23:10 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yup Mar 25, 2007 5:23:20 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah Mar 25, 2007 5:23:35 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but on the other hand Mar 25, 2007 5:23:39 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: and the reasons for being there were at least as hard to justify, and the death toll was much higher Mar 25, 2007 5:23:43 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: people coming back from Nam were like spit on and stuff Mar 25, 2007 5:23:47 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Mar 25, 2007 5:24:02 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: so you can't say that they didn't like the war because they lvoed everybody over there Mar 25, 2007 5:24:05 PM EDT
CMC dah88: that crazy Mar 25, 2007 5:24:07 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: the people protesting sucked a lot of the time Mar 25, 2007 5:24:16 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, that pisses me off Mar 25, 2007 5:24:21 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, know, but people didn WANT to go, which is different Mar 25, 2007 5:24:22 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Mar 25, 2007 5:24:34 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: which makes it worse that they were treated that way Mar 25, 2007 5:24:41 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, but when those people who didnt' WANT to go came back, they were spit on and made fun of, etc. Mar 25, 2007 5:24:48 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: at least we honor our soldiers in iraq Mar 25, 2007 5:24:49 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i don't feel like we do Mar 25, 2007 5:25:04 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Mar 25, 2007 5:25:04 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well, as much as we can Mar 25, 2007 5:25:10 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think there are still those people who dont but i think alot do Mar 25, 2007 5:25:22 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think that us saying how much we dont support the war makes them feel as though they are pointless over there Mar 25, 2007 5:25:29 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well yeah, but it's hard to generalize about people's behavior toward the soldiers then.... Mar 25, 2007 5:25:33 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: and even now Mar 25, 2007 5:25:39 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i agree Mar 25, 2007 5:25:42 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i kno people who have been over there and would go back in a day Mar 25, 2007 5:25:56 PM EDT
CMC dah88: they really believe in the cause Mar 25, 2007 5:26:03 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: wow, true Mar 25, 2007 5:26:05 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: seriously Mar 25, 2007 5:26:14 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i talked with a guy Mar 25, 2007 5:26:17 PM EDT
CMC dah88: and they say that the iraqi's love seeing them Mar 25, 2007 5:26:17 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: and he said that if we pulled out Mar 25, 2007 5:26:23 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: all of his friends, he and EVERYONE he knows in the army, would feel as though all of their friends have died in vain Mar 25, 2007 5:26:40 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think just because we don't support the war doesn't mean we shouldn't support the soldiers Mar 25, 2007 5:26:46 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: wow Mar 25, 2007 5:26:49 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah wow Mar 25, 2007 5:27:07 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats just leaving cold turkey though? Mar 25, 2007 5:27:08 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, nobody's talking about going cold turkey at this point, though Mar 25, 2007 5:27:31 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: cuz i mean, we have to leave sometime, and iraq will probably never be what we started out to make it Mar 25, 2007 5:27:35 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: ok Mar 25, 2007 5:27:54 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Mar 25, 2007 5:28:09 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: the US has tried to establish democracies in lots of places, and it virtually always fails. it just isn't pragmatic to enforce a system of government Mar 25, 2007 5:29:06 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: right - we got to choose our own system of government Mar 25, 2007 5:29:51 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: hopw they're ruled over is something citizens tend to feel strongly about Mar 25, 2007 5:30:06 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: how* Mar 25, 2007 5:30:10 PM EDT
CMC dah88: well i think lot of the people in iraq and other places feel like we are intruding on their culture and tradition by trying to put our gov in their country Mar 25, 2007 5:30:13 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i feel we are too Mar 25, 2007 5:30:25 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right. there is now separation between church and state there. it just doesn't exist Mar 25, 2007 5:30:35 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Mar 25, 2007 5:31:27 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: *no separation Mar 25, 2007 5:32:00 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: sorry Mar 25, 2007 5:32:03 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: ooooo i agree <3 Mar 25, 2007 5:32:09 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i agree* lol sry i was confused Mar 25, 2007 5:32:22 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah, they dont have the right foundation for democracy at all Mar 25, 2007 5:32:45 PM EDT

CMC John_Bastow: much like it does in Iraq now Mar 25, 2007 5:33:51 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well thats because we didn't have to right foundation for a monarchy overseas to rule us Mar 25, 2007 5:34:12 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: when we revolted and formed our OWN govt, it worked pretty well Mar 25, 2007 5:34:29 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: except for the civil war... Mar 25, 2007 5:34:47 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but growing pains happen Mar 25, 2007 5:34:53 PM EDT
CMC dah88: which is pretty much going on in iraq Mar 25, 2007 5:34:58 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: it's an ethnic clash there, though, which is different Mar 25, 2007 5:35:14 PM EDT

CMC littlestanemone: they have a right to choose their own govenment Mar 25, 2007 5:37:18 PM EDT

CMC dah88: does everyone agree that the war was an irrational decision based on emotions? Mar 25, 2007 5:42:33 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: do you guys think that if the U.S. pulled out now, that the Iraqis would form a better government than what they have now? Mar 25, 2007 5:42:48 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i dont think so Mar 25, 2007 5:42:58 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (i don't think that it was irrational for the time) Mar 25, 2007 5:43:02 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think even if we pull out right now iraq will be in serious turmoil for years to come Mar 25, 2007 5:43:12 PM EDT
CMC dah88: only because of the chaos that was there b4 we arrived Mar 25, 2007 5:43:21 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: do you think that they'd be better off if the U.S was there ,or not? Mar 25, 2007 5:43:28 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think we have a big hand in their turmoil too Mar 25, 2007 5:43:34 PM EDT
CMC dah88: hearing from soldiers who were there - i think us being there is impt Mar 25, 2007 5:43:59 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i think it would be in turmoil one way or the other, to be honest. we're not going to suddenly eliminate the difference between shiites and sunnis Mar 25, 2007 5:44:06 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i really don't know Mar 25, 2007 5:44:08 PM EDT

CMC dah88: true Mar 25, 2007 5:44:22 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that's why i think we should stay there Mar 25, 2007 5:44:43 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: we can't stay for an indefinite period, though Mar 25, 2007 5:44:59 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, in response to the shiites and sunnies, that's too embedded in their culture...it's not gonna go away for God knows how long Mar 25, 2007 5:45:05 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well i dont think we should stay, but thats why i think we should pull out gradually Mar 25, 2007 5:45:11 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Mar 25, 2007 5:45:17 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah Mar 25, 2007 5:45:21 PM EDT

CMC John_Bastow: i know some politicians want to pull out everybody right away Mar 25, 2007 5:45:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i'm not into supporting that, i agree with you gusy Mar 25, 2007 5:45:54 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: maybe if we lessen our influence there some force from withink will pick up the slack Mar 25, 2007 5:45:56 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: what do you guys think would happen if we did just pull everybody out all at once? Mar 25, 2007 5:46:07 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: hmm... didn't someone use a jenga analogy last time? Mar 25, 2007 5:46:23 PM EDT
CMC dah88: im not sure it would be a huge difference Mar 25, 2007 5:46:30 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: for something else, but i think it applies here Mar 25, 2007 5:46:33 PM EDT
