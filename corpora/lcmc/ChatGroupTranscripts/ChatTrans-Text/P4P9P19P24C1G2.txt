Melissa Carbone: OK, is everyone ready? Mar 18, 2007 3:13:11 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yep Mar 18, 2007 3:13:15 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yes Mar 18, 2007 3:13:15 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: yeah Mar 18, 2007 3:13:20 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yup Mar 18, 2007 3:13:22 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: Your next topic is gay marriage, does anyone have any thoughts? Mar 18, 2007 3:13:37 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Opening thought - allowed, but under state not church. Mar 18, 2007 3:14:14 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: To some extent, even under church - we can get to that though. Mar 18, 2007 3:14:35 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well most churches probably wouldn't agree to it anyways Mar 18, 2007 3:14:36 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Agreed, but I hear recently the Episcopal church is making a turn Mar 18, 2007 3:15:06 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: which is splitting apart their organization Mar 18, 2007 3:15:12 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Half and half Mar 18, 2007 3:15:22 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what? Mar 18, 2007 3:15:23 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: really, that's interesting Mar 18, 2007 3:15:44 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: The International Episcopal church has one leader in the NorthEast who has proclaimed he is gay. Mar 18, 2007 3:15:51 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: people act like being gay is such a horrible thing Mar 18, 2007 3:16:17 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: and some congregations have agreed to follow him while others - especially internationally- have threatened to split off Mar 18, 2007 3:16:21 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: oh i see Mar 18, 2007 3:16:30 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but that's different from gay marriage Mar 18, 2007 3:16:38 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Really interesting though, to see atleast some other congregations following him Mar 18, 2007 3:16:45 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well it's hard to change centuries of thinking, especially if it's condmended in the Bible Mar 18, 2007 3:16:51 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: True, but it hits the gay topic within the Church Mar 18, 2007 3:17:00 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i have a question Mar 18, 2007 3:17:06 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Shoot Mar 18, 2007 3:17:11 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: should gay marriage be a national issue, or decided state by state Mar 18, 2007 3:17:22 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: state by state Mar 18, 2007 3:17:44 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i think it should be on par with straight marriage Mar 18, 2007 3:17:53 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: as of right now i believe, Vermont and New Jersey allow civil unions Mar 18, 2007 3:17:53 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Ideally, I wish it would be allowed internationally, but to truly work, I think state by state or country by country, the decision shoudl be made Mar 18, 2007 3:18:03 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and Massachusettes allows full marriage Mar 18, 2007 3:18:04 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: as does MA Mar 18, 2007 3:18:08 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: what makes gay marriage so different from straight marriage? Mar 18, 2007 3:19:48 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: why shouldnt they both be allowed? Mar 18, 2007 3:20:05 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: the Bible Mar 18, 2007 3:20:06 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i don't think there's really much of a difference at all Mar 18, 2007 3:20:15 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: that is the problem Mar 18, 2007 3:20:17 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: what does the Bible say? Mar 18, 2007 3:20:18 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: if anything, the institution of straight marriage is falling apart Mar 18, 2007 3:20:33 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: the divorce rate is over 50% Mar 18, 2007 3:20:39 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: in this country Mar 18, 2007 3:20:41 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: it says homosexuality is a sin condemed by death Mar 18, 2007 3:20:43 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: basically, you're going to hell if you're gay Mar 18, 2007 3:20:48 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: and it also says marraige is a union between man and woman Mar 18, 2007 3:21:05 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: but homosexuality is not something you choose Mar 18, 2007 3:21:07 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i think that brings up Rocketships's point again Mar 18, 2007 3:21:22 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: so gay people are condemned to hell just for being gay? Mar 18, 2007 3:21:29 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: its okay for marriage under state Mar 18, 2007 3:21:39 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but then it becomes more difficult if you talk about it within the Church Mar 18, 2007 3:22:10 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: who cares about the church Mar 18, 2007 3:22:20 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: the people who belong to it Mar 18, 2007 3:22:33 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: according to the Bible yes, I mean I am religious and I"m not saying I'm against homosexuality, but if you're going about it on BIblical terms and why it's such a huge issue in society then yes Mar 18, 2007 3:22:50 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i think prejudice is even more of an issue in our society Mar 18, 2007 3:23:11 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: laws against certain kinds of marriage aren't new Mar 18, 2007 3:23:28 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: for example? Mar 18, 2007 3:23:45 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: there used to be laws against marriage between blacks and whites Mar 18, 2007 3:23:51 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: ok Mar 18, 2007 3:24:06 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: there's still a lot of prejudice present against that today Mar 18, 2007 3:24:07 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i agree Mar 18, 2007 3:24:13 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: What I do no understand is how gay people can be condemned to hell, yet made in the image and likeness of this good God Mar 18, 2007 3:24:20 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and i think its a similar isuue with gay marriage Mar 18, 2007 3:24:23 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well technically, you're condemned to hell for any sin, but we aren't really here to talk about salvation and repentence, etc Mar 18, 2007 3:25:09 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: No true Mar 18, 2007 3:25:17 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Not Mar 18, 2007 3:25:22 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: who is the one who condemns us? Mar 18, 2007 3:25:34 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Jesus says the only sin unforgiveable is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit Mar 18, 2007 3:25:40 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Others are foregiven with the chance for salvation Mar 18, 2007 3:25:50 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah but you have to ask for forgiveness Mar 18, 2007 3:26:12 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I don't think the Church will ever allow gay marriage, at least, I don't think the Catholic Church will, but i thin, the more important issue is gay marriage in a legal sense Mar 18, 2007 3:26:40 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Ok, so why can't you ask for foregiveness then Mar 18, 2007 3:26:52 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: which is still not allowed throughout most of the country Mar 18, 2007 3:27:02 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: you can Mar 18, 2007 3:27:03 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: In a legal sense, it should be allowed Mar 18, 2007 3:27:10 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i didn't say you couldn't Mar 18, 2007 3:27:15 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: THen I do not understand your previous point. Mar 18, 2007 3:27:27 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: How they are condemned to Hell. Mar 18, 2007 3:27:34 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: It's not blasphemy against the Holy Spirit Mar 18, 2007 3:27:42 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well you can't ask for forgiveness then keep doing what you're doing i guess i mean maybe you can be gay and not act on those feelings and therefore you wouldn't be sinning Mar 18, 2007 3:28:16 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Exactly Mar 18, 2007 3:28:26 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: and I believe the Church supports that Mar 18, 2007 3:28:30 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: I do too Mar 18, 2007 3:28:35 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: as long as their is some motive not to act upon it Mar 18, 2007 3:28:37 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: that is the view of the Church Mar 18, 2007 3:28:39 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Right, outside the church, it should be completely legal - to act on and everything Mar 18, 2007 3:28:52 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but why do you think that it isn't legal yet? Mar 18, 2007 3:28:59 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: because of prejudices Mar 18, 2007 3:29:08 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: A traditional society is still catching up Mar 18, 2007 3:29:11 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Same reason slavery was not abolished over night Mar 18, 2007 3:29:25 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: and because the union is only allowed in 3 states not in every state Mar 18, 2007 3:29:31 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: hmm, i think we're all on the same page then about gay marriage under the state Mar 18, 2007 3:30:14 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Indeed Mar 18, 2007 3:30:19 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah Mar 18, 2007 3:30:25 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: what do you think of the people who say homosexuality is a choice? Mar 18, 2007 3:30:57 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Disagree Mar 18, 2007 3:31:06 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I am no scientist, but hear it is part of the genetical code Mar 18, 2007 3:31:16 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: as do I Mar 18, 2007 3:31:18 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: yeah, should we restrict people for having red hair? Mar 18, 2007 3:31:36 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Precisely Mar 18, 2007 3:31:45 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: of course not, because its genetic Mar 18, 2007 3:31:47 PM EDT
[Roberta Sabin joined the session] Mar 18, 2007 3:32:05 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: This all leads me back to my question about why the church could condemn it - if we are all "made in the image and likeness of a good God", how can these people be sinning. Perhaps we are really sinning for not accepting them in the Church. Mar 18, 2007 3:32:23 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i think that hit the nail on teh head Mar 18, 2007 3:32:41 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: that's an interesting way of looking at it Mar 18, 2007 3:32:49 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Thanks, any insight? Mar 18, 2007 3:32:56 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I am truly clueless on that point Mar 18, 2007 3:33:13 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: yes, janada and klutzo, what are your feelings Mar 18, 2007 3:33:25 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: perhaps if the Church was more more open and accepting, there wouldn't be such scandal Mar 18, 2007 3:33:31 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: with the sexual abuse of young boys i mean Mar 18, 2007 3:33:42 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Definitely, with the same moral tradition, but allow this open sexuality Mar 18, 2007 3:33:53 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: yeah thats a strange correlation Mar 18, 2007 3:34:04 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well i know a lot of churches do a sort of "gay therapy" trying to turn people straight, which i'm not sure i agree with Mar 18, 2007 3:34:24 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well the little boy scandal is a scandal because they were little boys... Mar 18, 2007 3:34:44 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: and they cant do it - because its something youre born with Mar 18, 2007 3:34:45 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yes, especially if evidence is true that it is a piece of our genetic make-up Mar 18, 2007 3:34:45 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: it would be like therapy for read hair as mntbike would say Mar 18, 2007 3:34:59 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: well everything about us is a combination of genetics and culture Mar 18, 2007 3:35:22 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Can you explain that Mar 18, 2007 3:35:37 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: what do you mean? Mar 18, 2007 3:35:37 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: We're a product of the interaction between our genes and our environment Mar 18, 2007 3:36:01 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: to a certain extent Mar 18, 2007 3:36:18 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: nature vs nurture Mar 18, 2007 3:36:22 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I can agree with that Mar 18, 2007 3:36:26 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: like the language we speak Mar 18, 2007 3:36:29 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: but why would someone choose to be gay and face all the hardships they have to face? Mar 18, 2007 3:37:01 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: well, some try to hide it... but i think we were in agreement that someones doesn't choose to be gay Mar 18, 2007 3:37:32 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yes Mar 18, 2007 3:37:40 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: does anybody have any gay relatives? Mar 18, 2007 3:37:57 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i have a gay uncle Mar 18, 2007 3:38:04 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: No sir Mar 18, 2007 3:38:06 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: no, but I have gay friends Mar 18, 2007 3:38:08 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yea, friends, though Mar 18, 2007 3:38:15 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: but at the same time you weren't born thinking homosexuality was okay, that's a product of the way you were raised and maybe having gay friends, so at the same time some people were raised to think it's wrong Mar 18, 2007 3:38:41 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah ihave gay friends Mar 18, 2007 3:38:50 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: what does everyone think about what janada just said Mar 18, 2007 3:39:29 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i dont really understand Mar 18, 2007 3:39:49 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: well, definitely, prejudice is taught Mar 18, 2007 3:39:55 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I can see that how you were brought up can make you think it's right or wrong, but as you grow older you should wrestle with the idea in a more intellectual manner Mar 18, 2007 3:40:19 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Much, again, like the idea of slavery Mar 18, 2007 3:40:39 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what's your opinion about children being raised by a gay couple? Mar 18, 2007 3:41:31 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i thinks its ok Mar 18, 2007 3:41:39 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I do not see any problem with it Mar 18, 2007 3:41:42 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: The rich part of life is diversity, who says we should all have a "perfect" mother/father bringing up Mar 18, 2007 3:42:05 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: it's kind of like being raised by a single parent Mar 18, 2007 3:42:09 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: How so? Mar 18, 2007 3:42:18 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well just how being raised by only your mom, you don't have a father figure in your life Mar 18, 2007 3:43:05 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: if you're raised by two moms it's kind of the same thing Mar 18, 2007 3:43:18 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: kina Mar 18, 2007 3:43:27 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: kinda* Mar 18, 2007 3:43:34 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: In that sense maybe yes, but who says that is the ultimate way to be raised. You can have the same loving collaboration from same sex parents Mar 18, 2007 3:43:46 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: what does everyone think about that Mar 18, 2007 3:44:11 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: most straight marriages end in divorce anyway Mar 18, 2007 3:44:14 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: agree/disagree? Mar 18, 2007 3:44:16 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i'm not saying it's a bad thing, like being raised by one parent doesnt make your home life a less loving one Mar 18, 2007 3:44:18 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: maybe if gays were allowed to marry, that rate might go down, who knows Mar 18, 2007 3:44:45 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I think so Mar 18, 2007 3:44:55 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: right, because they have to go through so much to get married Mar 18, 2007 3:45:06 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: people talk about protecting the sanctity of marriage when they oppose gay marriage, but to be honest, i don't really see that much sanctity left anyway Mar 18, 2007 3:45:12 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: the way people treat it these days Mar 18, 2007 3:45:25 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: yeah, thats just the church talking Mar 18, 2007 3:45:38 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well going back to the divorce comment, there are a lot of couples that just live together for years and as soon as they get married it ends in divorce, could the same be possible for a gay couple? Mar 18, 2007 3:45:39 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: sure its possible Mar 18, 2007 3:45:55 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: just not as likely Mar 18, 2007 3:46:02 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: we won't know unless they're allowed to get married Mar 18, 2007 3:46:04 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: why is that? Mar 18, 2007 3:46:07 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: you can't predict the future Mar 18, 2007 3:46:18 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: the point is they should be given the same chance as straight people Mar 18, 2007 3:46:37 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I read an interesting article the other day that too many people go in to marriage expecting to always feel the same feelings they had at the beginning for the rest of their marriage. That is seems to set the marriage to doom as feelings are a fleeting thing. Perhaps if more people cherished the actual bond and search for ideals beyond feelings the rate would come down. Mar 18, 2007 3:46:39 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: maybe there is just something about the perception of marriage that's gone ary Mar 18, 2007 3:46:52 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what do you mean? Mar 18, 2007 3:47:15 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I think it's that ^ Mar 18, 2007 3:47:19 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Me? Mar 18, 2007 3:47:22 PM EDT
Roberta Sabin: I've just been evesdropping--it looks like it's going great! I'll sign off--but I've got to say that marriage is GREAT! I've had 1 main squeeze for 28 years! I hope you are as lucky--or blessed. Mar 18, 2007 3:47:25 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: haha Mar 18, 2007 3:47:37 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: lol Mar 18, 2007 3:47:38 PM EDT
[Roberta Sabin left the session] Mar 18, 2007 3:47:42 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: glad to hear it Mar 18, 2007 3:47:42 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: haha thanks Mar 18, 2007 3:47:44 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: but yeah what i said relates to rocket ship's comment Mar 18, 2007 3:48:00 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: wait, what? i'm sorry, what do you mean? Mar 18, 2007 3:48:10 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i think people just have false expectations of marriage Mar 18, 2007 3:48:12 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: oh okay Mar 18, 2007 3:48:16 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Let me clarify Mar 18, 2007 3:48:18 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: they don't understand the commitment Mar 18, 2007 3:48:34 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i agree Mar 18, 2007 3:48:50 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: there is an initial feeling which we call love, people expect that to last throughout marriage even though feelings are a fleeting experience. We have to find something beyond that feeling of "love". Love seems to be ill-defined Mar 18, 2007 3:48:53 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i agree, love is a choice not a feeling Mar 18, 2007 3:49:29 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: There are certainly feelings associated with it Mar 18, 2007 3:49:51 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but how can you base a life-long relationship on feelings Mar 18, 2007 3:49:58 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Feelings are not lasting Mar 18, 2007 3:50:03 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well yeah love is a feeling, but ultimately you choose whether or not that is going to be the person you are going to love and spend your life with Mar 18, 2007 3:50:39 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: mtnbike-any thoughts? Mar 18, 2007 3:50:44 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: True Mar 18, 2007 3:51:05 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i dontbthink any of us can really know until we're married Mar 18, 2007 3:51:30 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: how do you all feel about an amendment to ban gay marriage? Mar 18, 2007 3:51:36 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Ridiculous Mar 18, 2007 3:51:51 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i think its absurd Mar 18, 2007 3:51:53 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i think that would just end in chaos Mar 18, 2007 3:51:54 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i think it would be a step backward Mar 18, 2007 3:51:55 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: A government is supposed to support the interests of its people, not stand in the way Mar 18, 2007 3:52:03 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i'm glad it wasn't successful Mar 18, 2007 3:52:08 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: It's not like the citizens are asking to carry around bazookas Mar 18, 2007 3:52:14 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: thats the religious element in this country Mar 18, 2007 3:52:23 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Which should be separated from the State Mar 18, 2007 3:52:34 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: yes Mar 18, 2007 3:52:43 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i don't think that banning gay marriage is something that Bush should be concerned with at the moment Mar 18, 2007 3:53:33 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah and the gov't doesn't really have any valid reasons to ban it besides religious ones Mar 18, 2007 3:53:36 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I think that he has bigger problems Mar 18, 2007 3:53:41 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: that he should deal with Mar 18, 2007 3:53:45 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: that's true Mar 18, 2007 3:53:46 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: All true Mar 18, 2007 3:53:51 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: it seems to be based on religious sentiments Mar 18, 2007 3:53:59 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: not logical ones Mar 18, 2007 3:54:01 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Not to say they can't be one in the same at times Mar 18, 2007 3:54:07 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: just not frequently Mar 18, 2007 3:54:27 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I think one of the big problems with this issue is the legal disadvantages faced by gay couples Mar 18, 2007 3:55:04 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: could you explain? Mar 18, 2007 3:55:25 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: for example, gay people aren't allowed spousal confidentiality during a trial Mar 18, 2007 3:55:48 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and problems arise when trying to adopt children Mar 18, 2007 3:56:01 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: True, and instead of putting the work into correcting those issues, the government wants an amendment to simplify things Mar 18, 2007 3:56:30 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: simplify things how? Mar 18, 2007 3:58:55 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: They would not have to deal with the legal issues discussed by Klutzo, because a ban would be in place Mar 18, 2007 3:59:09 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: What are other countries' positions on gay marriage? Mar 18, 2007 3:59:21 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: good question Mar 18, 2007 3:59:36 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i have no idea, lol Mar 18, 2007 3:59:42 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I am not entirely sure, but I would say many are much further behind us Mar 18, 2007 3:59:43 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i feel like europe is probably much more open Mar 18, 2007 3:59:49 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: True Mar 18, 2007 3:59:53 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: europe is more open about everything though Mar 18, 2007 4:00:03 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but when you get to some of the far eastern cultures with deeper traditions, it seems like it would be further behind us Mar 18, 2007 4:00:17 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: definitely Mar 18, 2007 4:00:27 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: where there are still arranged marriages and stuff like that Mar 18, 2007 4:00:39 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: a country like japan would frown on gay marriage Mar 18, 2007 4:00:45 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: oh i don't think gay marriage is even a possibility in places like that Mar 18, 2007 4:00:46 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: true Mar 18, 2007 4:00:59 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: so do you all agree with the states legallizing gay marriage? Mar 18, 2007 4:02:34 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yes Mar 18, 2007 4:02:40 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yes Mar 18, 2007 4:02:41 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: absolutely Mar 18, 2007 4:02:47 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah Mar 18, 2007 4:02:49 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: expand! Mar 18, 2007 4:02:57 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: :) Mar 18, 2007 4:02:59 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i think we've exhausted the issue Mar 18, 2007 4:03:11 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I think all of our points up until now support that: there is a separation a state and church, genetic makeup, etc... Mar 18, 2007 4:03:24 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: i know, you guys are doing great.... I just need a little more thoughts on the topic Mar 18, 2007 4:03:32 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Government is to support the interests of the people, not crush them Mar 18, 2007 4:03:53 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but then again, the interests of some people are against gay marriage Mar 18, 2007 4:04:09 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: So were some against slavery Mar 18, 2007 4:04:23 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: hopefully moral righteousness wins out Mar 18, 2007 4:04:30 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i think there are a lot more gay people than we think Mar 18, 2007 4:04:31 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: which is why the state should choose whether or not to legalize it and not the national gov't Mar 18, 2007 4:04:37 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: what is it like 1 in 8? Mar 18, 2007 4:04:38 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i don't really know the statistics Mar 18, 2007 4:04:53 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but ultimately, I don't see much difference from bans against marriage between African Americans and whites, I think prejudice plays a big part in people Mar 18, 2007 4:05:42 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: people's opposition Mar 18, 2007 4:05:49 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Absolutely Mar 18, 2007 4:06:00 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: and i dont think that prejudice will ever completely disappear Mar 18, 2007 4:06:21 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: People used to argue that it would be difficult for mulatto children to fit into society Mar 18, 2007 4:06:24 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Part of it, as has be discussed, is a mixing of Church beliefs and State Mar 18, 2007 4:06:26 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: like people now argue that it will be hard for the children of gay people to fit into society Mar 18, 2007 4:06:41 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i think that just shows that we need to change our society Mar 18, 2007 4:06:49 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well i mean i think there is a little bit of a difference between not being allowed to get married and being forced ot do manual labor at the crack of a whip Mar 18, 2007 4:06:57 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: oh, i wasn Mar 18, 2007 4:07:19 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: ah, sorry Mar 18, 2007 4:07:23 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i wasn't talking about slavery Mar 18, 2007 4:07:36 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: just blacks and whites not being allowed to marry Mar 18, 2007 4:07:50 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: haha okay Mar 18, 2007 4:08:00 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: OK does everyone want to give a final thought on the topic? Mar 18, 2007 4:08:21 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: gays should be given teh same rights as straight people Mar 18, 2007 4:08:46 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: Gay marriage should be legalized, an amendment banning gay marriage would be a deprivation of their rights Mar 18, 2007 4:09:12 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: My final thought is that gay marriage should eventually be legalized internationally, but to get there we need a state-by-state or country-by-country drive to legalize it. It is part of our natural genetic make up and should not rely on the interests of any religion Mar 18, 2007 4:09:14 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: people are different - there's no way around it Mar 18, 2007 4:09:23 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: it's going to take time, prejudice still exists in everything, even the things we've legalized, it's not really going to be enough to just change a law Mar 18, 2007 4:09:48 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yes, society needs to change Mar 18, 2007 4:10:03 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: But a law is a step in the right direction, atleast they will have their rights Mar 18, 2007 4:10:10 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: true Mar 18, 2007 4:10:19 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: OK I think we can stop here Mar 18, 2007 4:10:34 PM EDT
