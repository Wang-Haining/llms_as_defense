Nicole Becker: Your first topic is the catholic church Apr 17, 2007 7:20:10 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: The pope recently issued an apostolic exhortation reaffirming that priests should be celibate men. He also reminded all that divorced and remarried Catholics should not receive Communion. Thoughts? Apr 17, 2007 7:20:31 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: anybody? Apr 17, 2007 7:21:08 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: well Apr 17, 2007 7:21:12 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: hey nicole i will be leaving at random parts becuz im at gospel choir practice becuz we have a concert on saturday Apr 17, 2007 7:21:13 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: okay Apr 17, 2007 7:21:21 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well, i think that if people have an annulment they should still be able to have communion Apr 17, 2007 7:21:45 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i dont kno if i believe that Apr 17, 2007 7:21:50 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: the catholic church has so many rules Apr 17, 2007 7:22:01 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: yeah that part of the exhortation really surprised me Apr 17, 2007 7:22:04 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: so basically if ppl dont make any mistakes in there life is the only way they will receive communion Apr 17, 2007 7:22:26 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: like, what if you could not get an annulment for some reason, but needed to get out of an abusive maragie or something Apr 17, 2007 7:22:32 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: the church doesnt care Apr 17, 2007 7:22:43 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: they cant accept that some times divorce really is the better option Apr 17, 2007 7:23:19 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i feel like that is just a reall loose rull though....like they dont go around saying....."the body of christ...oh by they way if ur a divorsee you cant eat this...." Apr 17, 2007 7:23:46 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: well how would they tell unless you made it known Apr 17, 2007 7:24:15 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah, so like i said...i feel as if the rull is really inaffective Apr 17, 2007 7:24:36 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i mean if you didnt get remarried in the same church, they have no way of knowing Apr 17, 2007 7:24:36 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: they should start giving out stickers to divorced people Apr 17, 2007 7:24:43 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: haha Apr 17, 2007 7:24:50 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well there goes half the congrigation Apr 17, 2007 7:25:00 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: u saying the catholic church should give out stickers Apr 17, 2007 7:25:13 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: half the congregation is right Apr 17, 2007 7:25:21 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: a major problem with the catholic church its inability to deal with the issues of our age Apr 17, 2007 7:25:42 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: like i understand that they dont feel as if people sould get divorceed, so that is why they made up the annulment process if the case is really neceissary Apr 17, 2007 7:25:56 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: they cant accept progressivism because theyre so rooted in tradition Apr 17, 2007 7:26:10 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: they are Apr 17, 2007 7:26:30 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: and therefore cant effectively deal with issues like divorce or contraceptives Apr 17, 2007 7:26:35 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: thats why you dont see alot of young people stayin active in the catholic church Apr 17, 2007 7:26:58 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: and in the meantime theyre just losing more and more churchgoers Apr 17, 2007 7:27:06 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: yea Apr 17, 2007 7:27:13 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: but i do understand that a lot of the reason why people get divorced is b/c they decided to get married too soon in life when they "meet the one....like they have not really dated that person long enough to relaly know what they are like through all circumstances....so like they are trying to prevent that i guess Apr 17, 2007 7:27:26 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: of course theyre picking up copious amounts of churchgoers abroad Apr 17, 2007 7:27:35 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i understand what they are trying to do, and the stance they take isnt wrong, but its not effective or an absolute Apr 17, 2007 7:28:05 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yaeh Apr 17, 2007 7:28:13 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: heres a big question Apr 17, 2007 7:28:36 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: actually...i find that a lot of places abroad (aka europe) are not that church going eithe Apr 17, 2007 7:29:00 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: if god is the ultimate judgement, why is the church allowed to decide which sinners can take communion and accept the blood and body of jesus christ? Apr 17, 2007 7:29:16 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: no idea Apr 17, 2007 7:29:32 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: its not the popes place to say Apr 17, 2007 7:29:32 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: amen Apr 17, 2007 7:29:48 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: well thats all the church does Apr 17, 2007 7:29:49 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i kno Apr 17, 2007 7:29:50 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: good point Apr 17, 2007 7:29:53 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i agree with that Apr 17, 2007 7:30:03 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: he can take a stance on it, but he cant condemn a certain group of sinners just because Apr 17, 2007 7:30:05 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah, in the end it is God who does the determining in the church Apr 17, 2007 7:30:30 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: so like i said,....i feel as if the rule is just kinda there, but not really ever followed Apr 17, 2007 7:31:09 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: wen it gets to god, though, the church doesnt matter anymore Apr 17, 2007 7:31:22 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: now if its something like celibate male priests, thats something that i think the pope has authority over Apr 17, 2007 7:31:23 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah, cause that is a person made judgment Apr 17, 2007 7:31:54 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i might disagree, but its not my place to undermine the popes decision Apr 17, 2007 7:32:03 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: like....we made that rule up to begine with, it was not always that way Apr 17, 2007 7:32:08 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: ? Apr 17, 2007 7:32:38 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: are there any "person made" rules you think the church needs to change? Apr 17, 2007 7:32:43 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: like i understand that they say that so that the priest can just focus on the church....cause it is hard to have a family and be there for them all the time but also be availible to all the church congrigation Apr 17, 2007 7:33:11 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: wich is why they made the rule in the first place way back when Apr 17, 2007 7:33:36 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: i feel like its not the churchs place to have any say in matters outside the church Apr 17, 2007 7:34:13 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: thats true Apr 17, 2007 7:34:27 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: but...i am not sure....i feel as if there could allow decans to marry and give out communion and wine and do the other sacraments (cause right now they cant do all of that stuff) Apr 17, 2007 7:34:28 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: government Apr 17, 2007 7:34:31 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: like they can marry Apr 17, 2007 7:34:56 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: but then they cant do all of the other stuff...that is reserved for the "celebrate priest" Apr 17, 2007 7:35:17 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: now i know we have deacons in my church, but what role do they play in the catholic church? Apr 17, 2007 7:35:21 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: none Apr 17, 2007 7:35:41 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: theyre local Apr 17, 2007 7:35:44 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: ok Apr 17, 2007 7:35:50 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: basically they can do everything a priest does but the sacramenst i think Apr 17, 2007 7:36:06 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: how do you feel about the fact that only males can be priests, etc/ Apr 17, 2007 7:36:26 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i feel as if femals should be allowed to be priests Apr 17, 2007 7:36:55 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i dont have an opinoin on that Apr 17, 2007 7:37:01 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: i dont see why not Apr 17, 2007 7:37:03 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: well im episcopalian so i we have females Apr 17, 2007 7:37:17 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: why? Apr 17, 2007 7:37:18 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: priests Apr 17, 2007 7:37:25 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i honestly dont care, but i would argue that females should not be allowed to be priests Apr 17, 2007 7:37:26 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: why not??? Apr 17, 2007 7:37:33 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: because if i didnt, no one would be arguing Apr 17, 2007 7:37:51 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: as long as they have to be celibate like men, wuts the difference Apr 17, 2007 7:38:03 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i would say that since eve committed the original sin and caused adam to sin too, we shouldnt let them in positions of power anymore Apr 17, 2007 7:38:27 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: lol Apr 17, 2007 7:38:56 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: haha Apr 17, 2007 7:39:01 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: also Apr 17, 2007 7:39:11 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: women have wombs Apr 17, 2007 7:39:15 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: which are for having babies Apr 17, 2007 7:39:23 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: oh let me tell you wombs are scary Apr 17, 2007 7:39:31 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: how can they have babies if theyre celibate Apr 17, 2007 7:39:32 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: lol Apr 17, 2007 7:39:32 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: not have sex Apr 17, 2007 7:39:48 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: well the men cant have children either Apr 17, 2007 7:40:11 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: with women obviously Apr 17, 2007 7:40:22 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: ok, so for ur little argument sake (thanks for taking the other side by the way) but adam could have refused the "apple" so he sined just as much as eve did...she just did if first Apr 17, 2007 7:40:37 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: i say we stick to the topic Apr 17, 2007 7:41:04 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: lol Apr 17, 2007 7:41:05 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: yeah but if she wasnt there egging him on, he would have never sinned Apr 17, 2007 7:41:12 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: but they both sinned...he could have refused Apr 17, 2007 7:41:17 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: then he is weak!!! Apr 17, 2007 7:41:21 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: and the weak shall inherit the earth Apr 17, 2007 7:41:33 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: or maybe women are manipulative and greedy and therefore would abuse the powers of priesthood Apr 17, 2007 7:41:43 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well i guess that is true...man did inherit the earth Apr 17, 2007 7:42:01 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: at least u admit it Apr 17, 2007 7:42:17 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: lol Apr 17, 2007 7:42:18 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: lol Apr 17, 2007 7:42:33 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: why would they be any more manipulative and greedy then men? Apr 17, 2007 7:42:34 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: basically women are on earth to a) serve men and b) have babies Apr 17, 2007 7:42:37 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i mean men as in humans...not the sex Apr 17, 2007 7:42:43 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: human nature Apr 17, 2007 7:43:05 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: would not tell that to ur girl friend now...she might not be with you for too much longer Apr 17, 2007 7:43:12 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (make sure we're staying on topic...) Apr 17, 2007 7:43:15 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: lol!!!! Apr 17, 2007 7:43:26 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: wow thats so extreme Apr 17, 2007 7:43:32 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: ok so women as priests Apr 17, 2007 7:44:09 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: would someone prove to me that women should be allowed to be priests Apr 17, 2007 7:44:10 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: cuz im not seeing any evidence Apr 17, 2007 7:44:18 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well....lets see Apr 17, 2007 7:44:24 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: they are humans Apr 17, 2007 7:44:30 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: its not like the male priests are gettin along so well Apr 17, 2007 7:44:38 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and thus have civil liberties Apr 17, 2007 7:44:39 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and civil rights Apr 17, 2007 7:44:48 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and who is to say that they can go to church and have the church represent them if they can be apart of the church Apr 17, 2007 7:45:11 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: kinda like how women were taxed b/f they got the vote Apr 17, 2007 7:45:22 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: civil liberties are laws allowed by government, not by church Apr 17, 2007 7:45:35 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: they had to pay taxes but had men be their spokes persons Apr 17, 2007 7:45:47 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i agree they should be equal in the eyes of law, but by the church? Apr 17, 2007 7:45:57 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: its completely separate Apr 17, 2007 7:46:08 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: ignoring the aspect that one is a govt and one is a church for a moment....in each case men were the ones that represented them Apr 17, 2007 7:46:52 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: now in order to be equal Apr 17, 2007 7:46:58 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: should they not have a chance to represent themselves Apr 17, 2007 7:47:07 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: its seperate...but we are both humans whose to say that women dont recieve the same messages of christ that men do Apr 17, 2007 7:47:10 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: the church does not change its policies though Apr 17, 2007 7:47:20 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: well rarely anyway Apr 17, 2007 7:47:25 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i think the bible has different messages for women and men Apr 17, 2007 7:47:40 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: tru Apr 17, 2007 7:48:05 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: so basicaly this could be one of those "rare cases" where the church does change Apr 17, 2007 7:48:10 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: yea Apr 17, 2007 7:48:17 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: but the church has alot of changes to do...becuz i believe its still stuck in the older times Apr 17, 2007 7:48:39 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well..yes and no,....the over all messages are the same for both sexes, but ones that deal with a specific gender usu. have a reason for doing so Apr 17, 2007 7:48:41 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah...i feel that when we get a new pope...cause i doubt this one will live for very long,...i feel as if the church will go more modern Apr 17, 2007 7:49:19 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: cause this guy is still from WWII Apr 17, 2007 7:49:27 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: well theres a reason for everything Apr 17, 2007 7:49:27 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: our grandparents who are old fashion Apr 17, 2007 7:49:40 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: i feel like the church just has no pressure on it to change Apr 17, 2007 7:50:10 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: so once we get a young, dashing, hunk of a pope--maybe theyll start to change Apr 17, 2007 7:50:24 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: haha Apr 17, 2007 7:50:30 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: it basically seems like a complete monarchy Apr 17, 2007 7:50:50 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: the pope says wut goes Apr 17, 2007 7:50:55 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah...i feel as if that is not always right Apr 17, 2007 7:51:14 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: u have to realize its not a democracy Apr 17, 2007 7:51:17 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: what reassurance do you have that a new pope (elected remember, by a group of really old priests stuck in the old ways) will change things? Apr 17, 2007 7:51:29 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: thats all im saying Apr 17, 2007 7:51:31 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well..they have had two very old priest already Apr 17, 2007 7:51:53 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and i feel as if they will next want one who is "fresh" and thus will have newer views Apr 17, 2007 7:52:09 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: no they want Apr 17, 2007 7:52:17 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: wont Apr 17, 2007 7:52:19 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and also a lot of those old priest who elect Apr 17, 2007 7:52:25 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: will be dead prob Apr 17, 2007 7:52:30 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: they like being stuck in the old ways Apr 17, 2007 7:52:34 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: so they will be more modern too Apr 17, 2007 7:52:36 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: they like being "old-fashioned" because that means they still have all the power Apr 17, 2007 7:52:55 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: but i really feel as if a modern twist is going to come soon Apr 17, 2007 7:53:20 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: good luck dreaming Apr 17, 2007 7:53:42 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: lol Apr 17, 2007 7:54:12 PM EDT

CMC frankie27: yes it seems more destructive than anything Apr 17, 2007 7:56:58 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: its long been my opinion that abstinence policy doesnt work Apr 17, 2007 7:57:00 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: its not realistic Apr 17, 2007 7:57:19 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: condoms are Apr 17, 2007 7:57:24 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: but the church is not Apr 17, 2007 7:57:29 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: its the same with drug policy...a policy of zero tolerance never works ever Apr 17, 2007 7:58:17 PM EDT
