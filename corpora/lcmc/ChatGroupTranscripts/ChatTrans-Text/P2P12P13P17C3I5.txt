Nicole Becker: your first topic is the war in iraq Apr 18, 2007 8:32:32 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: anything specific about it? Apr 18, 2007 8:32:58 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: as in, should we pull out, or stay? Apr 18, 2007 8:33:13 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: The Senate has been debating setting a deadline for our pull out. Also the prez says he's sending 2400-3000 additional troops (that on top of the 27000 authorized). Apr 18, 2007 8:33:20 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: there's a little update on what's going on... so, thoughts? Apr 18, 2007 8:33:32 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i think there are already more than enough troops Apr 18, 2007 8:34:03 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yes i completely agree with that statement Apr 18, 2007 8:34:21 PM EDT
CMC rocks: they don't really seem to be getting anything accomplished Apr 18, 2007 8:34:27 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: and disagree with the sending of more troops Apr 18, 2007 8:34:28 PM EDT
CMC rocks: me too Apr 18, 2007 8:34:36 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: i agre Apr 18, 2007 8:35:05 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: e Apr 18, 2007 8:35:06 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: sorry Apr 18, 2007 8:35:08 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i saw this thing on the news back when bush announced that he was sending over more people...... Apr 18, 2007 8:35:12 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: they had people watching his speech and rating how they felt about each thing that he was saying Apr 18, 2007 8:35:33 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: ah Apr 18, 2007 8:35:44 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: and when he announced that, everyone's ratings went down, supporters and opponents of the war Apr 18, 2007 8:36:00 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I just got here, didn't realize we were starting. Apr 18, 2007 8:36:51 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i think there's a problem with our government if it keeps doing things that its people do not support, and only the president does Apr 18, 2007 8:36:56 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well the country was divided about half and half in support for the war at some point, right? Apr 18, 2007 8:37:40 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: at some point, yes Apr 18, 2007 8:37:53 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah, it's supposed to be a democracy, but when the president acts against the people and even his own members, there is a problem Apr 18, 2007 8:37:57 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but not anymore Apr 18, 2007 8:38:04 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i think that those stats have changed by now Apr 18, 2007 8:38:11 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: But we are there now. I feel like if we pull out, the situation will get even worse. Apr 18, 2007 8:39:14 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Right, well that's one of the debates. Apr 18, 2007 8:39:27 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i definitely feel that bush played off of the fear of 9/11 and exploited that to some extend in iraq, which was unconnected Apr 18, 2007 8:39:41 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: For what reason? Oil? Apr 18, 2007 8:40:47 PM EDT
CMC rocks: could you explain that clockwatcher? Apr 18, 2007 8:40:57 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: well i think the war in afghanistan was justified....after 9/11, we had to do something Apr 18, 2007 8:41:54 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but then bush's whole idea about why we should go into iraq was because of weapons o fmass destruction (which were never found) and people were more willing to accept bush' plan because of what had just happened in 9/11 Apr 18, 2007 8:43:00 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: do you think iraq was reasonable for reasons of WMDs Apr 18, 2007 8:43:01 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I think so. Apr 18, 2007 8:43:10 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: terrorism fears were heightened, and that helped bush gain more supporters...i think .that's what i meant Apr 18, 2007 8:43:38 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i dont thind WMD are ever a good idea Apr 18, 2007 8:43:40 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but there was no concrete evidence of WMD Apr 18, 2007 8:44:17 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: How do we know what intelligence the government may have had, though? Apr 18, 2007 8:44:38 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: About WMDs Apr 18, 2007 8:44:45 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: this is true Apr 18, 2007 8:45:10 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: and then there are the weapons inspections to consider Apr 18, 2007 8:45:15 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Also, I don't understand why it is such a surprise that we didn't find any there. I'm sure Hussein had thousands of depots, any of which could have had WMDs. Right when we were invading, he just had to give the order to move them out of the country. Apr 18, 2007 8:45:42 PM EDT
CMC rocks: Well, we could have been operating under the idea that the removal might not have happpened. Apr 18, 2007 8:46:36 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Right after the invasion, the media was making such a big deal about how we hadn't found any. Yet with the amount of man power we had in Iraq, it was probably physically impossible to search every single depot. Apr 18, 2007 8:47:11 PM EDT
CMC rocks: that's true Apr 18, 2007 8:47:32 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: right Apr 18, 2007 8:47:42 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: agreed Apr 18, 2007 8:47:56 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: So I don't think we went in for wrong reasons. Hey, no WMDs went off since then. :) Apr 18, 2007 8:48:26 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i'm just saying that if 9/11 HADN"T happened, i don't feel that there would have been nearly as many supporters originally Apr 18, 2007 8:49:02 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Of course Apr 18, 2007 8:49:11 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: oh, absolutely Apr 18, 2007 8:49:17 PM EDT
CMC rocks: How do you guys feel about our continued presence there? Apr 18, 2007 8:49:23 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: well i think that since we've started something, we have a responsibility to finish it Apr 18, 2007 8:49:46 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but i'd like to get out of there soon Apr 18, 2007 8:49:55 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: *as soon as possible Apr 18, 2007 8:50:03 PM EDT
CMC rocks: by finish it, would that include sending more troops? Apr 18, 2007 8:50:17 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I think we have gotten ourselves into a bad situation. If we stay, the country is torn apart over here, we keep losing people over there, and the mission is going nowhere. If we pull out, the situation will only get worse. Apr 18, 2007 8:50:22 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i think by staying too long it could also get worse than if we just pull out Apr 18, 2007 8:51:13 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: right, so the extremes dont work Apr 18, 2007 8:51:23 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: how much time do you think it would take Apr 18, 2007 8:51:28 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I think they should lay out some clear-cut objectives and realistic overall goals. Otherwise, if the war is going nowhere, we have to choose the lesser of two eveils and pull out. Apr 18, 2007 8:51:33 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but it's hard to tell when one option becomes worse than the other Apr 18, 2007 8:51:34 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: no i don't think that we should send more troops...we need to wean ourselves out of there so that iraq can become more independent Apr 18, 2007 8:51:50 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but it's a VERY messy situation and i really don't know enough about it to know what our goals should be or how long it should take Apr 18, 2007 8:52:29 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: some say that we're staying for the mere sake of being consistent Apr 18, 2007 8:53:04 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Being consistent? Apr 18, 2007 8:53:32 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: like, to save face Apr 18, 2007 8:53:41 PM EDT
CMC rocks: I think we need to determine SOME goals. Apr 18, 2007 8:53:55 PM EDT
CMC rocks: The main problem I have with the war is that the goals are not clear. Apr 18, 2007 8:54:21 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but they weren't clear from the beginning Apr 18, 2007 8:54:54 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well what are they doing over there right now? Just expanding out and controlling different towns? Apr 18, 2007 8:54:59 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: which is my issue with the start of the war Apr 18, 2007 8:55:03 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i really have no idea goldeneye Apr 18, 2007 8:55:13 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: some have called it modern day colonialism Apr 18, 2007 8:55:23 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: as a simple way to describe it Apr 18, 2007 8:55:37 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: what do you think Apr 18, 2007 8:55:39 PM EDT
CMC rocks: that's an interesting take on it Apr 18, 2007 8:55:39 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Heh Apr 18, 2007 8:55:41 PM EDT
CMC rocks: probably true Apr 18, 2007 8:55:45 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: maybe Apr 18, 2007 8:56:41 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: idk Apr 18, 2007 8:56:43 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: What benefits are we getting from Iraq? We're not actually using the oil yet Apr 18, 2007 8:56:44 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: i'm not entirely sure about the specifics Apr 18, 2007 8:56:57 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Besides the economic benefits of war itself Apr 18, 2007 8:57:10 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well hmm... I guess since we are trying to impose our democracy on them Apr 18, 2007 8:57:54 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: economic BENEFITS? we are increasing the national debt immensely! Apr 18, 2007 8:57:59 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: War stimulates the economy, I thought there were always benefits Apr 18, 2007 8:58:26 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but we don't go in everywhere and try to impose democracy Apr 18, 2007 8:58:37 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well maybe we haven't seen them yet? Apr 18, 2007 8:58:45 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: alright Apr 18, 2007 8:58:53 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: well, i'm not sure, but i think that it's a net loss Apr 18, 2007 8:58:54 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: especially given the casualties Apr 18, 2007 8:59:03 PM EDT
CMC rocks: probably Apr 18, 2007 8:59:05 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: exactly Apr 18, 2007 8:59:08 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: clockwatcher I'm confused... I was trying to say it might be like modern day colonialism since we are imposing democracy on them Apr 18, 2007 8:59:13 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but a lot of places don't have democracy and we don't go imposing democracy everywhere, so why here? there must be another reason for our presence there Apr 18, 2007 9:00:13 PM EDT
CMC rocks: which we were saying is economic Apr 18, 2007 9:00:32 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: So why in Iraq? Apr 18, 2007 9:00:40 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: oh i'm sorry i misunderstood...i thought you were saying that that was a benefit of the war Apr 18, 2007 9:00:43 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Ok Apr 18, 2007 9:01:00 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i was trying to say what rocks just said Apr 18, 2007 9:01:02 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Okay rocks, you're saying there must be some reason for our continued presence there besides democracy? Apr 18, 2007 9:02:56 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: such as? Apr 18, 2007 9:03:04 PM EDT
CMC rocks: oil Apr 18, 2007 9:03:20 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: ah, i thought you were referring to a political goal Apr 18, 2007 9:03:46 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: sorry, misunderstood Apr 18, 2007 9:03:53 PM EDT
CMC rocks: no necessarily Apr 18, 2007 9:03:54 PM EDT
CMC rocks: thats OK Apr 18, 2007 9:03:59 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i forget who mentioned it before, but we're notreally seeing oil benefits yet. maybe that will come later? Apr 18, 2007 9:04:10 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Once its safe enough to take oil out of the country Apr 18, 2007 9:04:29 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah i guess that makes sense that we can't really go taking it now Apr 18, 2007 9:06:37 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: So basically, you guys think we are just staying in Iraq until we can take the oil out, and we don't really care about establishing a democracy there? Apr 18, 2007 9:07:17 PM EDT
CMC rocks: not really Apr 18, 2007 9:07:43 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but i don't really understand.....do you think that they will just GIVE us oil once they are stable? Apr 18, 2007 9:07:56 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: rocks, explain Apr 18, 2007 9:08:28 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: or we are just trying to form a good relationship with them...so that they feel they owe us for helping them out? Apr 18, 2007 9:08:29 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I'm not sure, I never actually thought of that, clock. Apr 18, 2007 9:09:11 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: like everyone cites oil saying that bush just wanted to go into iraq to get oil, but i don't quite understand how that would really play out Apr 18, 2007 9:10:28 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i think we will eventually control them in a way, like imperialism Apr 18, 2007 9:10:32 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but i'd never thought about that much either Apr 18, 2007 9:10:44 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: nor have i Apr 18, 2007 9:10:50 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i'm not really very informed on this Apr 18, 2007 9:11:07 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: it was probably the topic i spoke about the least in my discussion grou Apr 18, 2007 9:12:01 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: group* Apr 18, 2007 9:12:06 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah i don't know much either Apr 18, 2007 9:12:27 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: the general consensus seems to be though, that we went in for the wrong reasons Apr 18, 2007 9:13:27 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: but now that we're there, it doesn't make sense to abruptly just leave Apr 18, 2007 9:13:47 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yes, that's my feeling Apr 18, 2007 9:14:02 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I don't think we can legitimately say we went in for the wrong reasons. Apr 18, 2007 9:14:41 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well i think the problem is we don't exactly know why we got in Apr 18, 2007 9:15:15 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: we haven't even brought up the whole issue about the UN and how we went in without there support Apr 18, 2007 9:16:20 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: how do you guys feel about that? Apr 18, 2007 9:16:27 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: wait, explain what you mean, Goldeneye Apr 18, 2007 9:16:32 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Unless we see every piece of intel the government collected about Iraq and WMDs, we can't make any claims about the legitimacy of our going there. Apr 18, 2007 9:19:17 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Thats how I feel at least. Apr 18, 2007 9:19:25 PM EDT
CMC rocks: it is hard to make an informed decision with all the info Apr 18, 2007 9:20:44 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah Apr 18, 2007 9:23:14 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (last thoughts?) Apr 18, 2007 9:23:57 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: no Apr 18, 2007 9:25:19 PM EDT
CMC rocks: no Apr 18, 2007 9:25:36 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: lol Nope Apr 18, 2007 9:25:43 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: lol no Apr 18, 2007 9:26:08 PM EDT
