Melissa Carbone: denver decided to legalize it in small amounts for persons over 21 Mar 18, 2007 5:06:15 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: thoughts? Mar 18, 2007 5:06:17 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: (me too) i should start this conversation by saying that i do not, in fact, smoke, but it's probably going to sound like i do Mar 18, 2007 5:06:29 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: (sry, in response to John) Mar 18, 2007 5:06:39 PM EDT

CMC John_Bastow: OKKKKKK Mar 18, 2007 5:07:08 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think that it should be legalized Mar 18, 2007 5:07:16 PM EDT
CMC dah88: im not that educated on marijiuana - however i think small amount would be okay - i guess it owuld be just like alcohol Mar 18, 2007 5:07:16 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: so yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:07:17 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: ok, i mean, nobody's name is being used Mar 18, 2007 5:07:39 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: looking at it just from the standpoint of something you smoke, ignoring the other effects, i would say no Mar 18, 2007 5:07:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: has anybody here smoked...nobody say no...just say if you have Mar 18, 2007 5:07:51 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: 3 Mar 18, 2007 5:08:04 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: 2 Mar 18, 2007 5:08:06 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: 1 Mar 18, 2007 5:08:07 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: ok then, i guess none of us are that experienced, lol Mar 18, 2007 5:08:19 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha oh well Mar 18, 2007 5:08:29 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: how about the next one Mar 18, 2007 5:08:39 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: who's been around people who're smoking Mar 18, 2007 5:08:44 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i have... Mar 18, 2007 5:08:46 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: (hand goes up) Mar 18, 2007 5:08:54 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: girls? Mar 18, 2007 5:09:06 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i don't think i have... Mar 18, 2007 5:09:12 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: frankly, high people are way less obnoxious than drunks, in my experience Mar 18, 2007 5:09:25 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: not while they're doing it at least Mar 18, 2007 5:09:26 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, i agree Mar 18, 2007 5:09:39 PM EDT
CMC dah88: the people who i have talked to about it who do smoke - they always say that its not that bad for you and it hasnt been proven to be bad for you - ive been told all my life that it is - whats up with that? Mar 18, 2007 5:09:47 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: umm doesnt smoking of any sort lead to lung cancer? Mar 18, 2007 5:10:05 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well Mar 18, 2007 5:10:05 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i heard smoking pot was worse than cigarettes Mar 18, 2007 5:10:20 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, supposedly it can cause minimal memory loss, but the research on that is debatable Mar 18, 2007 5:10:22 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: and it depends on where you're getting it as to how dangerous it is Mar 18, 2007 5:10:34 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i heard that cigs are worse Mar 18, 2007 5:10:37 PM EDT
CMC dah88: ive never heard that (about cigarettes) Mar 18, 2007 5:10:44 PM EDT
CMC dah88: same Mar 18, 2007 5:10:45 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: pure pot is not nearly as bad as cigarettes Mar 18, 2007 5:10:48 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: pot does have its props though Mar 18, 2007 5:10:57 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i guess it depends on where you get it then Mar 18, 2007 5:10:59 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, it's often cut with additives Mar 18, 2007 5:11:09 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: like if it's grown, farmers can use it to really help the soil in growing crops Mar 18, 2007 5:11:11 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well thats good... Mar 18, 2007 5:11:21 PM EDT
CMC dah88: lol Mar 18, 2007 5:11:32 PM EDT
CMC dah88: im confused on the whole subject Mar 18, 2007 5:11:39 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: pot as fertilizer Mar 18, 2007 5:11:40 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: nice Mar 18, 2007 5:11:42 PM EDT
CMC dah88: alot of my friends smoke Mar 18, 2007 5:11:45 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah. frankly, i think one of the man issues standing in the way of legalization is that it can't be taxed or regulated easily Mar 18, 2007 5:11:52 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: hey man, it'd help out the US. farmers, and i'm from a farming town... Mar 18, 2007 5:11:55 PM EDT
CMC dah88: lol Mar 18, 2007 5:12:07 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: lol Mar 18, 2007 5:12:09 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i agree with that Mar 18, 2007 5:12:11 PM EDT
CMC dah88: isnt it already really expensive? Mar 18, 2007 5:12:24 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: good god yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:12:34 PM EDT
CMC dah88: y? Mar 18, 2007 5:12:40 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: it adds up if you do it a ot Mar 18, 2007 5:12:45 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lot* Mar 18, 2007 5:12:46 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: it's expensive because it's illegal Mar 18, 2007 5:12:54 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:12:58 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: u can't really mass produce pot Mar 18, 2007 5:13:05 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, and it depends on the dealer, too, and how many middlemen are in between them and the supplier Mar 18, 2007 5:13:05 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: HOWEVER.... Mar 18, 2007 5:13:08 PM EDT
CMC dah88: wow okay lol Mar 18, 2007 5:13:22 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: if it was legalized, do you think the gov't would drop the price since it's legal, or raise it up since so many people would buy it then? Mar 18, 2007 5:13:34 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: wait wait Mar 18, 2007 5:13:44 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i think they'd tax it as much as they could Mar 18, 2007 5:13:57 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: so then the government would be the supplier of pot? Mar 18, 2007 5:14:00 PM EDT
CMC dah88: same Mar 18, 2007 5:14:04 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, so they could tax and regulate it Mar 18, 2007 5:14:11 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think if they did legalize it theyd take full advantage of it Mar 18, 2007 5:14:18 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:14:27 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but the government doesn't control alcohol companies Mar 18, 2007 5:14:28 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: sin tax Mar 18, 2007 5:14:33 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: they wouldn't necessarily control the supply, but they do place taxes on alcohol, cigarettes, gasoline, etc. Mar 18, 2007 5:14:49 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that's why they put taxes on cigs and porn (i learned about it at school)...because they don't want a looooot of people buying it Mar 18, 2007 5:14:55 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: oh ok, yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:14:56 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i agree Mar 18, 2007 5:15:08 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah. and b/c they like money. Mar 18, 2007 5:15:08 PM EDT
CMC dah88: hahaha Mar 18, 2007 5:15:13 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: who doesn't? Mar 18, 2007 5:15:21 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well just to get a vote thing going, because i like doing it, if it WAS legalized, who would buy it? Mar 18, 2007 5:15:45 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: hah, i'm not saying i don't, i just don't like the gov't having too much of my money Mar 18, 2007 5:15:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i probably would Mar 18, 2007 5:15:47 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i wouldn't Mar 18, 2007 5:15:57 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i wouldnt Mar 18, 2007 5:15:58 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but i don't smoke Mar 18, 2007 5:16:02 PM EDT
CMC dah88: me niether Mar 18, 2007 5:16:06 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:16:10 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: hmm....i'm an asthmatic, but maybe once or twice a year Mar 18, 2007 5:16:11 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but i know alot of people who would buy it Mar 18, 2007 5:16:13 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:16:22 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:16:22 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i know a lot of adults who still smoke, too Mar 18, 2007 5:16:36 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: on mom's b-day, the special occasions Mar 18, 2007 5:16:42 PM EDT
CMC dah88: really? Mar 18, 2007 5:16:42 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: hahaha Mar 18, 2007 5:16:42 PM EDT
CMC dah88: thats interesting Mar 18, 2007 5:16:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that'd be horrible Mar 18, 2007 5:16:47 PM EDT
CMC dah88: one of my friends smokes with his mom - what is our world coming to Mar 18, 2007 5:17:06 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: the thing is, they said they wanted to legalize it in small amounts Mar 18, 2007 5:17:09 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, i like that idea Mar 18, 2007 5:17:17 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think that it should be legalized all together Mar 18, 2007 5:17:24 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: who determines what a small amount is though? Mar 18, 2007 5:17:27 PM EDT
CMC dah88: whats a small amount? Mar 18, 2007 5:17:28 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and whats to stop someone from buying over the limit? Mar 18, 2007 5:17:39 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: probably the FDA will determine what that limit Mar 18, 2007 5:17:53 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but in reality, there's no way...like no "big brother" to monitor how much you have or smoke Mar 18, 2007 5:18:08 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Mar 18, 2007 5:18:14 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (1984 reference) Mar 18, 2007 5:18:17 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (oh yeahhhhhh) Mar 18, 2007 5:18:26 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha Mar 18, 2007 5:18:29 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah, so i think tacking that on to the end to make people feel better is useless Mar 18, 2007 5:18:47 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: do you all feel the effects of marijuana are similar enough to alcohol that it should be legalized? Mar 18, 2007 5:18:48 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah. like i said, potheads are less obnoxious Mar 18, 2007 5:19:04 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: it really does mellow you out Mar 18, 2007 5:19:19 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean Mar 18, 2007 5:19:20 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i'm not really clear on the effects Mar 18, 2007 5:19:21 PM EDT
CMC dah88: niether am i Mar 18, 2007 5:19:28 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i was with a friend a few weeks ago who did it Mar 18, 2007 5:19:31 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: wasn't there something about hallucinating? Mar 18, 2007 5:19:32 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: and he was all happy Mar 18, 2007 5:19:34 PM EDT
CMC dah88: my friends say they have gotten really paranoid Mar 18, 2007 5:19:47 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: it usually doesn't cause hallucinations Mar 18, 2007 5:19:48 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: unless it's cut w/ something Mar 18, 2007 5:19:58 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, there isn't hallucination going on Mar 18, 2007 5:20:06 PM EDT
CMC dah88: thats scary to me at least Mar 18, 2007 5:20:09 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: oh ok Mar 18, 2007 5:20:10 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: however, salvia is a really powerful hallucinagin that IS legal Mar 18, 2007 5:20:21 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: and you smoke it Mar 18, 2007 5:20:25 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah, if they make it legal they'd really have to put strict regulations about purity Mar 18, 2007 5:20:32 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: the effects vary from person to person, too Mar 18, 2007 5:20:40 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: ive never heard of that Mar 18, 2007 5:20:48 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right thats wut i have heard Mar 18, 2007 5:20:48 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:21:01 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think if they legalize it it would be made more safe, if its more pure ya know? Mar 18, 2007 5:21:11 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: generally it mellows you, and in many cases intensifies sensory perception (that;s why potheads like pretty lights and pink floyd) Mar 18, 2007 5:21:12 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but they do for alcohol too Mar 18, 2007 5:21:14 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: what? Mar 18, 2007 5:21:32 PM EDT
CMC dah88: ? Mar 18, 2007 5:21:37 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: not that i'm aware of Mar 18, 2007 5:21:45 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: the effects vary -- sorry i was late lol Mar 18, 2007 5:21:48 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: gotcha Mar 18, 2007 5:21:53 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 18, 2007 5:21:53 PM EDT
CMC dah88: o ok Mar 18, 2007 5:22:06 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: do they have like a breathalizer for pot or something so they can tell if you've been driving high? Mar 18, 2007 5:22:26 PM EDT
CMC dah88: would 21 be an okay age to sell it at? and where would you buy it? Mar 18, 2007 5:22:34 PM EDT
CMC dah88: good question Mar 18, 2007 5:22:48 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: they have bars and cafes for it in amsterdam Mar 18, 2007 5:22:51 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: probably over the counter? Mar 18, 2007 5:22:58 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah i know lol...i guess Mar 18, 2007 5:23:03 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: and you have to have a license for it, like a liquor store. Mar 18, 2007 5:23:04 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Mar 18, 2007 5:23:10 PM EDT
CMC dah88: how weird would that ne Mar 18, 2007 5:23:14 PM EDT
CMC dah88: be* Mar 18, 2007 5:23:16 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that's where salvia is sold...over the counter Mar 18, 2007 5:23:20 PM EDT
CMC dah88: thats creepy Mar 18, 2007 5:23:28 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: wow Mar 18, 2007 5:23:33 PM EDT
CMC dah88: ive never even heard of that Mar 18, 2007 5:23:37 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: me neither Mar 18, 2007 5:23:40 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but wait, salvia is actually sold at recher and tape traders i think Mar 18, 2007 5:23:41 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, i dunno. i'd prefer a cash register involved than a back alley Mar 18, 2007 5:23:45 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: tru dat lol Mar 18, 2007 5:23:50 PM EDT
CMC dah88: is it just a drug or does is it used as medicine? Mar 18, 2007 5:23:54 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: seriously Mar 18, 2007 5:23:54 PM EDT
CMC dah88: hahaha Mar 18, 2007 5:24:02 PM EDT
CMC dah88: good point Mar 18, 2007 5:24:04 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: it's just a drug from what i'm aware of Mar 18, 2007 5:24:11 PM EDT
CMC dah88: thats so strange Mar 18, 2007 5:24:17 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: iunno if it's legal everywhere, but it's legal in maryland Mar 18, 2007 5:24:22 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah that seems pretty random Mar 18, 2007 5:24:29 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: to have that be ok but pot illegal Mar 18, 2007 5:24:41 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah thats seems off Mar 18, 2007 5:24:52 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, but there are plenty of things that you can get buzzed off of that are easy to find Mar 18, 2007 5:24:58 PM EDT
CMC dah88: ive heard that some people do better on tests when they are somehwat high Mar 18, 2007 5:25:18 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well like huffing is illegal isnt' it? like the act of it? Mar 18, 2007 5:25:29 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think so Mar 18, 2007 5:25:39 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, my friend took the sat's high, and got a 1590 (true story) Mar 18, 2007 5:25:43 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that's wrong....study high, test high, get high scores Mar 18, 2007 5:25:44 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i can kind of believe that they would do better if they were relaxed Mar 18, 2007 5:25:45 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: given in some cases it can be true, as a generality it's not Mar 18, 2007 5:25:58 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:26:04 PM EDT
CMC dah88: same with my friend (SATs) Mar 18, 2007 5:26:17 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: it doesn't impede SOME people's cognitive processes Mar 18, 2007 5:26:18 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: but it's not a safe bet (didn't study? try pot!....great ad slogan) Mar 18, 2007 5:26:43 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i guess as long as it was proved there were no long term health effects and it was well regulated, i would be ok with pot being legalized Mar 18, 2007 5:26:49 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:26:55 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right - im not really clear on the health issue Mar 18, 2007 5:27:13 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i dont think it is really clear Mar 18, 2007 5:27:24 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: even if there are minimal long term health effects, i think it should. both alcohol and tobacco have long-term health effects Mar 18, 2007 5:27:24 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: in many cases, serious ones Mar 18, 2007 5:27:36 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i agree Mar 18, 2007 5:27:36 PM EDT
CMC dah88: too much of anything is bad for you Mar 18, 2007 5:27:46 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well alcohols effects come from overuse Mar 18, 2007 5:27:46 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: tobaccos can come from moderate use Mar 18, 2007 5:27:58 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right, but they're still serious Mar 18, 2007 5:28:10 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: http://www.salvia.net/ Mar 18, 2007 5:28:15 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: you don't have to smoke 5 packs a day to get lung cancer Mar 18, 2007 5:28:16 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: ik, thats what makes it worse Mar 18, 2007 5:28:26 PM EDT
CMC dah88: and tobacco is still legal Mar 18, 2007 5:28:32 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i kind of think it should be more regulated Mar 18, 2007 5:28:48 PM EDT
CMC dah88: tobacco? Mar 18, 2007 5:28:54 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: like there should be a limit on cigarette purchases or something Mar 18, 2007 5:29:01 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:29:04 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i don't think so Mar 18, 2007 5:29:08 PM EDT
CMC dah88: theres like noway to regulate how much tho Mar 18, 2007 5:29:15 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: if they say they can do it for pot, why not tobacco? Mar 18, 2007 5:29:18 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, they say they can, but the gov't says it can do a lot of things Mar 18, 2007 5:29:41 PM EDT
CMC dah88: u mean like, you can only buy one pack at a time? Mar 18, 2007 5:29:41 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: like a prescription? Mar 18, 2007 5:29:48 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: hahaha Mar 18, 2007 5:29:51 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i have no idea how much tobacco would be considered a healthy dose Mar 18, 2007 5:30:07 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i don't think tobacco should be regulated by how much you can buy...it's a personal choice, just like i think pot should be legalized and be a personal choice Mar 18, 2007 5:30:11 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well, none is healthy Mar 18, 2007 5:30:18 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 18, 2007 5:30:20 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well i dont think banning cigs would go over well Mar 18, 2007 5:30:32 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha Mar 18, 2007 5:30:33 PM EDT
CMC dah88: noway Mar 18, 2007 5:30:43 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:30:48 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: smoker riots Mar 18, 2007 5:30:49 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 18, 2007 5:30:50 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: aka half of this country Mar 18, 2007 5:30:57 PM EDT
CMC dah88: so i guess with pot, either legalize it with no limits or keep it illegal? Mar 18, 2007 5:30:58 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: pretty much Mar 18, 2007 5:31:03 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:31:06 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:31:07 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i agree on that Mar 18, 2007 5:31:12 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i'd go w/ that Mar 18, 2007 5:31:13 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: either treat it like alcohol or keep it illegal Mar 18, 2007 5:31:16 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Mar 18, 2007 5:31:21 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well Mar 18, 2007 5:31:36 PM EDT
CMC dah88: do you think colleges would allow it on campus if it is legalized/ Mar 18, 2007 5:32:23 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: keep your thoughts about marijuana flowing Mar 18, 2007 5:32:24 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: probably not Mar 18, 2007 5:32:38 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: if you treat it like alcohol then, if somebody is driving high (i've talked with two stoners with different opinions based off of experiences)....and they get pulled over...should the penalty be the same for driving w/alcohol as opposed to driving w/pot? Mar 18, 2007 5:32:39 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, i would say so Mar 18, 2007 5:32:52 PM EDT
CMC dah88: me too Mar 18, 2007 5:32:55 PM EDT
CMC dah88: its driving while under an influence Mar 18, 2007 5:33:05 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yes Mar 18, 2007 5:33:06 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: though it is a different type of influence Mar 18, 2007 5:33:22 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean Mar 18, 2007 5:33:24 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: it still impairs your reflexes Mar 18, 2007 5:33:34 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i dont think that matters Mar 18, 2007 5:33:37 PM EDT
CMC dah88: the amount will matter but not the substance Mar 18, 2007 5:33:46 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: right Mar 18, 2007 5:33:49 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Mar 18, 2007 5:33:50 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i know a guy who says that he drives perfectly high, but then i have a friend who could've died by driving on the wrong side of the road high (he's stupid) Mar 18, 2007 5:33:51 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 18, 2007 5:34:01 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well there's people who drive ok when they're drunk too Mar 18, 2007 5:34:06 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:34:11 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: true that Mar 18, 2007 5:34:16 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: maybe he just hasn't run into a situation yet where he would notice how it affects him Mar 18, 2007 5:34:26 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: does anybody think that it's morally wrong to smoke pot? Mar 18, 2007 5:34:36 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: meh. not really. Mar 18, 2007 5:34:50 PM EDT
CMC dah88: if it is legalized do you think there will be more accidents due to high driving? Mar 18, 2007 5:34:52 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: no... Mar 18, 2007 5:34:53 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (religion again...sorry guys) Mar 18, 2007 5:34:55 PM EDT
CMC dah88: it doesnt say in the Bible not to smoke Mar 18, 2007 5:35:11 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right. it just says don't do everything else. Mar 18, 2007 5:35:25 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but i do bet is says somethin about keeping your body pure and take care of your body Mar 18, 2007 5:35:30 PM EDT
CMC dah88: so im not sure Mar 18, 2007 5:35:42 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think its a personal call as to morals Mar 18, 2007 5:35:46 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:35:49 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah id agree Mar 18, 2007 5:35:54 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: so are you saying that cigs are immoral then? Mar 18, 2007 5:35:59 PM EDT
CMC dah88: im not saying anything is immoral Mar 18, 2007 5:36:13 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i wouldn't fault someone for not wanting to smoke on moral grounds, but i don't feel that way Mar 18, 2007 5:36:26 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: with the whole keeping your body pure bit...? Mar 18, 2007 5:36:27 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: gotcha Mar 18, 2007 5:36:34 PM EDT
CMC dah88: im not sure what it says in the Bible so i cant answer Mar 18, 2007 5:36:37 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: its just a judgement call as to what u want to do to your body Mar 18, 2007 5:36:40 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i mean, you know the risks Mar 18, 2007 5:36:49 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Mar 18, 2007 5:36:56 PM EDT
CMC dah88: its your choice Mar 18, 2007 5:37:00 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, i think it should be that way for pot Mar 18, 2007 5:37:03 PM EDT
CMC dah88: same Mar 18, 2007 5:37:07 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and if you feel guilty for putting yourself in danger of lung cancer or whatever, then its morally wrong for you Mar 18, 2007 5:37:11 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think if pot was legalized the effects have to be made clearer to the public Mar 18, 2007 5:37:31 PM EDT
CMC dah88: like the effects of cigs are Mar 18, 2007 5:37:36 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah, definitely Mar 18, 2007 5:37:38 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, but it's hard to do legal research on it right now Mar 18, 2007 5:37:50 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: it would have to come with its own little surgeon general's warning Mar 18, 2007 5:37:55 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: since it's still an illegal substance Mar 18, 2007 5:37:58 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats not necessarily true Mar 18, 2007 5:38:06 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i know research is going on at this school on psilocybin, the main chemical in magic mushrooms Mar 18, 2007 5:38:27 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: medical research can be done, but there's a lot of red tape Mar 18, 2007 5:38:31 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: and most of that type of research has gov't involvement Mar 18, 2007 5:38:51 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but if it might be made legal thats an important thing to know Mar 18, 2007 5:38:54 PM EDT
CMC dah88: the gov would want to know i think Mar 18, 2007 5:39:03 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: they experimented w/ lsd as truth serum in the 60s Mar 18, 2007 5:39:14 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah, then they should fund more research Mar 18, 2007 5:39:22 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yup Mar 18, 2007 5:39:28 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: the gov't can get anything in reality Mar 18, 2007 5:39:33 PM EDT
CMC dah88: ? Mar 18, 2007 5:39:39 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: hahah surgeon general's warning: you will have a good time Mar 18, 2007 5:39:50 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: hahaha Mar 18, 2007 5:39:59 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: lol Mar 18, 2007 5:40:02 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: there have to be some long term health effects Mar 18, 2007 5:40:13 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i dont understand what you meant by they cant get anything? Mar 18, 2007 5:40:20 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: the government CAN get anything drug wise Mar 18, 2007 5:40:39 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yes, so cant they test it? Mar 18, 2007 5:40:51 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, they totally can Mar 18, 2007 5:40:59 PM EDT
CMC dah88: oh thats what you were saying? lol Mar 18, 2007 5:41:13 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: did i word it weird? Mar 18, 2007 5:41:13 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:41:20 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: then they really need to before this becomes legal Mar 18, 2007 5:41:20 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 18, 2007 5:41:21 PM EDT
CMC dah88: o ok i just got confused sorry! Mar 18, 2007 5:41:22 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: no problemo Mar 18, 2007 5:41:31 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha i was confused too Mar 18, 2007 5:41:34 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (sorry duuuuuudes) Mar 18, 2007 5:41:42 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, but that doesn't mean they will. i don't think they want to legalize it for economic reasons Mar 18, 2007 5:41:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think that economically, it will help] Mar 18, 2007 5:42:00 PM EDT
CMC dah88: me too Mar 18, 2007 5:42:05 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: but not them Mar 18, 2007 5:42:08 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean, knock off like half of the black market.... Mar 18, 2007 5:42:10 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: true, and then they could tax it and stuff Mar 18, 2007 5:42:22 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:42:28 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: the black market is what screws our government over Mar 18, 2007 5:42:28 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: it'd be much harder to tax though, b/c it's production and distribution is fundamentally different from other controlled substabces Mar 18, 2007 5:42:58 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:42:59 PM EDT
CMC dah88: not if it was sold over the counter Mar 18, 2007 5:43:11 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: but you can't stop all the people who already grow it in their house, back yards, etc., from still undercutting the market illegally at a cheaper price Mar 18, 2007 5:43:40 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well its got to go through some company before it can be sold Mar 18, 2007 5:43:43 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: true Mar 18, 2007 5:43:48 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i guess so Mar 18, 2007 5:43:54 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but they might disappear after a while --- i mean, you don't hear so much about bootleggers anymore, right? Mar 18, 2007 5:44:14 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i know some people do grow their own tobacco Mar 18, 2007 5:44:15 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i don't see the big deal Mar 18, 2007 5:44:19 PM EDT
CMC dah88: im sure people will still grow pot Mar 18, 2007 5:45:04 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah, there will always be some Mar 18, 2007 5:45:14 PM EDT
CMC dah88: especially if it is going to be more expensive to buy Mar 18, 2007 5:45:16 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right, but alcohol is expensive to make and distribute; it's not worth the trouble, financially. A LOT of people could still grow pot illegally, and that would disrupt the legal market Mar 18, 2007 5:45:37 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well, if it was too expensive, economically the companies would lower their prices Mar 18, 2007 5:45:58 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah i guess you're right Mar 18, 2007 5:46:03 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i don't think the price of pot will be a huge deal Mar 18, 2007 5:46:08 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: if there are taxes on it, i think it would be a big deal Mar 18, 2007 5:46:25 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and they could grow huge fields of it, so it would be easier for them to go cheaper Mar 18, 2007 5:46:25 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think it owuld because i kno thats a huge issue with my friends Mar 18, 2007 5:46:26 PM EDT
CMC dah88: where and who they get it from is always a big deal Mar 18, 2007 5:46:34 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but all pot would have to be regulation if it was legal Mar 18, 2007 5:47:00 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: so wouldn't it not matter as much who you get it from? Mar 18, 2007 5:47:12 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think that the companies would eventually drop the prices Mar 18, 2007 5:47:28 PM EDT
CMC dah88: well what about the people still getting it from people that grow it ? Mar 18, 2007 5:47:29 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: you have to remember too that when it is grown en masse, it's normally imported illegally. and it would all be regulated in theory, but right, that doesn't stop illegal entrepreneurs Mar 18, 2007 5:47:48 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well they'd just be taking a risk, they wouldnt know exactly what they were getting Mar 18, 2007 5:48:11 PM EDT
CMC dah88: true Mar 18, 2007 5:48:12 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i don't think that people growing it will matter Mar 18, 2007 5:48:13 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: in reality, like look at alcohol Mar 18, 2007 5:48:23 PM EDT
CMC dah88: y not? Mar 18, 2007 5:48:25 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: used to be stricly prohibited Mar 18, 2007 5:48:33 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: now they sell kits to do it Mar 18, 2007 5:48:39 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha true Mar 18, 2007 5:48:48 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean Mar 18, 2007 5:48:52 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: it was strictly prohibited for a very short period, though, and was largely controlled by the mob during that time Mar 18, 2007 5:48:56 PM EDT
CMC dah88: they do? Mar 18, 2007 5:48:59 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: you could buy your mom a pot growing chia pet for mothers day Mar 18, 2007 5:49:00 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i would like to invest in my own eventually quite personally Mar 18, 2007 5:49:07 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: HAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Mar 18, 2007 5:49:13 PM EDT
CMC dah88: thats so funny i had no idea Mar 18, 2007 5:49:20 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i really need to read up on this topic Mar 18, 2007 5:49:28 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean Mar 18, 2007 5:49:36 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: what about moonshine Mar 18, 2007 5:49:46 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: but you already have a huge embedded system of people producing and selling pot Mar 18, 2007 5:49:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: is that legal or no? Mar 18, 2007 5:49:50 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i know they sell it, but isn't making it illegal? Mar 18, 2007 5:49:56 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: you did in the 20s for alcohol too Mar 18, 2007 5:50:00 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Mar 18, 2007 5:50:09 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: but not for an extended period, and probably not nearly as large or sophisticated Mar 18, 2007 5:50:19 PM EDT
CMC dah88: would legalizing it effect that "area of business" Mar 18, 2007 5:50:38 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: prohibition lasted a relatively short period Mar 18, 2007 5:50:39 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: true Mar 18, 2007 5:50:50 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah....people are too lazy to organized the underground pot society Mar 18, 2007 5:50:51 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 18, 2007 5:50:52 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: lol Mar 18, 2007 5:50:55 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: organize* Mar 18, 2007 5:50:58 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, i dunno. i'd argue that the black market would continue unabated, and that's what the gov't is afraid of (i'm not saying i wouldn't legalize it for those reasons) Mar 18, 2007 5:51:43 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah i dont think it owuld be effected Mar 18, 2007 5:51:58 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think newbies to the pot scene would buy it legit from stores Mar 18, 2007 5:52:19 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah, maybe it will eventually cut off the blackmarket Mar 18, 2007 5:52:45 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and eventually old customers who were faithful to dealers would get old and stuff... Mar 18, 2007 5:53:03 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think that the gov't would get money out of it which is why it's good, but i also feel as though the black market will decrease with it, but never entirely Mar 18, 2007 5:53:04 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah, it'll probably never disappear Mar 18, 2007 5:53:19 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: probably some, but they'd have to be prepared to pay a lot more for a long time, and i think that that portion of the market isn't large enough for the gov't to care about Mar 18, 2007 5:53:24 PM EDT
CMC dah88: agreed Mar 18, 2007 5:53:26 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i feel strongly about that Mar 18, 2007 5:53:27 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: totally agreed Mar 18, 2007 5:53:51 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yup Mar 18, 2007 5:53:58 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: isn't it nice when we all get along??? Mar 18, 2007 5:54:08 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 18, 2007 5:54:09 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha Mar 18, 2007 5:54:11 PM EDT
