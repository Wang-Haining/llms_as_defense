CMC CrashNburn321: Okay. Mar 21, 2007 7:01:24 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: Our first topic is gender discrimination Mar 21, 2007 7:02:08 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Anything specific about it? Mar 21, 2007 7:02:18 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: here's a little story you guys can think about/respond to, or jsut give your general thoughts on the topic Mar 21, 2007 7:02:40 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: In Maryland recently, several IT executives are being investigated for creating a minority-owned business that was just a front. The excutives' wives were listed as the heads of the business so that they could more easily procure government contracts targeted at minority and women-owned businesses. But there were no employees--all the work was to be done by the firms headed by the male executives. Mar 21, 2007 7:02:42 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well that seems more like reverse discrimination Mar 21, 2007 7:03:27 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: well keep in mind, gender discrimination can refer to discrimination against men or women Mar 21, 2007 7:03:49 PM EDT
CMC rocks: because they wanted to benefit from looking like female-owned business Mar 21, 2007 7:03:51 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yes, that's true Mar 21, 2007 7:04:00 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Could it be justified as a business decision? Mar 21, 2007 7:04:09 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well it was lying Mar 21, 2007 7:04:21 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Or do you think that would just gloss over the truth. Mar 21, 2007 7:04:27 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Ok. Mar 21, 2007 7:04:31 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: well aren't things such as affirmative action and the example in that story types of discrimination, even if they are aimed at helping a minority group? Mar 21, 2007 7:04:38 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yes i would say so Mar 21, 2007 7:04:47 PM EDT
CMC rocks: it's usually referred to as reverse discrimination because it helps people who are usually discriminated against, but in doing so, it does discrimintate Mar 21, 2007 7:05:23 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: ok, yeah that's what i was trying to say Mar 21, 2007 7:05:42 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: thanks :) Mar 21, 2007 7:05:55 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: It is "discrimination" in that it isolates one group from another by making them preffered. Mar 21, 2007 7:05:55 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: preferred* Mar 21, 2007 7:06:02 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Are there a lot of issues like this in the news, because to me generder discrimination is a thing of the past Mar 21, 2007 7:06:06 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: ? Mar 21, 2007 7:06:08 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: gender8 Mar 21, 2007 7:06:19 PM EDT
CMC rocks: really? Mar 21, 2007 7:06:25 PM EDT
[CMC Goldeneye left the session] Mar 21, 2007 7:06:37 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: I wouldn't say that it's gone. Mar 21, 2007 7:06:42 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i don't think that it is a thing of the past. i would say that it is not QUITE as big of an issue as it used to be, but it still exists. Mar 21, 2007 7:06:46 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Right. Mar 21, 2007 7:06:53 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah i agree with that Mar 21, 2007 7:07:04 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i think the reason it's not as big as it used to be is because people are making a conscious effort against it Mar 21, 2007 7:07:36 PM EDT
[CMC Goldeneye joined the session] Mar 21, 2007 7:07:39 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: But if we are making progress, are we moving fast enough to curb gender discrimination? Mar 21, 2007 7:07:42 PM EDT
CMC rocks: like people are more aware of it now Mar 21, 2007 7:07:42 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: do you think that there is still gender discrimination in the areas of jobs males hold vs females? Mar 21, 2007 7:08:00 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Sorry about that. Mar 21, 2007 7:08:02 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Then again, is it even possible to completely get rid of any sort of discrimination? Mar 21, 2007 7:08:18 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: it's okay Mar 21, 2007 7:08:25 PM EDT
CMC rocks: probably not Mar 21, 2007 7:08:27 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I don't think so Mar 21, 2007 7:08:45 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah i don't think that it will ever be possible to completely eliminate it Mar 21, 2007 7:08:47 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but it is still possible to go further than we have come so far Mar 21, 2007 7:08:52 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: I agree. Mar 21, 2007 7:08:58 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but i do think it exists in the workplace Mar 21, 2007 7:09:15 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: can you give more specific details, rocks? Mar 21, 2007 7:09:34 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: in response to nicole's question about discrimination in jobs, i definitely think that there is Mar 21, 2007 7:09:42 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: What type of discrimination? Mar 21, 2007 7:09:58 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Or how, I should say Mar 21, 2007 7:10:10 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well certain fiels are still dominated by males Mar 21, 2007 7:10:19 PM EDT
CMC rocks: sciences particularly Mar 21, 2007 7:10:25 PM EDT
CMC rocks: things like engineering Mar 21, 2007 7:10:29 PM EDT
CMC rocks: and then some jobs are considered too flowery for males Mar 21, 2007 7:10:37 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: for example, you always hear about the "glass ceiling" where women can look above and see the jobs that men hold but they can't reach that point Mar 21, 2007 7:10:39 PM EDT
CMC rocks: like nursing Mar 21, 2007 7:10:39 PM EDT
CMC rocks: exactly Mar 21, 2007 7:10:44 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Aren't men found to be naturally more apt in certain fields, and women in others? Mar 21, 2007 7:10:48 PM EDT
CMC rocks: broadly speaking, possibly Mar 21, 2007 7:10:59 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i agree with rocks that these stereotypes exist Mar 21, 2007 7:11:07 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: In a broad sense, statistics might show a considerable difference between jobs among males and females. Mar 21, 2007 7:11:22 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but people generalize to think that given a woman, she can't do a man's job, even though she may be an instance of a person who is more capable than most men Mar 21, 2007 7:11:28 PM EDT
CMC rocks: even if the broad generalizations are true, people shouldn't assume anything about a particular person based on their gender Mar 21, 2007 7:12:16 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Perhaps. Mar 21, 2007 7:12:17 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Did any of you experienece any personal discrimination at your jobs, or witness it or anything? Mar 21, 2007 7:12:36 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but i also think that these stereotypes exist for a reason. while there might be SOME women who could be physically capable of doing certain jobs usually reserved for men, MOST women don't necessarily fit into that category Mar 21, 2007 7:12:55 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah but that's still not accounting for the few women who might be just as good or better Mar 21, 2007 7:13:24 PM EDT
CMC rocks: if you generalize like that, you'll miss even the few good ones Mar 21, 2007 7:13:36 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: ok, yes i do agree that you can't assume anything about a particular person. Mar 21, 2007 7:13:40 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: If those are the circumstances, then yes, I agree. Mar 21, 2007 7:13:50 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: But it differs on a case by case basis Mar 21, 2007 7:14:02 PM EDT
CMC rocks: what do you mean? Mar 21, 2007 7:14:11 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: who? Mar 21, 2007 7:15:17 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: A specific field, a specific employer, hiring requirements, qualifications. It would seem as though, at least in some instances, if a man was chosen over a woman for a position because of one of these reasons, it could be misinterpreted as discrimination. Mar 21, 2007 7:15:32 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: I suppose the reverse could hold true too. Mar 21, 2007 7:15:47 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah, that could and probably does happen Mar 21, 2007 7:15:50 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I definitely agree with that. Mar 21, 2007 7:16:00 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: me too Mar 21, 2007 7:16:03 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah, i think the hardest thing is to differentiate between someone being selected for a job because of their abilities versus their gender Mar 21, 2007 7:16:27 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Unless one person decides another person is not right for a job solely based on gender, I don't believe it is discrimination. Mar 21, 2007 7:16:35 PM EDT
CMC rocks: it can easily be misconstrued Mar 21, 2007 7:16:41 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Exactly. Mar 21, 2007 7:16:43 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well what if gender is a factor? Mar 21, 2007 7:16:55 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i would still consider that discrimination Mar 21, 2007 7:17:02 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Ah. Mar 21, 2007 7:17:04 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i actually feel that that sort of situation comes up a lot (both in gender and racial discrimination) where if a certain person is chosen or not chosen regardless of gender or race, someone cites discrimination as the reason for it. when that is used as an excuse too often it becomes old. Mar 21, 2007 7:17:22 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Again, I think you would need to return to the specific circumstances. Mar 21, 2007 7:17:23 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: But whats the trade-off? If an employer tries extra hard not to discriminate against gender, he or she could be hiring employees that are not qualified for that position. Mar 21, 2007 7:17:40 PM EDT
CMC rocks: right, or only hiring minorities Mar 21, 2007 7:17:54 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Hence, we have some controversy over affirmative action. Mar 21, 2007 7:17:57 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Exactly. Mar 21, 2007 7:18:01 PM EDT
CMC rocks: which is discrimination in its own way Mar 21, 2007 7:18:04 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: exactly...that's what i meant earlier. Mar 21, 2007 7:18:14 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: how do you feel that pay rates of jobs are affected by gender? are they at all? Mar 21, 2007 7:19:17 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Statistics do show a wage gap between men and women. Mar 21, 2007 7:19:36 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: A considerable one at that. Mar 21, 2007 7:19:42 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Men and women in the same jobs? Mar 21, 2007 7:19:52 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well in the same way that it may be harder for women to get certain jobs, it's hard for them to advance in those jobs Mar 21, 2007 7:19:57 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: same or different Mar 21, 2007 7:19:58 PM EDT
CMC rocks: it is definitely true for the same jobs, which is where it's the biggest problem Mar 21, 2007 7:20:14 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah i think that it's pretty much been shown in studies that there exists a substantial difference between the salaries of men and women in the exact same positions and that, to me, is a problem. Mar 21, 2007 7:21:55 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I can't see how that would happen in a modern world like ours. It's rediculous. Mar 21, 2007 7:22:29 PM EDT
CMC rocks: the problem with people getting raises is that there's no clear qulaifications for getting to the next pay stage Mar 21, 2007 7:22:44 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Are we talking about high-paying business type jobs? Mar 21, 2007 7:22:52 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well it's definitely true, sad as that may be Mar 21, 2007 7:22:55 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well the higher the salary, the bigger the difference would probably be Mar 21, 2007 7:23:12 PM EDT
CMC rocks: more room for disparity Mar 21, 2007 7:23:24 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: The problem is aggravated even more because of a lack of uniformity among company/ business/ general policy. Say, you have a male doctor at a given hospital, and a female doctor at another. She could be paid less than him, yet not for the reason that she's female. One could simply be a busier place. It's context-dependent, and we would need to be careful as to where to assign "blame" for discrimination. Mar 21, 2007 7:23:32 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Sorry, took awhile to type. Mar 21, 2007 7:23:59 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: haha Mar 21, 2007 7:24:04 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: this issue is really hard to tie down. There is no way to prove whether any data collected (like wage gaps) is due to discrimination or other reasons. Mar 21, 2007 7:24:51 PM EDT
CMC rocks: that does probably have a lot to do with it, but since it is a general trend, the context thing might not be that important because you would expect those difference to even out Mar 21, 2007 7:24:56 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: And I don't know if I agree with something someone said before: the higher the wage, the bigger the gap. I would think the opposite. Mar 21, 2007 7:25:34 PM EDT
CMC rocks: if you were only comparing two hospitals, then the context would be a big deal, but i don't think it's that important if you see a wage gap in the big picture Mar 21, 2007 7:25:35 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: That could be true. How broad of a perspective you take could definitely affect that. Mar 21, 2007 7:25:42 PM EDT
CMC rocks: why would you think the opposite? Mar 21, 2007 7:26:02 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: It depends on where you look, and how "broad" your focus is. Mar 21, 2007 7:26:30 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i DO agree with the higher the wage the bigger the gap Mar 21, 2007 7:26:41 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Like, if you assessed a group of business in one city, any differences could be greatly exaggerated. Mar 21, 2007 7:27:00 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yes, because if people's salaries differed by even one percent, that would be so minor for a minimum wage salary, but it would be significant for someone making six digits Mar 21, 2007 7:27:28 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: exactly rocks Mar 21, 2007 7:27:39 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Right. Mar 21, 2007 7:27:49 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: For a woman or man to move upward and upward on the pay ladder, ideally the person would be a charismatic, intelligent individual. I can't imagine a man and woman sitting in the same board room or something and receiving two highly seperate salaries. That is, unless it's proven fact. Mar 21, 2007 7:28:05 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Ideally, yes. Mar 21, 2007 7:28:48 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Did that make sense at all? haha Mar 21, 2007 7:28:52 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well i think even in the same company, things like that happen Mar 21, 2007 7:29:24 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: what do you mean Mar 21, 2007 7:29:39 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: ? Mar 21, 2007 7:29:43 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Yeah, it does and you're correct. The only thing is that idealism doesn't exactly pan out in business situations. Mar 21, 2007 7:29:45 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Or any situation for that matter, not even specifically business. Mar 21, 2007 7:29:58 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well, of course. Mar 21, 2007 7:30:05 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i think that this situation has been studied most often in a business situation , which is why that is a commonly cited example Mar 21, 2007 7:30:33 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yes, and its easy to tell the difference by comparing salaries Mar 21, 2007 7:30:52 PM EDT
CMC rocks: it's very concrete evidence Mar 21, 2007 7:31:01 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: and it is also a situation where it has been shown to have been true, as ridiculous as it might seem Mar 21, 2007 7:31:05 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: So what changes could be made to resolve this issue, if any? Mar 21, 2007 7:32:14 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: And how feasible would any such changes be? Mar 21, 2007 7:32:27 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well like before we said it will probably never be completely fixed Mar 21, 2007 7:32:55 PM EDT
CMC rocks: do you think something like affirmative action will work or just make the problem worse? Mar 21, 2007 7:33:13 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: There's definitely some potential for progress towards a more "level" playing field. It seems like any change would have to be gradual, rather than "all at once." Mar 21, 2007 7:34:02 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah it's a difficult situation because there are certain occupations where salaries are more widely known, but once you start talking about upper level business positions, the salaries can become astronomical....and it's in those cases where it is difficult to control. Mar 21, 2007 7:34:47 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I don't think so. Men and women have been proven to be naturally more skilled in different areas. Nothing has been proven in terms of race, however. Mar 21, 2007 7:34:57 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: (answering your question, rocks) Mar 21, 2007 7:35:06 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: So I don't think something like affirmative action can ever be justified fully. Mar 21, 2007 7:35:36 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well specific things about race Mar 21, 2007 7:35:42 PM EDT
CMC rocks: like i know african-americans can run faster Mar 21, 2007 7:35:52 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: (yeah sorry that was confusing, mine was in response to crashnburn's earlier question about how feasible changes would be) Mar 21, 2007 7:35:54 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but i don't know how much is known about job abilities Mar 21, 2007 7:36:07 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: ball Mar 21, 2007 7:37:59 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye:  Mar 21, 2007 7:37:59 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Sorry, my roommate doesn't understadn the importance of gender discrimination. lol Mar 21, 2007 7:38:38 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: I know of a pizza place that hires only men and they refuse to hire women-- any thoughts on this? Mar 21, 2007 7:39:35 PM EDT
CMC rocks: that's definitely gender discrimination Mar 21, 2007 7:39:51 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: well do they have a reason for that policy? Mar 21, 2007 7:39:52 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Obvious gender discrimination. lol Mar 21, 2007 7:39:52 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: It seems like that would be a smaller business, which would make it easier for them to get away with it. Mar 21, 2007 7:40:06 PM EDT
CMC rocks: no offense, but it doesn't take superior mental skills to make a pizza Mar 21, 2007 7:40:11 PM EDT
CMC rocks: there's nothing particular about males that would make them better pizza-makers Mar 21, 2007 7:40:25 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: good points (crash and rocks) Mar 21, 2007 7:40:25 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah, it probably would be eaiser for them to get away with, but its still just as bad Mar 21, 2007 7:40:51 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: do you think the government should be keeping closer tabs on businesses like this? Mar 21, 2007 7:40:55 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Again, you would need to return to the question of how feasible any sort of policy change would be. Mar 21, 2007 7:41:22 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Something could/should definitely be done to stop gender discrimination on that level. Mar 21, 2007 7:41:39 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah, well i think noting it would be a good idea on the part of the government Mar 21, 2007 7:41:49 PM EDT
CMC rocks: so people don't try to get away with as much Mar 21, 2007 7:42:00 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: And how would you "enforce" it? Mar 21, 2007 7:42:06 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Some sort of fine? Mar 21, 2007 7:42:19 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well a business could face something like that Mar 21, 2007 7:42:28 PM EDT
CMC rocks: or even lose their business if they refuse to change Mar 21, 2007 7:42:41 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i'm not really sure what would work...it's a difficult situation because you don't want to advocate TOO much govenment intervention into the business world, but at the same time you need to have some sort of regulation to prevent unfair practices Mar 21, 2007 7:45:37 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: That seems to be a classic problem. Mar 21, 2007 7:46:02 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah, i hadn't thought of it that way, but it is important to keep govt out of business if possible Mar 21, 2007 7:46:23 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I agree. However, in a situation where it is as clear-cut as a pizza place who only hires women, something can definitely be done. Mar 21, 2007 7:46:44 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah, i can't believe people would even attempt that Mar 21, 2007 7:47:07 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I mean men Mar 21, 2007 7:47:09 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (anybody?) Mar 21, 2007 7:47:19 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (sorry ignore that, my window wasn't scrolling) Mar 21, 2007 7:47:28 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Ah. Mar 21, 2007 7:47:35 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: Okay guys, I think we've killed this topic, shall we move on? Mar 21, 2007 7:49:33 PM EDT
CMC rocks: sure Mar 21, 2007 7:49:43 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: absolutely Mar 21, 2007 7:49:46 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Alright. Mar 21, 2007 7:49:53 PM EDT
