CMC GOBIGDONNY: privacy Apr 1, 2007 5:18:43 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: do you feel it is an invasion of privacy for school officials to read facebook/myspace profiles Apr 1, 2007 5:18:45 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i draw my shades when i change clothes Apr 1, 2007 5:18:50 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o Apr 1, 2007 5:18:56 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: nope, its public information, you put it out there, its gonna get seen Apr 1, 2007 5:19:00 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: possibly getting kids in trouble for what they put there? Apr 1, 2007 5:19:04 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: when you put things on the internet you have to assume its going to get seen especailly on things like that Apr 1, 2007 5:19:31 PM EDT
CMC blue322: yeah i agree with loco, if they put it out there is out there for th epublic to seee Apr 1, 2007 5:19:32 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: kk Apr 1, 2007 5:19:38 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: internet = public domain Apr 1, 2007 5:19:47 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: absolutly Apr 1, 2007 5:19:51 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and by the way, that question should be up to mark zuckerberg, he owns EVERYTHING you post up there Apr 1, 2007 5:19:59 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: public servers = no privacy at least to the stie owner Apr 1, 2007 5:20:18 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: last year in the SGA i championed the facebook privacy issue Apr 1, 2007 5:20:30 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: so what did you say? Apr 1, 2007 5:20:40 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and after putting a SHIT TON of effort into it, we figured out some kind of consensus Apr 1, 2007 5:20:44 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: basically, when you visit a website you are subjected to the same rights as in any private institution Apr 1, 2007 5:20:47 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: what was your consensus donny Apr 1, 2007 5:21:00 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: we had public forums for students and drafted a student opinion statement, and what we ended up reaching with the school administration was this: Apr 1, 2007 5:21:14 PM EDT
CMC blue322: your on sga? Apr 1, 2007 5:21:29 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: errrrr no Apr 1, 2007 5:21:35 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: errrr maybe Apr 1, 2007 5:21:38 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: haha Apr 1, 2007 5:21:39 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i doubt it Apr 1, 2007 5:21:42 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: they don't have a policy on it, BUT, when it comes to judicial hearings: Apr 1, 2007 5:21:50 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: you should run, youd probably win with your attitude though Apr 1, 2007 5:22:04 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: they will not bring the FB evidence up in your hearing, because that would be opening a whole new can of worms Apr 1, 2007 5:22:19 PM EDT
CMC blue322: ....... Apr 1, 2007 5:22:19 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: thats good Apr 1, 2007 5:22:27 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: BUT, there is no way that they can ensure that EVERY pjb member who is judging you wont look Apr 1, 2007 5:22:31 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: yeah it would Apr 1, 2007 5:22:31 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: AND, there is no way for them to guarantee that no admins will ever look at it before a trial, even tho they cant bring it up Apr 1, 2007 5:22:46 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: also, a lot of employers now a days look you up on the internet Apr 1, 2007 5:22:52 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: cuz last year, two kids in my grade got kicked out and FB evidence was brought up in their trial Apr 1, 2007 5:23:00 PM EDT
CMC blue322: what was found on faceboook Apr 1, 2007 5:23:15 PM EDT
CMC blue322: that got them kicked out Apr 1, 2007 5:23:20 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: so my grade had a shitfit and i made sure the administration knew that... so even tho its kind of dont ask dont tell, the rule of thumb is WATCH WHAT YOU PUT UP ON THERE Apr 1, 2007 5:23:26 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: york road shenanigans Apr 1, 2007 5:23:31 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: a fight basically Apr 1, 2007 5:23:35 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: on york road when the bars got out Apr 1, 2007 5:23:41 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: thats a bad idea Apr 1, 2007 5:23:47 PM EDT
CMC blue322: oooh Apr 1, 2007 5:23:47 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and there was a FB picture that placed the kids at murphys and it was timestamped 20 mins before the fight Apr 1, 2007 5:23:59 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: scott eckhardt (student life admin) brought the pic up and shoved it in the one kids face at the trial Apr 1, 2007 5:24:19 PM EDT
CMC blue322: now, if you have privacy as only friends can see your profile Apr 1, 2007 5:24:28 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but the VP presiding over the trial was like WOOOOAH PUT THAT SHIT AWAY Apr 1, 2007 5:24:30 PM EDT
CMC blue322: how does the administration see it Apr 1, 2007 5:24:37 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: most kids dont have privacy like that Apr 1, 2007 5:24:45 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but almost all admins/profs do Apr 1, 2007 5:24:50 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: the students can on facebook now Apr 1, 2007 5:24:58 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i think that facebook evidence should not be used since facebook is not owned by loyola Apr 1, 2007 5:24:59 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: you would be appalled to know how many staff/faculty here are on the FB regularly Apr 1, 2007 5:24:59 PM EDT
CMC blue322: they have fb accounts? Apr 1, 2007 5:25:00 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its kinda like them searching through one of your own personal bags Apr 1, 2007 5:25:09 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: myspace cant however, you have to be underage for your profile to be private Apr 1, 2007 5:25:14 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: shoop: that was a part of our ratified statement of student opinion Apr 1, 2007 5:25:18 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: blue, yes they do Apr 1, 2007 5:25:29 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: almost ALL the VP's, and bunch of the profs. have FB Apr 1, 2007 5:25:35 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its the same reason why you dont have to open your backpack when you're walking in from jerrys or wine underground on a friday Apr 1, 2007 5:25:40 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: lots of office staffers too Apr 1, 2007 5:25:41 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i dont think its like searching through a bag at all Apr 1, 2007 5:25:46 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: Im with blue here Apr 1, 2007 5:25:53 PM EDT
CMC blue322: your posting pictures to get attention Apr 1, 2007 5:25:55 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: If youre stupid enough to put it out there Apr 1, 2007 5:26:00 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but its a privately owned website Apr 1, 2007 5:26:05 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: technically, they are allowed to do whatever the hell they want, this is a private institution Apr 1, 2007 5:26:06 PM EDT
CMC blue322: and you ggot the attention, just not the way u wanted Apr 1, 2007 5:26:07 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its up to the website to take action, not the school Apr 1, 2007 5:26:10 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: its public information Apr 1, 2007 5:26:17 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i have heard a loyola VP say out loud that "when you arrive at loyola, you check your constitutional rights at the door" Apr 1, 2007 5:26:26 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: public to an extent, but unless it has malicious intent it should be kept private Apr 1, 2007 5:26:34 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: thats at ANY private intstitution Apr 1, 2007 5:26:39 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i think its good they have that rule Apr 1, 2007 5:26:52 PM EDT
CMC blue322: there are too many dirtbags Apr 1, 2007 5:26:57 PM EDT
CMC blue322: gets rid of them Apr 1, 2007 5:27:02 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: no, its indeed public Apr 1, 2007 5:27:06 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: it can also screw you over Apr 1, 2007 5:27:08 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: youve put it onto a public domain Apr 1, 2007 5:27:13 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: that makes it public Apr 1, 2007 5:27:16 PM EDT
CMC blue322: then you shouldnt post it if your worried Apr 1, 2007 5:27:22 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: exactly Apr 1, 2007 5:27:25 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: the internet is technically public domain Apr 1, 2007 5:27:26 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but only certain people that you allow can view your profile Apr 1, 2007 5:27:31 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and if you dont allow them, how can they have any right to view it? Apr 1, 2007 5:27:44 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: there ya go, so then set your data that way Apr 1, 2007 5:27:46 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: tehy dont Apr 1, 2007 5:27:47 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: so shoop we have the right to set the privacy like that Apr 1, 2007 5:27:53 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: sure, its public to an extent Apr 1, 2007 5:27:54 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but many choose not to because they post the pics in the first place so people will see them drinking etc etc Apr 1, 2007 5:28:13 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: we arent saying they break through the security Apr 1, 2007 5:28:16 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i dont think they care that much Apr 1, 2007 5:28:28 PM EDT
CMC blue322: but if your posting pics of stuff u shouldnt be doing Apr 1, 2007 5:28:36 PM EDT
CMC blue322: its just like throwing in their face Apr 1, 2007 5:28:43 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but what if the picture was taken off campus? Apr 1, 2007 5:28:52 PM EDT
CMC blue322: it* Apr 1, 2007 5:28:53 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: why does the campus have any right to prosecute you for it Apr 1, 2007 5:29:00 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its out of their jurisdiction Apr 1, 2007 5:29:12 PM EDT
CMC blue322: are u talking about stuff on york road? Apr 1, 2007 5:29:13 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: fells point Apr 1, 2007 5:29:19 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: home Apr 1, 2007 5:29:21 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: its evidence of a persons character Apr 1, 2007 5:29:23 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: because you are a loyola college student and in attending this school you agreed to comply with rules/regulations/standards Apr 1, 2007 5:29:24 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: so absolutly it can be brought up Apr 1, 2007 5:29:29 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: as expressed in the handbook Apr 1, 2007 5:29:31 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and if you are 19 years old and there is a pic of you double fisting two bottles of budweiser.... Apr 1, 2007 5:29:42 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but what if i have a picture of me drinking at home with my friends from 3 years ago Apr 1, 2007 5:29:44 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: before i agreed Apr 1, 2007 5:29:50 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and all of that jazz Apr 1, 2007 5:29:53 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: should the school have any right to take me down? Apr 1, 2007 5:30:02 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i dont think they would file judicial action against u for that Apr 1, 2007 5:30:05 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: im not trying to prove the whole privacy thing Apr 1, 2007 5:30:13 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: im just trying to make the water a bit darker Apr 1, 2007 5:30:22 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: oooh yeah one more thing from last year: Apr 1, 2007 5:30:34 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: there are so many things you have to worry about with the privacy issue Apr 1, 2007 5:30:36 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: like? Apr 1, 2007 5:30:40 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: well, there are many lines that need to be drawn between what is invasion of privacy and what is not Apr 1, 2007 5:31:05 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: they will NOT instigate an investigation based solely upon your FB, i.e., they will not look for handbook violations to prosecute you for based just on facebook, but once the damage has been done, the PJB people at your trial may or may not have looked at FB Apr 1, 2007 5:31:09 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: brb Apr 1, 2007 5:31:35 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: k Apr 1, 2007 5:31:37 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i mean ill agree to an extent that they do have some rights to look at your FB since it is public (if you leave it public to them) but there are also some things that they shouldnt be allowed to prosecute you on Apr 1, 2007 5:32:11 PM EDT
CMC blue322: like Apr 1, 2007 5:32:20 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: loyola is a private institution, not a government Apr 1, 2007 5:32:23 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: the thing is that if you put it there it has the chance of being seen, and you've given up your right to privacy by putting it on the internet Apr 1, 2007 5:32:27 PM EDT
CMC blue322: its a loyola network Apr 1, 2007 5:32:40 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: back Apr 1, 2007 5:32:43 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: and youre on there as a Loyola student Apr 1, 2007 5:32:55 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its a network that allows people from many schools to join Apr 1, 2007 5:32:55 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its not run or funded by loyola Apr 1, 2007 5:33:02 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: yes but youre representing loyola Apr 1, 2007 5:33:06 PM EDT
CMC blue322: yes Apr 1, 2007 5:33:09 PM EDT
CMC blue322: exactly Apr 1, 2007 5:33:11 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: since loyola is a private institution and is not the US government, loyola does not have to answer to the same legal/constitutional constraints that the us govt. does Apr 1, 2007 5:33:11 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i understand that Apr 1, 2007 5:33:43 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its more of an issue with me of where they SHOULD draw the line Apr 1, 2007 5:33:52 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i understand their power Apr 1, 2007 5:33:54 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: exactly Apr 1, 2007 5:33:58 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: what they are and arent allowed to do Apr 1, 2007 5:33:58 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but is it really fair? Apr 1, 2007 5:34:03 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and they draw the line at not filtering through your facebook Apr 1, 2007 5:34:06 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: its fair Apr 1, 2007 5:34:14 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i guess when it all comes down to the wire im more or less arguing for a change in our society Apr 1, 2007 5:34:20 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: BUT they reserve the right to do it if it has to do with hate crimes, vandalism, or violence Apr 1, 2007 5:34:24 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: because you gave up the right to privacy when putting it public Apr 1, 2007 5:34:27 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: im just being an idealist here and a devils advocate Apr 1, 2007 5:34:48 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i think instead of using facebook to bust us, they should use it to protect us Apr 1, 2007 5:35:43 PM EDT
CMC blue322: how? Apr 1, 2007 5:35:51 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: school shootings, things of that nature Apr 1, 2007 5:36:02 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: how is FB gonna stop that? Apr 1, 2007 5:36:10 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: because some idiots post that shit up there Apr 1, 2007 5:36:20 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its happened with myspace and other public websites Apr 1, 2007 5:36:34 PM EDT
CMC blue322: more so on myspace Apr 1, 2007 5:36:37 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: exactly, they reserve the right to look at FB for hate crimes, vandalism, and violence Apr 1, 2007 5:36:38 PM EDT
CMC blue322: not as much facebook Apr 1, 2007 5:36:43 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: well we dont just have to talk about facebook Apr 1, 2007 5:37:03 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: afterall, this is a very open subject Apr 1, 2007 5:37:09 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and we dont just have to focus on loyola and FB Apr 1, 2007 5:37:15 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: ok lets just talk about the internet as a whole then Apr 1, 2007 5:37:16 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: should things you put on the internet be used in trials? Apr 1, 2007 5:37:28 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: depending on what they are and their relativity, yes Apr 1, 2007 5:37:40 PM EDT
CMC blue322: yeah i agree Apr 1, 2007 5:37:50 PM EDT
CMC blue322: they have to be relative to the case Apr 1, 2007 5:37:56 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: has anyone read the pillowman? Apr 1, 2007 5:38:03 PM EDT
CMC blue322: no Apr 1, 2007 5:38:05 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: if you write up a hitlist and post it on a website, sure you should be taken in Apr 1, 2007 5:38:09 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: well in the story this author writes stories about murders, and then the murders get committed Apr 1, 2007 5:38:29 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: should he be arrested? Apr 1, 2007 5:38:34 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: hahaha the pillowman Apr 1, 2007 5:38:36 PM EDT

CMC LoCoLady: just a very well read person ;-) Apr 1, 2007 5:39:05 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: the author admits to the murders in act 3 and then retracts his admissions at the end when he kills his brother Apr 1, 2007 5:39:09 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: right Apr 1, 2007 5:39:15 PM EDT

CMC blue322: the murderers said they did it bc of the book Apr 1, 2007 5:40:38 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: he wrote about the stories and his disturbed/mentally retarded brother read the stories and then enacted them Apr 1, 2007 5:40:47 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: they would probably investigate Apr 1, 2007 5:40:50 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: Ok im not saying to talk about the book Apr 1, 2007 5:40:59 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: Say Someone published stories online, that they wrote Apr 1, 2007 5:41:09 PM EDT

CMC LoCoLady: and the murders were committed, Apr 1, 2007 5:41:21 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but wait how does this all tie into privacy Apr 1, 2007 5:41:26 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: thats a matter of separating fact from fiction Apr 1, 2007 5:41:33 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: he published them on the internet Apr 1, 2007 5:41:36 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: we're talking about these things becoming public Apr 1, 2007 5:41:51 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: if you put some kind of disclaimer nothing can happen Apr 1, 2007 5:41:54 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: so is there still a connection to the author? Apr 1, 2007 5:42:04 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: a disclaimer saying "if these murders happen i didnt do it" Apr 1, 2007 5:42:16 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: well that wouldnt be the disclaimer Apr 1, 2007 5:42:27 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: that would just make it seem more suspicious Apr 1, 2007 5:42:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but if he told the readers that all of the storys were based on fictional events Apr 1, 2007 5:42:45 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i was being a bit facitious Apr 1, 2007 5:42:51 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: doesnt come off as well on the internet lol Apr 1, 2007 5:43:10 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: theres a fine line between an interesting read and being a crazed serial killer Apr 1, 2007 5:43:25 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: but if the murders happened after publication, do the cops have a right to question him Apr 1, 2007 5:43:28 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i would say no Apr 1, 2007 5:43:37 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i think theyy might question him bc of the similarity Apr 1, 2007 5:43:55 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: there are tons of storys out there about murder Apr 1, 2007 5:43:56 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: they would ask him if he knew anything about it Apr 1, 2007 5:44:08 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: im sure Apr 1, 2007 5:44:10 PM EDT
CMC blue322: yeah Apr 1, 2007 5:44:12 PM EDT
CMC blue322: or if there was anyone that paid special interest in his book Apr 1, 2007 5:44:28 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: hm Apr 1, 2007 5:44:46 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: so likewise Apr 1, 2007 5:44:54 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: well if this happened in our american system (and not the fictional one in the play) Apr 1, 2007 5:44:57 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: right Apr 1, 2007 5:45:00 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: the cops would have to bring the book to a judge as part of an argument for a warrant/summons for the author Apr 1, 2007 5:45:14 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and it would be up to the judge Apr 1, 2007 5:45:18 PM EDT
[Nicole Becker joined the session] Apr 1, 2007 5:45:37 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: HEY Apr 1, 2007 5:45:41 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: hi niki Apr 1, 2007 5:45:50 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and if the parallels are so close/eerie that it couldn't possibly be total coincidence, then the judge would likely say that it is suspicious enough to warrant a summons Apr 1, 2007 5:45:53 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: now if some guy wrote up a list and said "people who need to die" as the title, there might be a problem Apr 1, 2007 5:45:59 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: what if its not so blatant Apr 1, 2007 5:46:09 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but if that was in the public domain it would be admissable as evidence Apr 1, 2007 5:46:12 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: thats when its up to the judge to decide Apr 1, 2007 5:46:31 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: the prosecution would barely even have to worry about getting the evidence thrown out on the grounds of privacy Apr 1, 2007 5:46:34 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: we are talking about publicity not privacy here Apr 1, 2007 5:46:40 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i could make a post saying "i hate matt damon" or something Apr 1, 2007 5:46:45 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: anything public is public and works as evidence Apr 1, 2007 5:46:45 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: dont deal Apr 1, 2007 5:46:47 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: *done deal Apr 1, 2007 5:46:50 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: so what is private then in our day and age Apr 1, 2007 5:46:55 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: sure it can be interpreted as "i want to kill him" but then again... Apr 1, 2007 5:47:01 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: is anything really private today? Apr 1, 2007 5:47:13 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: thats where people have to draw the line Apr 1, 2007 5:47:17 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: not really Apr 1, 2007 5:47:19 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its kinda sad Apr 1, 2007 5:47:25 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: many things are reasonably private today yes Apr 1, 2007 5:47:31 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: even if not TOTALLY private Apr 1, 2007 5:47:36 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: such as? Apr 1, 2007 5:47:36 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: oh come on Apr 1, 2007 5:47:44 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: i dont prowl through your underwear drawer Apr 1, 2007 5:48:16 PM EDT
[Nicole Becker left the session] Apr 1, 2007 5:48:21 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: or does he.. Apr 1, 2007 5:48:25 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: there are no cameras in your bathroom Apr 1, 2007 5:48:26 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: unless you put them there yourself Apr 1, 2007 5:48:47 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: which doesnt seem like anybody would do that Apr 1, 2007 5:48:52 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: there are in some public bathrooms, as long as there are stalls (theres no camera in the stall) Apr 1, 2007 5:48:54 PM EDT
CMC blue322: theres a lot of llifetime movies where people install cameras into apartments they rent Apr 1, 2007 5:49:21 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: have i really added excitment? glad i could help Apr 1, 2007 5:49:23 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: what this is all boiling down to is the philosophical struggle between privacy and security Apr 1, 2007 5:49:24 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: whats more important Apr 1, 2007 5:49:33 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: er conceptual struggle Apr 1, 2007 5:49:34 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: safety Apr 1, 2007 5:49:34 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: or privacy Apr 1, 2007 5:49:41 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: personally i think my privacy is very important Apr 1, 2007 5:49:55 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i think both are equally important Apr 1, 2007 5:50:06 PM EDT
CMC blue322: yeah me too Apr 1, 2007 5:50:11 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i dont know about that Apr 1, 2007 5:50:17 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: while its nice to be able to be alone and do things that nobody else can know about... its also nice to not get shot everywhere Apr 1, 2007 5:50:29 PM EDT
CMC blue322: sometimes our privacy needs to be invaded for safety Apr 1, 2007 5:50:31 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: id rather be left to my own devices security wise and give me my privacy Apr 1, 2007 5:50:33 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i'll give you that Apr 1, 2007 5:50:41 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: your own devices Apr 1, 2007 5:51:17 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: ? Apr 1, 2007 5:51:18 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: so you would rather there are no police but you have your own bullet proof vest and gun to enact justice for yourself Apr 1, 2007 5:51:43 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: id rather have to deal with a lot of my own security, rather than having it done for me Apr 1, 2007 5:51:43 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: no Apr 1, 2007 5:51:47 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i said a lot Apr 1, 2007 5:51:51 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: not all Apr 1, 2007 5:51:52 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: privacy and security work in opposite ways Apr 1, 2007 5:51:55 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: LoCoLady: id rather be left to my own devices security wise and give me my privacy Apr 1, 2007 5:51:57 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: ? Apr 1, 2007 5:51:57 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: oh Apr 1, 2007 5:52:03 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: misworded my apologies Apr 1, 2007 5:52:05 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: if theres too much privacy people want more security Apr 1, 2007 5:52:11 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: viceversa Apr 1, 2007 5:52:14 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: or more commonly Apr 1, 2007 5:52:23 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: if theres not enough security people are often willing or forced to give up privacy Apr 1, 2007 5:52:39 PM EDT

CMC blue322: me? Apr 1, 2007 5:54:01 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: do you feel like you are in a private or public space Apr 1, 2007 5:54:04 PM EDT

CMC LoCoLady: not private at all Apr 1, 2007 5:54:12 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: far to easy to hack Apr 1, 2007 5:54:16 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: so you feel like anyone at all should be entitled to listen? Apr 1, 2007 5:54:19 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: private, but then again, to an extent Apr 1, 2007 5:54:19 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i think anything u say online can somehow be hacked into Apr 1, 2007 5:54:19 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: did you know that every single email that you have ever sent in your life is saved somewhere on the internet? Apr 1, 2007 5:54:43 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: like when we are in our discussion groups Apr 1, 2007 5:55:42 PM EDT

CMC ShoopDaWhoop: that this information was to be used for the study Apr 1, 2007 5:57:25 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: it means our name wont be connected to our data as such Apr 1, 2007 5:57:31 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: it was quaint and incomplete, but it basically pointed about identity disclosure Apr 1, 2007 5:57:35 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: yeah, consent form Apr 1, 2007 5:57:43 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: so if your identity wont be tied to your words here Apr 1, 2007 5:57:45 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: then do you feel like this is private or public and should people be able to listen Apr 1, 2007 5:58:01 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: but given the fact that you signed that form Apr 1, 2007 6:00:34 PM EDT

CMC LoCoLady: exactly Apr 1, 2007 6:05:44 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: it could very well have been justified Apr 1, 2007 6:05:45 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: the government NEEDS to know whats going on and what the peoples opinions are and congressional elections arent a totally adequate mechanism for doing so Apr 1, 2007 6:07:40 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: so wiretapping/human asset sourcing could be good ways of linking the minds at the "top" with intel/ideas/opinions/data from the "bottom" Apr 1, 2007 6:08:04 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: agreed Apr 1, 2007 6:08:09 PM EDT

CMC LoCoLady: emotional Apr 1, 2007 6:09:47 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: we live in an executive age when executive orders transcend most judicial scrutiny, the agency and the NSA lie under the executive branch dont they! Apr 1, 2007 6:09:50 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: territorial what have you Apr 1, 2007 6:09:53 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: they should have to have some kind of guidelines for what they can arrest you for when they tap Apr 1, 2007 6:10:03 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: or what can be brought up in court Apr 1, 2007 6:10:17 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: wel taps havent led to many arrests, have they? or have they and we just dont know about it Apr 1, 2007 6:10:19 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: either way tapping like that is dangerous ground to dread Apr 1, 2007 6:10:25 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: *tread Apr 1, 2007 6:10:28 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: if they say that its to root out the terrorists and then arrest you for trying to buy some weed, thats kinda not cool Apr 1, 2007 6:10:31 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: well i dont think they could do that Apr 1, 2007 6:10:42 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but remember they dont lie under judicial scrutiny Apr 1, 2007 6:10:48 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but they could Apr 1, 2007 6:10:50 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i dont think they have Apr 1, 2007 6:10:51 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: for the most part Apr 1, 2007 6:10:51 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: they havent but theyve induced this fear in everybody that they're listening in Apr 1, 2007 6:11:10 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: now everybody is on edge Apr 1, 2007 6:11:17 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: well, not everybody Apr 1, 2007 6:11:20 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i think the avg americcan doesnt even think about it Apr 1, 2007 6:11:32 PM EDT
