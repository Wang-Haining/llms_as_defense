Nicole Becker: okay your first topic is gay marriage May 1, 2007 9:35:05 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: In Maryland a conservative legislator said he backs a bill that would put an amendment on the ballot. THe amendment to the state constitution would define marriage to be between a man and a woman. Also 16 states have enacted bans on gays adopting children. May 1, 2007 9:35:15 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: thoughts? May 1, 2007 9:35:21 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: I cant see a reason why gay people should not be able to be married May 1, 2007 9:35:50 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: i think a loving gay couple is way more fit to have an adopted child then a shitty marriage between a man and a women May 1, 2007 9:36:13 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: definitly May 1, 2007 9:36:19 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: it doesn't seem to effect the state at all if gay marriages were legal May 1, 2007 9:36:53 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: religion aside, marriage is a ceremony in which a man and woman stand up in front of their friends and family and publicily say tht they love eachother. why not the same with two men or two women? May 1, 2007 9:37:17 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: if anything it would benefit our government May 1, 2007 9:37:45 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: it seems so many people are for gay marriage May 1, 2007 9:38:08 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea but by so many people you mean so many people from the east and west and not even majarities in those areas... the midwest and south are another story May 1, 2007 9:39:15 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: true May 1, 2007 9:39:28 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: but it doesn't affect them May 1, 2007 9:39:45 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: it just makes them uncomfortable May 1, 2007 9:39:52 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: exactly May 1, 2007 9:40:01 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well as far as the seperation of church and state issue, i think the state's definition of marriage should be made without any church's (catholic or otherwise) input May 1, 2007 9:40:16 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea i totally agree about that May 1, 2007 9:40:31 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: same May 1, 2007 9:40:35 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: it's time that the united states recognizes the wants of this community of people May 1, 2007 9:40:38 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: agreed May 1, 2007 9:40:42 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i just can't think of any reason for not having gay marriages become legal May 1, 2007 9:41:15 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: so even if a catholic (like me) sees the *sacrament* of marriage as a man and woman, i dont see why other people cant have a ceremony and call it the same thing May 1, 2007 9:41:28 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: we're not saying the church has to chnage their ideas May 1, 2007 9:41:28 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i dont think the country is that stupid where we can't differentiate the tow May 1, 2007 9:41:52 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: see i hate that the catholic church even comes in to play here May 1, 2007 9:41:58 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: Also if gay marraige was legal the goverment could tax them, and make more revenue. May 1, 2007 9:42:01 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: and to call it anythign other than a marriage is direspecting the community more May 1, 2007 9:42:02 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: ? May 1, 2007 9:42:03 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: why May 1, 2007 9:42:05 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: how many gay men and women are catholic in this country May 1, 2007 9:42:10 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: yea May 1, 2007 9:42:15 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: ? May 1, 2007 9:42:18 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: unless its 100% then it shouldnt matter May 1, 2007 9:42:19 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: huh? May 1, 2007 9:42:30 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well thats not very intelligent May 1, 2007 9:42:34 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: im saying a gay jew is confined by the lack of separation of church and state May 1, 2007 9:42:57 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: is that right? May 1, 2007 9:43:02 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i mean, one of the main talking points is society with this issue is the catholics anal retentive way of saying "the bible defines marriage as..." where other religions just don't give a %^&* May 1, 2007 9:43:29 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: why what are jews policy? the same as catholic? May 1, 2007 9:43:29 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: couldn't tell you May 1, 2007 9:43:37 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i dont know May 1, 2007 9:43:41 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: not sure i am pretty sure orthodox jews are like catholics May 1, 2007 9:44:01 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: * aforementioned catholics being the "bad" ones May 1, 2007 9:44:01 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i would guess, yea May 1, 2007 9:44:09 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: yeah May 1, 2007 9:44:15 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: there do exist christian sects that allow gay marriages May 1, 2007 9:44:32 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: which ones? May 1, 2007 9:44:50 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: not sure, it came up in the group discussions May 1, 2007 9:45:07 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: ahh gotya May 1, 2007 9:45:12 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: one person was from a religion where it was acceptable May 1, 2007 9:45:18 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: christian religion May 1, 2007 9:45:22 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: that's interesting May 1, 2007 9:45:29 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i thought so May 1, 2007 9:45:34 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: i just think that this goes back to what we were talking about that the church needs to change. this would almost force them to think about changing their ways May 1, 2007 9:45:51 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: although some fundamentalist christians and catholics aren't exactly on the same page May 1, 2007 9:45:53 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: lo May 1, 2007 9:45:55 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: l May 1, 2007 9:45:57 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: well how can a christian religion allow it and not the united states? May 1, 2007 9:46:06 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: ...because of the seperation of church and state? May 1, 2007 9:46:23 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i dunno May 1, 2007 9:46:25 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: that seems ridicuolous May 1, 2007 9:46:28 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: haha May 1, 2007 9:46:30 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i know May 1, 2007 9:46:34 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: ha May 1, 2007 9:46:37 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well i think we're all agreed on the ridiculous-ness of the argument May 1, 2007 9:46:48 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: about adoptiing children... May 1, 2007 9:47:01 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: hm May 1, 2007 9:47:06 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i dont see any reason not to allow that either May 1, 2007 9:47:12 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: i am all for adopting children also May 1, 2007 9:47:19 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well i just think it's interesting May 1, 2007 9:47:26 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: love is love May 1, 2007 9:47:29 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: yea May 1, 2007 9:47:31 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: same. there are some people who make terrible parents even though they are in a man woman couple May 1, 2007 9:47:33 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: right May 1, 2007 9:47:39 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: if one family can't give it to them, why not let another May 1, 2007 9:47:43 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: exactly May 1, 2007 9:48:01 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: especially when we have children is the world who dont have homes May 1, 2007 9:48:04 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: cause if you think about it, adoption is the main way a gay couple would get children May 1, 2007 9:48:05 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yes besides artifical insemination May 1, 2007 9:48:15 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: what about man/man? May 1, 2007 9:48:28 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: surrogate mother May 1, 2007 9:48:34 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yeah May 1, 2007 9:48:35 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: and if it is a proven fact that its biological or gentic why should they be kept from raising a child May 1, 2007 9:48:36 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea May 1, 2007 9:48:37 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: thats just creepy May 1, 2007 9:48:40 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: lol May 1, 2007 9:48:42 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: thats not even a gay issue May 1, 2007 9:48:49 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: well yeah but if it was the only way that they could have children May 1, 2007 9:48:55 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: surrogate mothers freak me out May 1, 2007 9:48:56 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: straight couples use them if they cant have children May 1, 2007 9:49:05 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i know, thats why i said it wasn't even a gay issue May 1, 2007 9:49:17 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: i guess its some what related May 1, 2007 9:49:29 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: straight mothers use sperm banks too May 1, 2007 9:49:30 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yeah May 1, 2007 9:49:35 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: ... May 1, 2007 9:51:00 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: soo May 1, 2007 9:51:02 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: whats up May 1, 2007 9:51:06 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: uhm what about the fact that it is being proven biological or genetic... May 1, 2007 9:52:41 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: what do you mean May 1, 2007 9:53:13 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well the genetic thing is interesting, but the "frogs are gay" argument is stupid May 1, 2007 9:53:18 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: homosexuality in animals does exist, but some animals also eat their own shit May 1, 2007 9:53:42 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: whats that? May 1, 2007 9:53:48 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: humans are on a different plane May 1, 2007 9:54:01 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: and throw it May 1, 2007 9:54:03 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: haha, exactly May 1, 2007 9:54:09 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: i think that if being gay was found to be biological there would be hard for the government to deny them rights May 1, 2007 9:55:39 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: is there any other area of this topic that need discussed May 1, 2007 9:55:46 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: good point xyz May 1, 2007 9:56:15 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: yea nicole, are we good? any other talking points May 1, 2007 9:56:25 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: i agree if it is all nature and no nurture then it should be legal May 1, 2007 9:56:28 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: how do you think the catholic church would react to it if gay marraige was found to be biological? May 1, 2007 9:56:32 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well, hopefully theyd change their views May 1, 2007 9:56:45 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: i would hope so... but who knows May 1, 2007 9:56:53 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: they would be hard pressed too to accept gay marriage into their community but i still feel as though they would be hard to change May 1, 2007 9:56:56 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: they might blaim the parents May 1, 2007 9:56:59 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well just cause its biological doesnt mean anything May 1, 2007 9:57:17 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: a lot of them already accept that, and say it's a 'disease' May 1, 2007 9:57:31 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: like colorblindness May 1, 2007 9:57:46 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: but if it is something that cant be changed thats like saying you cant get married if your colorblind May 1, 2007 9:57:56 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea exactly and as long as it is looked as a negative in any way then it will not be allowed May 1, 2007 9:58:03 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well their argument is: May 1, 2007 9:58:15 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: god has given you a difficult cross to bear, so if you aren't attracted to the opposite sex than you are destined for a life of chastity May 1, 2007 9:58:56 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: or to go into the priesthood May 1, 2007 9:59:05 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: which, as we know, has yielded some awful circumstances May 1, 2007 9:59:30 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yes May 1, 2007 9:59:39 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: good point May 1, 2007 10:00:10 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: right and i dont believe that the church thinks he would jst do that May 1, 2007 10:00:22 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: God i mean lol May 1, 2007 10:00:33 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: that is if it proven genetic May 1, 2007 10:00:42 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: wait whats up? May 1, 2007 10:00:48 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: can you clarify that May 1, 2007 10:00:52 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: yeah May 1, 2007 10:02:26 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: uhm May 1, 2007 10:02:29 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: how can the church say we cant except the lifestyle of people when they were created that way May 1, 2007 10:02:55 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: by and all knowing all loving God May 1, 2007 10:03:04 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: they just do, the church does a lot of things without to much reason these days May 1, 2007 10:03:28 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: i think we have discussed this in other chats May 1, 2007 10:03:36 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well why are some people born with birth defects? May 1, 2007 10:03:51 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: thats what they think May 1, 2007 10:03:56 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: its some kind of birth defect May 1, 2007 10:04:03 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea i know May 1, 2007 10:04:13 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: but the church doesnt say that you arent allowed to get married if you are born with only one hand May 1, 2007 10:04:33 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: right May 1, 2007 10:04:47 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: but it does say you have to get married to a member of the other sex May 1, 2007 10:05:02 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: or be alone essentially or chose a lifestyle seperate from what u want May 1, 2007 10:05:05 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i agree its unfair, but im just trying to defend them for the sake of the discussion May 1, 2007 10:05:51 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: well i dont know if we will ever change the church's mind on this issue, but if they are worried about losing following this issue, if legalized by the United States, could cause alot of problems May 1, 2007 10:05:53 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: which brings back the point that where does the catholic church come in to play in our countrys legislation May 1, 2007 10:06:04 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: that i agree May 1, 2007 10:06:05 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: and if we are going along with separation of church and state then the church should have no say in any government decisions May 1, 2007 10:06:35 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: agreed May 1, 2007 10:06:51 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: very good point May 1, 2007 10:07:11 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: yeah May 1, 2007 10:07:57 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: so then its the govenments move and they should not take the church's feelings into consideration May 1, 2007 10:08:00 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yes May 1, 2007 10:08:11 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: which should lead them to legalize marriage...bc i see no reason that would hold them back otherwise May 1, 2007 10:09:10 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: exactly May 1, 2007 10:09:19 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yep May 1, 2007 10:09:58 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: yea, ive run out of defensive manuveurs for them lol May 1, 2007 10:10:03 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: nicole? May 1, 2007 10:10:36 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: sorry May 1, 2007 10:11:03 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: i'm trying to figure out roughly how long this is May 1, 2007 10:11:14 PM EDT

Nicole Becker: okay I guess we can move on to the next topic May 1, 2007 10:11:29 PM EDT
