Melissa Carbone: ok your 1st topic is gay marriage Mar 18, 2007 4:09:56 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: any thoughts? Mar 18, 2007 4:09:59 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: ... Mar 18, 2007 4:10:18 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i don't have any problems with it. Mar 18, 2007 4:10:19 PM EDT
CMC dah88: eh, i do Mar 18, 2007 4:10:27 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: ? Mar 18, 2007 4:10:36 PM EDT
CMC dah88: only when they call it marriage Mar 18, 2007 4:10:36 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i'm back and forth Mar 18, 2007 4:10:40 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: ME TOO! Mar 18, 2007 4:10:42 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that's how i feel also Mar 18, 2007 4:10:47 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: por que? Mar 18, 2007 4:10:49 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean, just call it a union and the church has nothing to do with it Mar 18, 2007 4:11:05 PM EDT
CMC dah88: marriage is strictly one man one woman, i don't see a problem with a gay couple though Mar 18, 2007 4:11:11 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think the marriage part is a call for religions to make Mar 18, 2007 4:11:11 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Mar 18, 2007 4:11:15 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Mar 18, 2007 4:11:15 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but i dont see a reason why they cant be legally married Mar 18, 2007 4:11:29 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: different religions can make the call on whether they'll recognize it or not Mar 18, 2007 4:11:50 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: they can, just don't call it a marriage, call it something else Mar 18, 2007 4:11:51 PM EDT
CMC dah88: if a gay couple wants to be recognized by the state as a couple i think thats okay too just not a married couple Mar 18, 2007 4:11:52 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Mar 18, 2007 4:11:56 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i agree Mar 18, 2007 4:12:13 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: it's not totally accepted by society now either, so i think calling it a marriage right away would piss some people off Mar 18, 2007 4:13:03 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: frogger? Mar 18, 2007 4:13:17 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Mar 18, 2007 4:13:17 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Mar 18, 2007 4:13:21 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, my thing is this: a marriage license is something you apply for from the government. it's a completely secular process. i don't see any reason for them to change the wording, unless they're going to change it for everyone. churches are completely free to have a different definition for marriage if they want (most people have different definitions for things than the government anyway). Mar 18, 2007 4:13:25 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: whoa Mar 18, 2007 4:13:27 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lemme read all that Mar 18, 2007 4:13:33 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: haha, sho nuff Mar 18, 2007 4:13:38 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: true Mar 18, 2007 4:14:07 PM EDT
CMC dah88: well, when i hear marriage i think of the sacramen not being recognized as a couple by the state or govt Mar 18, 2007 4:14:19 PM EDT
CMC dah88: sacrament* Mar 18, 2007 4:14:25 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right, but that's a religious definition. when the government recognizes a person's marriage with a license, though, that's different Mar 18, 2007 4:15:03 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, i mean marriage is more of a church thing than gov't. thing....(WE HAD IT FIRST! lol) Mar 18, 2007 4:15:20 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and "marriage" according to the government carried more benefits and rights than civil unions Mar 18, 2007 4:15:34 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i guess - for me as a catholic however - thats what i think of, so thats just my take on it Mar 18, 2007 4:15:40 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: likewise Mar 18, 2007 4:15:48 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but even if i wasn't a catholic, i think i'd still have the same opinion on it Mar 18, 2007 4:16:14 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i'm a catholic too, but my problem with not calling it a marriage is that the semantics involved seem to imply that it's a second-rate institution, which isn't fair Mar 18, 2007 4:16:30 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: the words we use for something make a big difference in people's perceptions of a thing Mar 18, 2007 4:16:48 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats true Mar 18, 2007 4:16:53 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: what is your view lilstanemone Mar 18, 2007 4:17:07 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and the word makes a big difference in a legal sense too Mar 18, 2007 4:17:07 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: true too Mar 18, 2007 4:17:21 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yes, however i think for a gay marriage since it is and has not been the norm should change what they call it Mar 18, 2007 4:17:54 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: civil unions don't have the same rights as marriages - and i think it doesn't matter what churches choose to do, but legally gay couples deserve the same rights as heterosexual couples Mar 18, 2007 4:17:57 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i agrree Mar 18, 2007 4:18:07 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think they should just use a different word for marriage, maybe to just humor the catholics! Mar 18, 2007 4:18:35 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha Mar 18, 2007 4:19:04 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: marriage isn't "sacred" only because it's a thing within the church, the reason people see it in a way that noone wants to change it is because that's what most people in history have percieved it as Mar 18, 2007 4:19:19 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: did that make sense? Mar 18, 2007 4:19:23 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i just think not calling it marriage would ease alot of tensions Mar 18, 2007 4:19:24 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i think that when you argue that we should postpone giving them those same rights, even if only in a semantic sense, you're marginalizing them Mar 18, 2007 4:19:31 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: easing tensions is fine, but people argued that easing tensions was a good reason for postponing civil rights in the 60s, too Mar 18, 2007 4:20:08 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think the gov't. gives more rights to heterosexual couples because it helps out our society on a financial basis Mar 18, 2007 4:20:13 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think the only reason marriage is sacred because it is within the church, the church doesnt even recognize marriages that dont take place within the church Mar 18, 2007 4:20:15 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: or they could give more rights to people in civil unions, and wait for religions to sort out their take on everything Mar 18, 2007 4:20:30 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i agree on that Mar 18, 2007 4:20:44 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, at the end of the day, the churches aren't the ones passing legislation, though Mar 18, 2007 4:21:11 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: what are the main "rights" that you guys are focussing on? Mar 18, 2007 4:21:21 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: it does help society out financially, but gay couples contribute to society in the same ways straight couples do so they deserve all the same breaks Mar 18, 2007 4:21:39 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: sorry, that was way late lol Mar 18, 2007 4:21:55 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: it's all good Mar 18, 2007 4:22:01 PM EDT
CMC dah88: true but why should it be all about the govt? why should the church have to recognize these unions Mar 18, 2007 4:22:05 PM EDT
CMC dah88: so was mine lol Mar 18, 2007 4:22:25 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well Mar 18, 2007 4:22:26 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: marriage was within the church, and when church and state united a long time ago, the state took that within itself Mar 18, 2007 4:23:02 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: they don't, churches have all the right in the world to not recognize gay couples as members, if thats what they really want to do Mar 18, 2007 4:23:10 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that's why i think that "marriage" should stay within the church, and for the gov't. to call it something else Mar 18, 2007 4:23:32 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Mar 18, 2007 4:23:48 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well then they should come up with a legal word for marriage and apply it to all couples getting married Mar 18, 2007 4:24:05 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but why? Mar 18, 2007 4:24:15 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and the church can continue to use marriage Mar 18, 2007 4:24:16 PM EDT
CMC dah88: o ok Mar 18, 2007 4:24:20 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: totally agree Mar 18, 2007 4:24:33 PM EDT
CMC dah88: agreed Mar 18, 2007 4:24:37 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean, that's not looking down on anybody Mar 18, 2007 4:24:46 PM EDT
CMC dah88: no Mar 18, 2007 4:24:53 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: as long as the same word applies to hetero and homosexual couples, i'd be ok with it Mar 18, 2007 4:25:02 PM EDT
CMC dah88: exactly Mar 18, 2007 4:25:15 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: so you're saying that the govn't would recognize EVERYONE with a certain term who is together, but marriage would only apply to couples within the church? Mar 18, 2007 4:25:44 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: just making sure i have it right Mar 18, 2007 4:25:51 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, yes, that'd be fine; my problem would be with the government using two different terms, which encourages marginalization Mar 18, 2007 4:25:51 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats what i was thinking, yeah Mar 18, 2007 4:26:07 PM EDT
CMC dah88: woah what lol Mar 18, 2007 4:26:24 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i dont think the gov has to use to terms Mar 18, 2007 4:26:41 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: who cares? Mar 18, 2007 4:26:42 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean Mar 18, 2007 4:26:43 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: so what if "marriage" only applies to catholics, or others within the church Mar 18, 2007 4:27:01 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, "churches", plural Mar 18, 2007 4:27:22 PM EDT
CMC dah88: why cant the church use marriage reffering to their members and the state use somethin else for everyone Mar 18, 2007 4:27:27 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: it's not like people will hate catholics or vice versa Mar 18, 2007 4:27:27 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Mar 18, 2007 4:27:34 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Mar 18, 2007 4:27:41 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, that would be acceptable Mar 18, 2007 4:27:46 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: what do you guys feel about an amendment banning gay marriage Mar 18, 2007 4:28:09 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i think it's a stupid political contrivance to galvanize the republican base Mar 18, 2007 4:28:29 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well, banning gay MARRIAGE i'm totally cool with Mar 18, 2007 4:28:35 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think the gov is being influenced way to much by religion Mar 18, 2007 4:28:36 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think it's totally uncalled for Mar 18, 2007 4:28:37 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: no, they shouldn't be able to ban marriage Mar 18, 2007 4:28:52 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right i agree with the marriage part Mar 18, 2007 4:28:56 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: even as a church term Mar 18, 2007 4:28:57 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: that should be up to the churches Mar 18, 2007 4:29:06 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: just change the word like we were saying for everyone in general, and that amendment won't make a difference Mar 18, 2007 4:29:08 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think if they do what we just agreed on - calling it somethin else- then gays could still "get married" just use a different term Mar 18, 2007 4:29:31 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Mar 18, 2007 4:29:35 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah but -- Mar 18, 2007 4:29:41 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i think it's another karl rove-esque political move. the administration only cares about it as a point of leverage to garner support Mar 18, 2007 4:29:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: keep in mind that our country is based on religion Mar 18, 2007 4:29:52 PM EDT
CMC dah88: well we know already that the church bands gay marriage Mar 18, 2007 4:29:53 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: they want to ban the idea of gays living together in a legal way similar to marriage Mar 18, 2007 4:30:06 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: so why wouldn't they just put a ban on the new term for it Mar 18, 2007 4:30:17 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: ? Mar 18, 2007 4:30:18 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i would disagree with the statement that our gov't is based on religion, too Mar 18, 2007 4:30:24 PM EDT
CMC dah88: they shouldnt i disagree with them doing that Mar 18, 2007 4:30:32 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: how is it not?????? Mar 18, 2007 4:30:33 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: are you kidding me? Mar 18, 2007 4:30:36 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well that's pretty much what they're trying to do Mar 18, 2007 4:30:56 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i agree Mar 18, 2007 4:31:06 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: most of the founding fathers were deists, and if you read their personal writings closely they favored a secular veiw of a democratic republican system Mar 18, 2007 4:31:08 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: *view Mar 18, 2007 4:31:14 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: a government ban on gay marriage isn't leaving it to the churches Mar 18, 2007 4:31:17 PM EDT
CMC dah88: thats if we leave it as marriage Mar 18, 2007 4:31:31 PM EDT
CMC dah88: the work must be changed Mar 18, 2007 4:31:35 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right, and amendments are generally reserved for serious constitutional changes, not legislative stunts Mar 18, 2007 4:31:47 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i agree Mar 18, 2007 4:32:09 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yea Mar 18, 2007 4:32:22 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: true Mar 18, 2007 4:32:36 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: does anybody have any personal experiences with this, like talking to other gay people about it? Mar 18, 2007 4:33:32 PM EDT
CMC dah88: nope Mar 18, 2007 4:33:42 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i'm in the dark on this one too Mar 18, 2007 4:33:48 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: a little Mar 18, 2007 4:33:51 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, i have a gay cousin and a few gay friends Mar 18, 2007 4:33:52 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: expand then Mar 18, 2007 4:33:58 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (trying to keep the conversation going...lol) Mar 18, 2007 4:34:15 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i had a gay friend in high school, and i know he wanted to get married someday and have a family Mar 18, 2007 4:34:23 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: ik lol good job Mar 18, 2007 4:34:30 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (yesss) Mar 18, 2007 4:34:42 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, most of them want to be able to get married in my experience, obviously Mar 18, 2007 4:34:45 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i see no problem with your friend wanting to live a normal life like that Mar 18, 2007 4:34:59 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and there shouldn't be Mar 18, 2007 4:35:07 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yep Mar 18, 2007 4:35:12 PM EDT
CMC dah88: so we all agree just to change the word marriage? Mar 18, 2007 4:35:33 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i don't mean to sound like a girl, but everybody want's loooooove, that's what humans do Mar 18, 2007 4:35:50 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that was totally late also Mar 18, 2007 4:35:54 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i just mean, it's one thing if he can't get married in the church, but another for the government to say "no, you aren't a real couple" Mar 18, 2007 4:35:59 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: from a legal and governmental perspective, i'd go for it Mar 18, 2007 4:36:00 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah, change the word Mar 18, 2007 4:36:14 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Mar 18, 2007 4:36:16 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i agree Mar 18, 2007 4:36:18 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: that would make a lot of people feel better, i think, and right now some sort of compromise has to happen Mar 18, 2007 4:36:38 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: you mean change the word for only the government, right? Mar 18, 2007 4:36:47 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well yeah, you can't tell the church what to do Mar 18, 2007 4:37:02 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Mar 18, 2007 4:37:03 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: ok, right Mar 18, 2007 4:37:10 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i'm not saying we should change the name of a holy sacrament lol Mar 18, 2007 4:37:23 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i think that right now the issue isn't being given a fair shake as an issue in itself, though; it's being used as a social wedge. politicians are using it more as a tool to divide and conquer Mar 18, 2007 4:37:23 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats true, they try to stir up emotion over it on purpose Mar 18, 2007 4:37:48 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: can you go into some more detail witht hat? Mar 18, 2007 4:38:02 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i agree on that Mar 18, 2007 4:38:09 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, look at the last presidential elections (gimme a minute) Mar 18, 2007 4:38:19 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: can you expand on your views a little too DAH? Mar 18, 2007 4:38:51 PM EDT
CMC dah88: politicians are being supportive of it or not supportive based on where they need votes - i think Mar 18, 2007 4:38:51 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: melissa, are we allowed to use like the internet here, or no? Mar 18, 2007 4:38:58 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think so too Mar 18, 2007 4:39:10 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: you mean to look something up right now? Mar 18, 2007 4:39:14 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: for future reference, yeah Mar 18, 2007 4:39:25 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: i think that would be ok because in a normal chat room you would be able to Mar 18, 2007 4:39:44 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: ok, thanks Mar 18, 2007 4:39:51 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: good question Mar 18, 2007 4:40:12 PM EDT
CMC dah88: politicians are also siding with celebrities like rosie odonnell to gain support of fans Mar 18, 2007 4:40:24 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i don't think that politicians are necessarily doing it only for the vote, i mean, the people who get that high up are VERY opinionated on everything, so they already have their opinions basically set in stone Mar 18, 2007 4:40:31 PM EDT
CMC dah88: true but they also want to go higher and they want the vote Mar 18, 2007 4:40:56 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah, but they know how strongly to push an issue based on public opinion Mar 18, 2007 4:40:59 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i don't follow that rosie crap, but what politicians are with her? Mar 18, 2007 4:41:01 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: in a few midwestern states, local republican party members lobbied to have a gay marriage referendum on the ballot; in the states where that happened, that encouraged a larger portion of voters to turn out to vote against the referendum. that's what many really were encouraged to come to the polls by, and it just so happened that they also voted republican when it came to the candidates. that's an example of it being used as a political tool Mar 18, 2007 4:41:14 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (dah, they're not gonna just change their views like that....people'd call them out on that) Mar 18, 2007 4:41:20 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: wow Mar 18, 2007 4:41:50 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: hahah, i think you're giving politicians too much credit when you say they don't change their minds. anybody follow hillary? Mar 18, 2007 4:41:58 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i mean just her views Mar 18, 2007 4:42:11 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats actually pretty devious if the politicians had that in mind when they put out the referendum Mar 18, 2007 4:42:33 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and i'm sure they did Mar 18, 2007 4:42:43 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: probably Mar 18, 2007 4:42:50 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: no, i don't follow hillary so much... Mar 18, 2007 4:43:01 PM EDT

CMC dah88: I see no problem with it Mar 18, 2007 4:45:03 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yep Mar 18, 2007 4:45:07 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i'm cool with it, but you do need to keep in mind that those kids will possibly have a rough time growing up Mar 18, 2007 4:45:10 PM EDT
CMC dah88: agreed Mar 18, 2007 4:45:12 PM EDT

CMC littlestanemone: having divorced parents used to bring gossip too Mar 18, 2007 4:46:28 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: now, it's not unusual at all Mar 18, 2007 4:46:37 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well i meant have the discrimination involving gays since his parents are Mar 18, 2007 4:46:41 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, and i think that that's a social change that's happening right now Mar 18, 2007 4:46:49 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but homosexually is a part of socriety, they will eventually come in contact with it Mar 18, 2007 4:46:54 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: (people becoming more sensitive about it, i mean) Mar 18, 2007 4:47:02 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Mar 18, 2007 4:47:06 PM EDT

CMC dah88: but it is not my place to say that they cannot be who they are Mar 18, 2007 4:48:10 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: no, i know Mar 18, 2007 4:48:16 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i guess just homosexuality in general Mar 18, 2007 4:48:19 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: there's things that gross me out a lot worse than the thought of two men or women being together Mar 18, 2007 4:48:36 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats just me though Mar 18, 2007 4:49:03 PM EDT

CMC John_Bastow: what do you mean by "society wise?" Mar 18, 2007 4:50:04 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think in 100 years noone will be grossed out by it, because it will have been in the open and everything longer Mar 18, 2007 4:50:42 PM EDT
CMC dah88: littlestanemone said that there are alot more things that gross her out so i said well on the topic of society, i think only a man and a woman shuold be together Mar 18, 2007 4:50:42 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right, we are in a transition process with this issue Mar 18, 2007 4:51:05 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i don't really have any issues with it, to be honest. a lot of research seems to indicate that it's not a "lifestyle choice" so much as a genetic disposition. Mar 18, 2007 4:51:18 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: oh boy - nature vs. nurture Mar 18, 2007 4:51:33 PM EDT

CMC dah88: not sure Mar 18, 2007 4:52:20 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, no, but recent scientific research in animal groups indicates that it's a predisposition Mar 18, 2007 4:52:32 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think environment deffinitly has something to do with it though Mar 18, 2007 4:52:34 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: it's a little nature and a little nurture i think Mar 18, 2007 4:52:34 PM EDT
CMC dah88: same Mar 18, 2007 4:52:39 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: ok, my neighbor has to turn out gay when he's older Mar 18, 2007 4:52:41 PM EDT

CMC littlestanemone: well, animals do a lot of things differently than we do though Mar 18, 2007 4:54:28 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: what does everyone think about same sex coupling in animals Mar 18, 2007 4:54:43 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right, but the general layout of their brains is basically the same as ours Mar 18, 2007 4:54:47 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: the way our minds work adds a whole other dimension to all of our life choices Mar 18, 2007 4:54:48 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: as related to our topic Mar 18, 2007 4:54:48 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right, but we still have instinctual predispositions Mar 18, 2007 4:55:02 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: two totally things Mar 18, 2007 4:55:17 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: which dictate much of our conscious activity, like it or not Mar 18, 2007 4:55:20 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: plus Mar 18, 2007 4:55:20 PM EDT

CMC dah88: has anyone ever witnessed discrimination against gays? Mar 18, 2007 4:57:04 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: salgood. but the point is that some theories hold that it's a biological kick-in among dense populations; it brings down the population size Mar 18, 2007 4:57:06 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: and yeah Mar 18, 2007 4:57:14 PM EDT
