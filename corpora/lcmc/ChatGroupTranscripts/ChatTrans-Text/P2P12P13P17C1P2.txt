Nicole Becker: okay, the next topic is privacy rights, so here's another little story to get you started. Mar 21, 2007 7:50:03 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: The NSA has a database of millions of calls made by US citizens. The new survey (released this week) found that 63 percent of Americans said they found the NSA program to be an acceptable way to investigate terrorism, including 44 percent who strongly endorsed the effort. Another 35 percent said the program was unacceptable, which included 24 percent who strongly objected to it. Mar 21, 2007 7:50:04 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i think it's okay, because they are using it for a good reason Mar 21, 2007 7:50:35 PM EDT
CMC rocks: and without it, who knows what could have happened? Mar 21, 2007 7:50:46 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: As long as they don't use any information collected for any other reason besides terrorism, I think that is fine. Mar 21, 2007 7:51:01 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: There's a problem you hit when people become "paranoid." Mar 21, 2007 7:51:12 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i agree with that...i have nothing to hide and don't really care if they scan my calls Mar 21, 2007 7:51:18 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: The F.B.I. showed up at a high school because of a comment a girl made on her myspace page. Mar 21, 2007 7:51:44 PM EDT
CMC rocks: really? Mar 21, 2007 7:52:10 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: I don't remember when, but I read it in the newspaper a few months ago. Mar 21, 2007 7:52:10 PM EDT
CMC rocks: lol Mar 21, 2007 7:52:12 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well myspace is public information. Mar 21, 2007 7:52:15 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i think that was one of the things that was in all our prompts Mar 21, 2007 7:52:24 PM EDT
CMC rocks: or was that a school official got the person in trouble? Mar 21, 2007 7:52:36 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: A school shooting was prevented Mar 21, 2007 7:52:54 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: I don't recall reading a prompt. Mar 21, 2007 7:52:56 PM EDT
CMC rocks: remember when we had to write about these topics? Mar 21, 2007 7:53:12 PM EDT
CMC rocks: that's what i'm referring to Mar 21, 2007 7:53:18 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Oh, I haven't blogged yet. Mar 21, 2007 7:53:23 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (that was for part 1... not everybody participated last semester) Mar 21, 2007 7:53:25 PM EDT
CMC rocks: okay Mar 21, 2007 7:53:30 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Ah. Mar 21, 2007 7:53:32 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: so back to the topic... Mar 21, 2007 7:53:54 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Right. Mar 21, 2007 7:54:01 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Yeah, I don't have a problem with the NSA gathering that information. It depends on how they use it, however. Mar 21, 2007 7:54:22 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well i think anyone who would go through the trouble of collecting all that information would probably have something useful to do with it Mar 21, 2007 7:54:53 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: If they say they are collecting it for a certain noble cause, like the prevention of terrorism, I am okay with it. As long as that information has no chance of going public, and will not be used for any other purpose. Mar 21, 2007 7:55:48 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so in essence we're really talking about the patriot act here? Mar 21, 2007 7:56:02 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Well, how sure can anyone be that this information will be kept secure? Mar 21, 2007 7:56:15 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well, privacy rights in general. Like Loyola using Facebook, for instance. Mar 21, 2007 7:56:38 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i think that's in the provisions of the patriot act....that this information will only be used for the purposes of preventing terrorism Mar 21, 2007 7:56:45 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i agree with that Mar 21, 2007 7:57:06 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well then I am okay with it. I will give up some of my rights for a greater cause. Mar 21, 2007 7:57:18 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i just looked it up on widipedia (reliable?) and it says the patriot act is only for terrorism purposes Mar 21, 2007 7:57:54 PM EDT
CMC rocks: in which case i think it is a good idea and necessary Mar 21, 2007 7:58:06 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Is anyone against the patriot act? Mar 21, 2007 7:58:29 PM EDT
CMC rocks: no Mar 21, 2007 7:59:07 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Conversation is dull when there is nothing to argue about :) Mar 21, 2007 7:59:15 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i know that in my discussion group everyone else was against it Mar 21, 2007 7:59:16 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but it seems here that everyone is for it Mar 21, 2007 7:59:24 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: interesting Mar 21, 2007 7:59:26 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: I'm not up to speed on general politics, so I don't think I could say anything for sure either way. Mar 21, 2007 7:59:28 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: what do you guys think about loyola's use of facebook/ Mar 21, 2007 7:59:31 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: ? Mar 21, 2007 7:59:32 PM EDT
CMC rocks: what is the status with that? Mar 21, 2007 7:59:58 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I believe any pictures on facebook containing "illegal activities" can incriminate the people in them. (Am I wrong?) Mar 21, 2007 8:00:51 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: I believe that is the case, yes. Or if you are written up for a party and pictures are posted onilne, they can use those as evidence against you. Mar 21, 2007 8:01:28 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but only if you are written up? Mar 21, 2007 8:01:51 PM EDT
CMC rocks: like they won't go searching facebook to incriminate you unless you are already an offender? Mar 21, 2007 8:02:09 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: i'm not sure Mar 21, 2007 8:02:28 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Interesting point Mar 21, 2007 8:02:30 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: I didn't know that. Mar 21, 2007 8:02:48 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: that also brings up an interesting issue though: you can't necessarily PROVE just from a picture that you were drinking underage. for example (and yes i know that this is unlikely) but you could just be holding a cup and not actually drinking it. Mar 21, 2007 8:03:40 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah, well for most pictures Mar 21, 2007 8:03:53 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I was just thinking that! Mar 21, 2007 8:03:56 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Unless there is a sign behind you that says a room number or something... Mar 21, 2007 8:04:08 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but i guess if you're doing a keg stand or something really overt Mar 21, 2007 8:04:11 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yes that's true Mar 21, 2007 8:04:25 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: But that could not be used as evidence against a person for a specific event Mar 21, 2007 8:04:48 PM EDT
CMC rocks: what do you mean by that? Mar 21, 2007 8:05:10 PM EDT
[Roberta Sabin joined the session] Mar 21, 2007 8:05:20 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: We said that pictures can only be used as evidence in a specific case, but there is no way to link a picture to that case, right? Mar 21, 2007 8:05:48 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well, regardless, I think that the use of facebook is an invasion of privacy. Mar 21, 2007 8:06:20 PM EDT
CMC rocks: I don't know about that Mar 21, 2007 8:06:23 PM EDT
CMC rocks: really? because someone said earlier that myspace was public Mar 21, 2007 8:06:37 PM EDT
CMC rocks: and facebook, because it is also on the internet, a public domain, should also be public by that logic Mar 21, 2007 8:06:55 PM EDT
[Roberta Sabin left the session] Mar 21, 2007 8:07:01 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: myspace IS public. Facebook is meant to be a means of communication amongst students from a particular school. Mar 21, 2007 8:07:11 PM EDT
CMC rocks: not anymore Mar 21, 2007 8:07:16 PM EDT
CMC rocks: anyone who has an email address of any kind can get a facebook account Mar 21, 2007 8:07:29 PM EDT
CMC rocks: it was originally intended for college students, but now it's completely open to everyone Mar 21, 2007 8:07:44 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: But a person on facebook can choose to keep it private, no? Mar 21, 2007 8:07:45 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yes Mar 21, 2007 8:07:53 PM EDT
CMC rocks: same as myspace Mar 21, 2007 8:07:58 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Ah, I don't use myspace. Mar 21, 2007 8:08:07 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Even if you're just enrolled for one summer course, I was told that you could make a facebook account from a Loyola email address. Mar 21, 2007 8:08:19 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well me neither, but that's what i've heard Mar 21, 2007 8:08:21 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: I'm not sure though. Mar 21, 2007 8:08:25 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well, if a myspace/facebook is set to be private (amongst a certain group of individuals), I believe it's wrong to use any information from that source. Mar 21, 2007 8:08:44 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well you don't even need a loyola account at all Mar 21, 2007 8:08:47 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so if you set all of your settings on facebook so that only your friends can view your profile, how would the school be able to look at your pictures anyway? unless they access it from one of your friends Mar 21, 2007 8:09:01 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well are phone numbers considered private? what if you're unlisted and the NSA taps into your calls? Mar 21, 2007 8:09:15 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: On the other hand, if you have a public myspace or anything of the sort, I think that is public information. Mar 21, 2007 8:09:17 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i'm sure they could hack in Mar 21, 2007 8:09:25 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but is that right? Mar 21, 2007 8:09:32 PM EDT
CMC rocks: it's probably just as right as it would be for the NSA to track the calls from an unlisted phone nubmer Mar 21, 2007 8:10:03 PM EDT
CMC rocks: which we seemed to think was okay Mar 21, 2007 8:10:09 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well, as I said, we're giving up our rights for a noble cause. Mar 21, 2007 8:10:25 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: The Patriot Act is a bit different than a college using Facebook to catch kids drinking. Mar 21, 2007 8:10:48 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but for the NSA thing, we're trying to prevent terrorism, not underage drinking. i think the caliber of those crimes are completely different Mar 21, 2007 8:11:01 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Exactly. Mar 21, 2007 8:11:09 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: What about the possibility that employers can look at myspace/facebook/other pictures online and allow these pictures to influence whether or not they hire you? Mar 21, 2007 8:11:38 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah that is a very good point Mar 21, 2007 8:11:38 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i think that falls more in the caliber of underage drinking Mar 21, 2007 8:11:54 PM EDT
CMC rocks: not quite as noble a cause as preventing terrorism Mar 21, 2007 8:12:03 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Again, I think it depends if the information is public or not. Mar 21, 2007 8:12:26 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: again i have a quesiton about how they are accessing your facebook profile if your settings are completely private Mar 21, 2007 8:12:35 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Any information considered public, I believe anyone can use against you for any reason. If you are declaring something to the world, why complain when it comes back to bite you? Mar 21, 2007 8:13:27 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Yeah, ignorance wouldn't be a good defence. Mar 21, 2007 8:13:53 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i think we're just not sure whether private myspace and facebook pages are considered public because of the fact that they're on the internet which is public Mar 21, 2007 8:14:17 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well the entire internet is not considered public, really. Mar 21, 2007 8:15:02 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah that's my question...i know that the internet is public, but if you speficially set up your account to be private, is that still public anyway? Mar 21, 2007 8:15:17 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: That I don't know. Mar 21, 2007 8:15:26 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: *specifically Mar 21, 2007 8:15:36 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: No, it shouldn't be public. Mar 21, 2007 8:16:18 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: that's what i think Mar 21, 2007 8:16:25 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Just like when you put in credit card information online or something. It is not public just because it is on the internet. Mar 21, 2007 8:16:44 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah, because you are actively setting it to private Mar 21, 2007 8:16:50 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so then if someone somehow hacks into your supposedly private profile, i DO think that that is an invasion of privacy Mar 21, 2007 8:16:54 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: good point goldeneye Mar 21, 2007 8:17:00 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i agree Mar 21, 2007 8:17:01 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Definitely. Mar 21, 2007 8:17:03 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so then i guess in response to the facebook thing, if you DON't set your facebook to private, and then there are pictures of you publically posted, you run the risk of possibly being incriminated. but if you DO set it to private, then those pictures can't be used against you?? because the info would have been obtained illegally?? Mar 21, 2007 8:18:32 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yes, i think that's how things should be, but i am not sure if that is the policy here at loyola or elsewhere Mar 21, 2007 8:19:03 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I agree Mar 21, 2007 8:19:13 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: *publicly Mar 21, 2007 8:19:30 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: So where do we draw the line between this type of situation and the Patriot Act? Mar 21, 2007 8:19:31 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well the patriot act says for anti-terrorism purposes Mar 21, 2007 8:19:58 PM EDT
CMC rocks: so this would not apply Mar 21, 2007 8:20:03 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: right Mar 21, 2007 8:20:11 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I know, what I mean is that we have found an issue where a certain giving up of rights is permissible on grounds of preventing terrorism. I think, however, in the future the line between the importance of privacy and crime prevention will become obscured. Mar 21, 2007 8:21:40 PM EDT
CMC rocks: so it should be something different than terrorism-related and terrorism-unrelated, but what should that be? Mar 21, 2007 8:22:50 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah like we agree that the facebook and the terrorism situations are on completely different levels, but if we take a situation somewhere in between, when do we cross over from it being not acceptable to being acceptable? Mar 21, 2007 8:23:31 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: That is what is up for debate, I suppose. Mar 21, 2007 8:23:34 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i think for right now, everything in the middle would be considered unacceptable by most people Mar 21, 2007 8:24:59 PM EDT
CMC rocks: it is only becuase of events like 9/11 that we have become okay with anti-terrorism precautions Mar 21, 2007 8:25:16 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Right. Mar 21, 2007 8:25:25 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: If a single life could be saved by an invasion of privacy, is it permissible? Mar 21, 2007 8:26:06 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well, i'd like to think it should be, but until people see loss of lives from not doing something, they're probably unlikely to let privacy invasions take place Mar 21, 2007 8:26:50 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i agree with the fact that it is the events surrounding 9/11 that have made it acceptable Mar 21, 2007 8:28:11 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: and in regards to a single life....i think that a life is worth more than privacy Mar 21, 2007 8:29:27 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but that's my personal opinion Mar 21, 2007 8:29:31 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i feel the same way Mar 21, 2007 8:30:01 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well, obviously I think the answer is yes. It's just interesting to consider how certain situations can simply trivialize our rights. Mar 21, 2007 8:30:09 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but i wonder if enough people do to make that acceptable Mar 21, 2007 8:30:17 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Hey, how about the example of the letter found in the locker that prevented a school shooting? Mar 21, 2007 8:31:36 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Are we specifically discussing online privacy, or privacy in general. Mar 21, 2007 8:32:18 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: Can you tell more details about the scenario, since probably not everybody has heard of it Mar 21, 2007 8:32:22 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Sorry, I got a phone call I had to take Mar 21, 2007 8:32:28 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well i think that's awesome that it prevented a school shooting, but i'm pretty sure that if they had just discovered a love letter or something, people would have been really angry at whoever was searching ehtir lcokers as opposed to happy that at life was saved Mar 21, 2007 8:32:29 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: Privacy in general, but mostly with the internet. Mar 21, 2007 8:32:34 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Ah. Mar 21, 2007 8:33:19 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: just to make things more difficult, i'll bring up this point: while we as college students don't likely have much to hide on the level of terrorism and are thus out privacy rights are not really affected by the patriot act, what do you think of the fact that this sort of an act will target certain groups (like arabs)? Mar 21, 2007 8:34:15 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: The problem is that, if we say something like that is permissible, we throw our privacy rights out the window. (I'm assuming the school had just found that letter, and did not get any tips about a school shooting) Mar 21, 2007 8:34:34 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but did they find the letter by actively searching the locker or was it just lying around? Mar 21, 2007 8:35:11 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: But then again, would that be grounds for new policies, like, routine locker inspections. Mar 21, 2007 8:35:31 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: And would that work, or would it cause more friction among students? Mar 21, 2007 8:36:08 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i know in my high school we had locker inspections Mar 21, 2007 8:36:37 PM EDT
CMC rocks: it wasn't really a controversy though Mar 21, 2007 8:36:49 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: In your opinion, did it help? Mar 21, 2007 8:37:03 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well they did find drugs that way Mar 21, 2007 8:37:31 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Ah. Mar 21, 2007 8:37:38 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but that was the only big incident Mar 21, 2007 8:37:43 PM EDT
CMC rocks: no school shooting was prevented or anything like that Mar 21, 2007 8:37:54 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah we had locker inspections at my school too Mar 21, 2007 8:38:03 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Ah, we never did at my school. Mar 21, 2007 8:38:13 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Unless there is cause to believe something will be found in a locker, I don't think it is ethical to search. Mar 21, 2007 8:38:17 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Sometimes, it would be hard to establish such a cause. Mar 21, 2007 8:39:16 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well it's like any other search Mar 21, 2007 8:39:30 PM EDT
CMC rocks: you need a search warrant, reasonable cause... Mar 21, 2007 8:39:40 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Especially in a high school environment, where kids may be more reluctant to speak up for whatever reason (social, avoiding embarrasment). Mar 21, 2007 8:40:14 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: rocks, do you mean in a school environment? Mar 21, 2007 8:40:28 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Or is it more general? Mar 21, 2007 8:40:40 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well i don't think you actually need a search warrant to search a locker in school, i was just saying that cause could be established in the same way as any other search Mar 21, 2007 8:40:59 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Oh, okay. Yeah, I would agree with that., Mar 21, 2007 8:41:17 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Right. Mar 21, 2007 8:41:30 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: ( I believe that since the lockers are the property of the school that's why they can do searches, if that helps anyone. ) Mar 21, 2007 8:41:45 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Legally, yes. Mar 21, 2007 8:42:10 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: That makes sense. Mar 21, 2007 8:42:12 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Ethically, no! Mar 21, 2007 8:42:13 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: ok yeah thanks nicole....i was wondering what made it ok in that situation Mar 21, 2007 8:42:17 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: To me, anyway. = ) Mar 21, 2007 8:42:24 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but on the other hand, since it IS school property, you should know not to store anything in there that would somehow get you in trouble if the lockers WERE searched Mar 21, 2007 8:43:01 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well, actually, whatever you put in your locker could be considered public then, in that case. Just like the internet discussion we had. Mar 21, 2007 8:43:50 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: and if you do decide to do it anyway, then you should be aware that you are taking that risk Mar 21, 2007 8:43:50 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: right. Mar 21, 2007 8:44:11 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah Mar 21, 2007 8:44:23 PM EDT
CMC rocks: it seems like you have to put things in your locker though Mar 21, 2007 8:45:33 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Forced invasion or privacy? Mar 21, 2007 8:45:46 PM EDT
CMC rocks: because it's the only school property you can use Mar 21, 2007 8:45:46 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: of* Mar 21, 2007 8:45:48 PM EDT
CMC rocks: almost Mar 21, 2007 8:45:54 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i mean if you have drugs with you or something, you don't need to put THAT in your locker, but there are inevitably going to be personal things in your locker Mar 21, 2007 8:46:25 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: That's true. Mar 21, 2007 8:49:10 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yes but those personal things likely won't be incriminating Mar 21, 2007 8:49:35 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Like a letter? = P Mar 21, 2007 8:50:04 PM EDT
CMC rocks: probably not, but i think it is the personal things that people have a hard time giving up their privacy of Mar 21, 2007 8:50:05 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah Mar 21, 2007 8:50:11 PM EDT
CMC rocks: anything Mar 21, 2007 8:50:13 PM EDT
CMC rocks: like for people who don't have terrorist plans and might not want to give up their privacy, it is on the account of the personal things that they want to keep their own Mar 21, 2007 8:50:52 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Perhaps they care more that their rights are being ignored more than the actual personal items found in the locker, though. Mar 21, 2007 8:52:18 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: ok that makes sense Mar 21, 2007 8:52:33 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well, technically, do you have a right to privacy? and how much? i think that's really unclear Mar 21, 2007 8:52:46 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Nicole? Mar 21, 2007 8:53:07 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Haha Mar 21, 2007 8:53:09 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i don't know...that's a good question though Mar 21, 2007 8:53:40 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (wait why am I being asked the question?... i'm not a poli sci major) Mar 21, 2007 8:53:44 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: Alright guys, i'm getting the sense taht you've run out of things to say, haha Mar 21, 2007 8:55:29 PM EDT
