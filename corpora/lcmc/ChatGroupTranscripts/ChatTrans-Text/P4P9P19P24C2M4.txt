Melissa Carbone: is everyone ready to begin? Mar 25, 2007 3:03:38 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yup Mar 25, 2007 3:03:41 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: yes Mar 25, 2007 3:03:44 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yes Mar 25, 2007 3:03:45 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: yes Mar 25, 2007 3:04:17 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: OK your next topic is the legalization of marijuana Mar 25, 2007 3:04:21 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: is anyone opposed to this or for this? Mar 25, 2007 3:05:08 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I'm for it Mar 25, 2007 3:05:26 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: I'm for it Mar 25, 2007 3:05:32 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: well, i believe that there should definitelly be legalization of medicinal marijuana Mar 25, 2007 3:05:32 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I am not necessarily opposed to it Mar 25, 2007 3:05:33 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: they have decided to legalize it in small amounts for personal use in denver Mar 25, 2007 3:05:33 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: what does anyone think about that Mar 25, 2007 3:05:38 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Sure, as long as you can regulate those "small amounts" Mar 25, 2007 3:05:52 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: because there are demonstrated benefits in patients with certain chronic illnesses Mar 25, 2007 3:06:04 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well I'm sure they have some standard and if you're caught with more then the problems arise Mar 25, 2007 3:06:12 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I think if it becomes completley legalized, some of the thrill of using an illegal drug will dissipate Mar 25, 2007 3:06:42 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I am hestitant about the immediate legalization of recreational marijuana because I don't believe there has been enough research into the long-term effects of the drug Mar 25, 2007 3:07:03 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: If you only allow small amounts, that thrill will still be there Mar 25, 2007 3:07:12 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i agree which would either be a good thing, or make people turn to another drug for a bigger thrill Mar 25, 2007 3:07:15 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: so people will want to abuse it more Mar 25, 2007 3:07:21 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: but at the same time, it doesn't take smoking a lot to get high Mar 25, 2007 3:07:55 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: is there a certain age minimum for using it in Denver? Mar 25, 2007 3:07:57 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: But marijuana isnt addictive like cocaine or marijuana Mar 25, 2007 3:07:58 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I do not know that they have really found worse long-term effects than cigarettes, for example Mar 25, 2007 3:08:00 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: 21 Mar 25, 2007 3:08:02 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i believe Mar 25, 2007 3:08:05 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: ah Mar 25, 2007 3:08:16 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: cocaine or heroine i meant to say Mar 25, 2007 3:08:24 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: are there any restrictions against smoking pot and driving? Mar 25, 2007 3:08:35 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah I don't think there are really any long term affects that are any worse than cigarettes of even alcohol for that matter Mar 25, 2007 3:08:39 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well obviously, you can't be under any controlled substance while driving Mar 25, 2007 3:09:00 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: ii'm pretty sure its illegal Mar 25, 2007 3:09:02 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I am as well Mar 25, 2007 3:09:10 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: ah, thanks, just checking Mar 25, 2007 3:09:12 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but as far as the health effects, they do not seem to be any worse than the already legal alcohol or nicotine Mar 25, 2007 3:09:30 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: nicotine is probably worse Mar 25, 2007 3:09:53 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: only because its addictive, i don't think the effects are worse Mar 25, 2007 3:10:12 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: in that case, if it's just as or less harmful than legal substances like cigarettes and alcohol, and the same restrictions are placed on it in terms of legal age of consumption and driving and so forth, I don't see why it shouldn't be made legal Mar 25, 2007 3:10:17 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I think it could provide any extra tax resource for the state, as well as cut down on the black market and thus some crime Mar 25, 2007 3:10:25 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Could not agree more Mar 25, 2007 3:10:42 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I think there's a taboo surrounding marijuana Mar 25, 2007 3:11:01 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: would anyone be allowed to grow it? Mar 25, 2007 3:11:02 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah in fact i think alcohol is even more dangerous than pot Mar 25, 2007 3:11:15 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Just because its a "drug" doesnt mean its a horrible thing Mar 25, 2007 3:11:31 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I work in a hospital pharmacy, and we occassionally have THC in capsule fom Mar 25, 2007 3:11:55 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: do you think that there would be problems with under-age marijuana use, as there are severe problems in this country with under-age drinking? Mar 25, 2007 3:12:03 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: for glaucoma patients and AIDS patients Mar 25, 2007 3:12:09 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Not if its completely legalized Mar 25, 2007 3:12:29 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: maybe at first, but eventually, the novelty will wear off Mar 25, 2007 3:12:46 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well i don't think the problems with marijuana could get any worse regardless of legalization Mar 25, 2007 3:12:47 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what do you mean by completely? Mar 25, 2007 3:12:50 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I believe the problems with underage use will continue Mar 25, 2007 3:13:05 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: If its legal like ibuprofen or robitussin, theres no thrill of using it Mar 25, 2007 3:13:22 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: legal for all ages you mean? Mar 25, 2007 3:13:41 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: In theory, yes Mar 25, 2007 3:13:54 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Look at Amsterdam Mar 25, 2007 3:14:01 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what about Amsterdam? Mar 25, 2007 3:14:14 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Locals there don't walk around stoned all day Mar 25, 2007 3:14:16 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: even though its legal Mar 25, 2007 3:14:26 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: for all ages? Mar 25, 2007 3:14:31 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Regulation can be achieved Mar 25, 2007 3:14:33 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Not sure of the age Mar 25, 2007 3:14:40 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but there is most likely an age restriction like 18+ Mar 25, 2007 3:14:47 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i wonder if drug trafficking would really subside if marijuan were legalized Mar 25, 2007 3:16:36 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: no they'd just move on to other things Mar 25, 2007 3:16:48 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i feel like there are plenty of other drugs Mar 25, 2007 3:16:49 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: it would probably shift to other drugs Mar 25, 2007 3:17:03 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: that marijuana wouldn't make that much of a difference Mar 25, 2007 3:17:03 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I think it would make some difference Mar 25, 2007 3:17:23 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: not an extreme difference, but some nonetheless Mar 25, 2007 3:17:33 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: college and highschool kids do not have to resort to illegal actions, necessarily (depending on the age) to obtain the marijuana Mar 25, 2007 3:17:51 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: is marijuana a gateway drug? Mar 25, 2007 3:18:08 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: no i don't think it it Mar 25, 2007 3:18:58 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: It probably is, but I think that depends more on the person than anything else Mar 25, 2007 3:18:59 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Agreed, people I know how have used it do not use it as such Mar 25, 2007 3:19:16 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i dont consider it to be in the same category as heavier drugs Mar 25, 2007 3:19:28 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: def not Mar 25, 2007 3:19:38 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: it's not addictive, you don't build up a tolerance, it won't kill you Mar 25, 2007 3:19:40 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: at least not immediately Mar 25, 2007 3:19:47 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: There are plenty of legal drugs that are way worse Mar 25, 2007 3:20:25 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: right Mar 25, 2007 3:20:27 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: And the use is definitely less than that of cigarettes when you consider something like lung problems Mar 25, 2007 3:20:38 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well that depends Mar 25, 2007 3:20:58 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: it's true, i was reading an article in the NY Times last week about certain sleeping pills Mar 25, 2007 3:21:20 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: How so Janada Mar 25, 2007 3:21:28 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: there are people that i went to high school with that i could probably count on my fingers how many times i saw them not high in all four years Mar 25, 2007 3:21:28 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i feel like the government doesnt want to legalize it because that would look like a loss in the war on drugs Mar 25, 2007 3:21:29 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: that were found to cause people do drive while asleep Mar 25, 2007 3:21:36 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: which must be at least as bad as driving drunk Mar 25, 2007 3:21:56 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: The mere economics of it though, it would cost like 20 times that of a cigarette Mar 25, 2007 3:21:59 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: I think that driving drunk is worse to be honest Mar 25, 2007 3:22:08 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: the demand is less, it will drive use down Mar 25, 2007 3:22:11 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Definitely worse Mar 25, 2007 3:22:27 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: ...driving that is Mar 25, 2007 3:22:32 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: with alcohol Mar 25, 2007 3:22:36 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: alcohol is pretty much just a worse drug all around Mar 25, 2007 3:23:34 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: not really, if you think about studies that have shown that driving while exhausted causes similar effects as driving while drunk Mar 25, 2007 3:23:42 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: That's not a drug though Mar 25, 2007 3:24:23 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: what's not? Mar 25, 2007 3:24:53 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but a drug causes that effect Mar 25, 2007 3:25:07 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: but marjiuana isn't classified as a depressant is it? Mar 25, 2007 3:26:54 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but this is all really beside the point I was trying to make, which is that there are legal drugs that remain legal even after extremely harmful effects are discovered Mar 25, 2007 3:26:57 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but do they have easy access? Mar 25, 2007 3:27:15 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: you have to go through a pharmacist and are made aware of those affects Mar 25, 2007 3:27:26 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: sleeping pills? yes Mar 25, 2007 3:27:26 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: sleeping pills are not OTC Mar 25, 2007 3:27:45 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i feel like it's much easier to got pot than it is to get sleeping pills though Mar 25, 2007 3:27:49 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: exactly, people should be made aware of marijuana's effects before they use them as well Mar 25, 2007 3:27:53 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Ok, but sleeping pills are not OTC as mtnbike alluded to Mar 25, 2007 3:28:07 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and more research should look into those effects Mar 25, 2007 3:28:09 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I think marijuana has been extensivley studied Mar 25, 2007 3:28:40 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Agreed, for quite some time Mar 25, 2007 3:28:49 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: because if we're comparing marijuana to cigarettes and alcohol like we have been, i don't the amount of research is comparable Mar 25, 2007 3:29:00 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i think you'd be surprised Mar 25, 2007 3:29:22 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: then why did we take an alcohol edu course, but not a marijuana edu course Mar 25, 2007 3:29:30 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Becuase it has not caused as many problems Mar 25, 2007 3:29:42 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: because marijuana isn't legal Mar 25, 2007 3:29:43 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: the school does not have to legally cover themselves Mar 25, 2007 3:29:48 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Haha, precisely Mar 25, 2007 3:29:55 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: neither is alcohol for kids under 21 Mar 25, 2007 3:29:56 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: But it has caused problems Mar 25, 2007 3:30:08 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what do mean that the school does not have to legally cover themselves? Mar 25, 2007 3:30:16 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah but there aren't just students who are uner 21 here Mar 25, 2007 3:30:16 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: a significant enough number for the school to try to cut the risk Mar 25, 2007 3:30:24 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Precisely Mar 25, 2007 3:30:31 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: right, but only the students under 21 have to take the course Mar 25, 2007 3:30:33 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: and college isn't known for its drug use, it's known for its alcohol use Mar 25, 2007 3:30:37 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: um, college is known for marijuana use Mar 25, 2007 3:30:50 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah but you are going to turn 21 eventually aren't you? Mar 25, 2007 3:30:54 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: We also do not take a driving course Mar 25, 2007 3:30:56 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: no more than high school is Mar 25, 2007 3:30:59 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: its just not the issue at hand Mar 25, 2007 3:31:00 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i think you're missing my point, that is, if marijuana were to become legal, I think that schools need to take the same measures they do with alcohol Mar 25, 2007 3:32:13 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: provide as much education as possible about it Mar 25, 2007 3:32:26 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yes, but it's not legal now, this is why there is no course Mar 25, 2007 3:32:28 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: And the school can not educate on EVERYTHING, it should be the responsible of the user Mar 25, 2007 3:32:46 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: there are plenty of people not even interested in trying Mar 25, 2007 3:32:51 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: must they sit through this Mar 25, 2007 3:32:54 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Why rely on other people all the time Mar 25, 2007 3:33:05 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: take some responsibility Mar 25, 2007 3:33:10 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I had to sit through the alcohol edu tihng Mar 25, 2007 3:33:11 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: thing* Mar 25, 2007 3:33:15 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: if you want to use, maybe the school can have the information available Mar 25, 2007 3:33:19 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Again, it is a legal and relevant problem on campus Mar 25, 2007 3:33:39 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: You are missing our point Mar 25, 2007 3:33:43 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i'm sorry, what is a legal and relevent problem? Mar 25, 2007 3:34:13 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: alcohol Mar 25, 2007 3:34:27 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: ah Mar 25, 2007 3:34:32 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: And there may even be an insurance issue behind it Mar 25, 2007 3:34:49 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: can you elaborate on that? Mar 25, 2007 3:35:01 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Where is there is someone insuring the college, it may be much cheaper to have us educated to atleast attempt to mitigate the problem Mar 25, 2007 3:35:12 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Where there* Mar 25, 2007 3:35:23 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: LIke if you take extra driving courses you can cut down on your car insurance Mar 25, 2007 3:35:40 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I'm sorry, I'm still a little confused Mar 25, 2007 3:35:40 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: oh I see Mar 25, 2007 3:35:46 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: But I am only speculating Mar 25, 2007 3:36:01 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: and also alcohol edu is more about educating you on how to drink responsibly, you can't really educate people on smoking illegal drugs responsibly Mar 25, 2007 3:36:40 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Haha, yes, good point Mar 25, 2007 3:36:51 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: this is true Mar 25, 2007 3:37:00 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: Does anyone know, in Denver, what the reaction was to the legalization of marijuana? Mar 25, 2007 3:37:37 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: No clue Mar 25, 2007 3:37:43 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: nope Mar 25, 2007 3:37:47 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I didn't even hear about it until this study Mar 25, 2007 3:37:49 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i'd heard about it, but i haven't heard any reactions Mar 25, 2007 3:38:14 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: Do you think that a legal age of consumption will become a controversial issue, as the legal of consumption for cigarettes and alcohol has been? Mar 25, 2007 3:38:48 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: oh definitely Mar 25, 2007 3:39:37 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: yeah Mar 25, 2007 3:39:41 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Ofcourse, there will always be people to bring up those issues and have a point one way or the other, because how can you really place one single age on all people regardless of gender or body chemistry Mar 25, 2007 3:39:45 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what do you think the age should be? if that is, you think there should be such an age minimum at all Mar 25, 2007 3:40:27 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: if there is an age, its gotta be 18 Mar 25, 2007 3:40:49 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: why 18? Mar 25, 2007 3:41:08 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: thats when you become an adult Mar 25, 2007 3:41:11 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: but drinking is 21 Mar 25, 2007 3:41:47 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: that should be 18 too Mar 25, 2007 3:41:55 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: you can die for your country when youre 18 Mar 25, 2007 3:42:14 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: but i don't think you can have drinking be 21 and not have pot be 21 Mar 25, 2007 3:42:20 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: why not be able to drink? Mar 25, 2007 3:42:27 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i'm not saying that i disagree that the drinking age should be 18 Mar 25, 2007 3:42:44 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: they both should be 18 Mar 25, 2007 3:42:55 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah but i don't think that it's going to change back to 18 Mar 25, 2007 3:43:24 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: not anytime soon Mar 25, 2007 3:43:34 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: so if they legalize marijuana, which i think would happen before the drinking age changed, it will probably be 21 Mar 25, 2007 3:44:04 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i agree Mar 25, 2007 3:44:17 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Agreed Mar 25, 2007 3:44:20 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: it would probably go to 21 in this society Mar 25, 2007 3:44:28 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: If I may just bring up a fact that I think is rather important and relevant, there is no record of any deaths that have been attributed to marijuana use, but it's too hard to count the number of deaths attributed to alcohol use Mar 25, 2007 3:45:47 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: exactly why alcohol is the worse of the two Mar 25, 2007 3:46:13 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: eating can be attributed to way more deaths than alcohol Mar 25, 2007 3:46:34 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: eating how? Mar 25, 2007 3:46:49 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: True enough Mar 25, 2007 3:46:50 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Heart disease Mar 25, 2007 3:46:56 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: obesity Mar 25, 2007 3:46:57 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: okay that's fair Mar 25, 2007 3:47:02 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i do however wonder if legalizing marijuana will really decrease use of illegal drugs Mar 25, 2007 3:49:03 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: if the reason for smoking pot is the thrill Mar 25, 2007 3:49:15 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: no probably not Mar 25, 2007 3:49:15 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Those drugs are a separate issue Mar 25, 2007 3:49:25 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: than people will most likely just start with another illegal drug Mar 25, 2007 3:49:31 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: perhaps one more dangerous Mar 25, 2007 3:49:39 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I do not think it is a thrill for as many people as we would think Mar 25, 2007 3:49:43 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I think people smoke it because it provides pleasure and no immediate danger Mar 25, 2007 3:50:03 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I think the difference is that marijuana is not really harmful to you Mar 25, 2007 3:50:09 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: really i know a lot of people that smoke pot that would never do a worse drug Mar 25, 2007 3:50:14 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: exactly Mar 25, 2007 3:50:23 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: And it would be far cheaper than others Mar 25, 2007 3:50:29 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Right Mar 25, 2007 3:50:44 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well, not cheaper than like crack Mar 25, 2007 3:51:25 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: but that'll just kill you anways Mar 25, 2007 3:51:35 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but it may cause some harm, the Drug Policy Allliance states that studies on marijuana's mental effects demonstrate that the drug may reduce or impari short-term memory, loewr concetration, and alter sense of time, swift reactions and coordination Mar 25, 2007 3:51:36 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: impair* Mar 25, 2007 3:51:49 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: lower* Mar 25, 2007 3:51:53 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Marijuana is cheaper Janada Mar 25, 2007 3:52:03 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: crack is like five dollars Mar 25, 2007 3:52:13 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Interesting Mar 25, 2007 3:52:36 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: just that the effects only last like five minutes Mar 25, 2007 3:52:44 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I'm not saying this to argue against legalization Mar 25, 2007 3:52:54 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I'm saying this to argue with the statement that the drug doesn't cause any harm Mar 25, 2007 3:53:13 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well in response to what you said klutzo, it doesn't sound any worse than alcohol Mar 25, 2007 3:53:15 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: that is why i support the legalizaiton of marijuana Mar 25, 2007 3:53:30 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: because the effects are no worse than alcohol Mar 25, 2007 3:53:39 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I just wanted to make it clear that there are certain harmful effets Mar 25, 2007 3:53:50 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: effects* Mar 25, 2007 3:53:54 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Sure Mar 25, 2007 3:54:02 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i never thought that there weren't any Mar 25, 2007 3:54:47 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i Mar 25, 2007 3:54:58 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i'm sorry, i wasn't responding to you Janada, i was responding to mtnbike Mar 25, 2007 3:55:12 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: well sure Mar 25, 2007 3:55:44 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: oh okay Mar 25, 2007 3:56:09 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: So then, do we all pretty much agree for legalization, or atleast see no strong reason against it? Mar 25, 2007 3:58:34 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah pretty much Mar 25, 2007 3:58:48 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: there are worse drugs out there that are legal, etc Mar 25, 2007 3:59:03 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Yeah, and I feel like the government feels the same way but doesnt want to give in Mar 25, 2007 3:59:04 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yes... though I believe that along with legalization an increase in available information and education should occur Mar 25, 2007 3:59:05 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yes, availability, but not forced Mar 25, 2007 3:59:22 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well i think that's inevtible Mar 25, 2007 3:59:32 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i am more concerned with the details of implementation Mar 25, 2007 3:59:34 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: for example, what is a small amount? Mar 25, 2007 3:59:40 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Right, there are some issues regarding how you would even regulate how much one person has Mar 25, 2007 3:59:52 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I think that is pretty impossible Mar 25, 2007 3:59:55 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: because you can just go to other stores Mar 25, 2007 4:00:00 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: or get someone else to purchase for you Mar 25, 2007 4:00:05 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Who would be the suppliers if it does become legal? Mar 25, 2007 4:00:17 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I just think it really matters if you were to get caught at a party or you were busted, if you had more than you were supposed to, that's when problems would ensure Mar 25, 2007 4:00:23 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: ensue Mar 25, 2007 4:00:25 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: right, and will there still be crime with people who try to sell or obtain more than is allowed Mar 25, 2007 4:00:36 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well it would probably be something like going to the liqueor store Mar 25, 2007 4:00:39 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I think your local convenience store Mar 25, 2007 4:00:46 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: But who would grow it? Mar 25, 2007 4:00:51 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: perhaps bars would pop up like oxygen bars only for marijuana Mar 25, 2007 4:00:57 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: thus making people smoke within their facilities Mar 25, 2007 4:01:05 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: or like hookah bars Mar 25, 2007 4:01:16 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I these are all questions that the govenrment should consider Mar 25, 2007 4:01:39 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i think these* Mar 25, 2007 4:01:49 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: and i'm sure they will Mar 25, 2007 4:02:55 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: it's definitley not someting that will happen over night Mar 25, 2007 4:03:11 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: and we haven't heard of denver having any problems thus far Mar 25, 2007 4:03:22 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: No, nothing in the news, like I said, I did not even know about this until the study Mar 25, 2007 4:03:41 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: OK guys I think we can wrap it up here Mar 25, 2007 4:04:26 PM EDT
