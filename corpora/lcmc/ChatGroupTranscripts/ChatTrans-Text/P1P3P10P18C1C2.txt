CMC troy2112: that being gay is a choice Mar 18, 2007 7:24:18 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: haha ahh right well that is the whole rejection of science aspect of the church Mar 18, 2007 7:24:34 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: and by praying you can become straight Mar 18, 2007 7:24:36 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: its biological Mar 18, 2007 7:24:38 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: yea Mar 18, 2007 7:24:45 PM EDT

CMC bjbsh23: for a little while Mar 18, 2007 7:30:01 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: then it would be the same way it' always been Mar 18, 2007 7:30:12 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: unless men think "girls can be priests? f**k it then"" Mar 18, 2007 7:30:21 PM EDT

CMC troy2112: why would it be the same way? Mar 18, 2007 7:30:53 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i honestly don't believe it would change much Mar 18, 2007 7:31:46 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea i sadly agree, the church has larger issues in my opinion Mar 18, 2007 7:32:08 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i guess Mar 18, 2007 7:32:23 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: i dont know if there would be a ton of people knocking down the door to be priests but it opens it up to more people Mar 18, 2007 7:32:26 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: yea Mar 18, 2007 7:32:33 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: yeah Mar 18, 2007 7:32:37 PM EDT

CMC troy2112: mhm Mar 18, 2007 7:33:31 PM EDT

CMC bjbsh23: i personally would never participate directly or have an abortion, however i don't think it's my right to not let others not have them Mar 18, 2007 7:35:23 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: agreed. i think that if abortion was illegal everywhere girls would still find a way Mar 18, 2007 7:35:57 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: exactly Mar 18, 2007 7:36:01 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: better in a sterile environment then a coat hanger in an alley Mar 18, 2007 7:36:15 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: i think abortion transcends religion in many ways, obviously catholics hold a special strong stance against it but it is also dependent on socio economic status as well Mar 18, 2007 7:36:24 PM EDT
[CMC hoopdreams13 left the session] Mar 18, 2007 7:37:00 PM EDT

CMC xyz456: so basically have sex and hope for the best is what they are thinking? Mar 18, 2007 7:44:01 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: they are a form of keeping pregnancies from happening Mar 18, 2007 7:44:10 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well then youre only sinning once as opposed to (number of times you plan on having sex in the future) Mar 18, 2007 7:44:10 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: exactly Mar 18, 2007 7:44:13 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: were there condoms or some form of them back in biblical times? Mar 18, 2007 7:45:06 PM EDT
