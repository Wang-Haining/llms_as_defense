Nicole Becker: okayy next topic is the war in iraq May 1, 2007 10:11:40 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: The Senate has been debating setting a deadline for our pull out. Also the president says he's sending 2400-3000 additional troops (that on top of the 27000 authorized). May 1, 2007 10:12:05 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: thoughts? May 1, 2007 10:12:49 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: i think a deadline needs to be established now May 1, 2007 10:13:15 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: that is absurd to send that many additional troops when we have already had far too many troops die and most of the country doesn't suport this war May 1, 2007 10:13:18 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: ASAP May 1, 2007 10:13:25 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i agree May 1, 2007 10:13:28 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: agreed May 1, 2007 10:13:33 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i know nicole, i plan on writing another May 1, 2007 10:13:49 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: we can do that right? May 1, 2007 10:13:54 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: yeah May 1, 2007 10:14:12 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: the next president is going to have to make a really difficult decision May 1, 2007 10:15:18 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: which is sad because it is bush's mess May 1, 2007 10:15:30 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: it's ver ytrue May 1, 2007 10:15:58 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: how did you guys feel at the beginning of the war vs now? May 1, 2007 10:17:44 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well May 1, 2007 10:17:59 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i think bush was very sneaky May 1, 2007 10:18:16 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: and played off the tail end of the 9/11 buzz to get support May 1, 2007 10:18:32 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i never bought that story May 1, 2007 10:18:49 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well don't you think thats what he did? May 1, 2007 10:19:00 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: in the begining i was uneasy about war in general May 1, 2007 10:19:01 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: i see war as a last resort May 1, 2007 10:19:06 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: war on terror! kill terrorism! May 1, 2007 10:19:08 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i really always was against the war May 1, 2007 10:19:15 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: o my goodness he played the errorism up May 1, 2007 10:19:27 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: yea but why do you think we went? May 1, 2007 10:19:30 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: yea May 1, 2007 10:19:33 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: oil, pressure May 1, 2007 10:19:47 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yeah i was confused as to why May 1, 2007 10:19:48 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: me too but i am very liberal.. i think ties to the bush sr. were very much in play with us being in iraq noq May 1, 2007 10:19:53 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: a maltitude of reasons May 1, 2007 10:19:57 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: unfinished bush family business May 1, 2007 10:20:02 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: eh May 1, 2007 10:20:19 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: none of the reason were valid May 1, 2007 10:20:22 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: definately May 1, 2007 10:20:28 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well i don't believe it was gas May 1, 2007 10:20:30 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: /oil May 1, 2007 10:20:33 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i think that was somewhat involved May 1, 2007 10:20:44 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: because the prices are still exorbitant May 1, 2007 10:20:44 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: how can you say that? May 1, 2007 10:20:51 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: and i guess it wasnt WMD's casue there were none May 1, 2007 10:20:57 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: haha May 1, 2007 10:21:03 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: look how much our gas prices have changed since 9/11 May 1, 2007 10:21:08 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: that was the reason they gave, at least May 1, 2007 10:21:10 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: why? May 1, 2007 10:21:11 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: it was an excuse to raise them May 1, 2007 10:21:18 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: down the crapper? May 1, 2007 10:21:22 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: how the hell would we invade a country thats almost a complete oil mine and our gas prices rise? May 1, 2007 10:21:48 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: im not being sarcastic May 1, 2007 10:21:53 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yeah May 1, 2007 10:22:00 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i don't know anything about economics May 1, 2007 10:22:01 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: it just seems illogical May 1, 2007 10:22:11 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: its just confusing in general May 1, 2007 10:22:12 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: like why are we still there? May 1, 2007 10:22:16 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: me neither all i know is gas is like 3.00 a gallon and its not even the summer yet May 1, 2007 10:22:17 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well, thats why i threw out that reason May 1, 2007 10:22:30 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i mena i'm mnot so sure May 1, 2007 10:22:44 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: but fair enough May 1, 2007 10:22:48 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well, even intelligent people who want us to stay there (like mccain) believe the war is being carried out in the completely wrong way May 1, 2007 10:23:34 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: training troops is poorly done, etc May 1, 2007 10:23:46 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: right May 1, 2007 10:23:54 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: but at this point it may be too late to turn around May 1, 2007 10:23:55 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: thats my main question May 1, 2007 10:24:03 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: is it too late? or would us being there after a revised system was put in place be better than if we were never there at all? May 1, 2007 10:24:36 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: honestly i think it needs to be brought to an end for the troops and many people's wlfare, but we're leaving the country to be more of a long term threat to us if we just up and leave May 1, 2007 10:24:53 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: we helped make the mess... is there even a chance we can clean something up? May 1, 2007 10:24:56 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yeah i tihnk we need to help clean up May 1, 2007 10:25:03 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: see at this point how long would a revised system take to implement time is important now May 1, 2007 10:25:11 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: a deadline is not really the right answer May 1, 2007 10:25:15 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: that would be like vietnam May 1, 2007 10:25:26 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: help clean up? we removed a murderous dictator from power for them May 1, 2007 10:25:27 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yes i agree. i dont think we an just up and leave May 1, 2007 10:25:28 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: clean up was the wrong way to put that. May 1, 2007 10:25:49 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i mean we've done a lot to help May 1, 2007 10:25:55 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: and we can't up and leave May 1, 2007 10:26:04 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: yea, but is it stable enough? May 1, 2007 10:26:08 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yes i agree, but i dont tihnk they could be on their won May 1, 2007 10:26:09 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: own May 1, 2007 10:26:25 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: but i'm just sick of feeling liek we're over there on an extending babysitting job May 1, 2007 10:26:32 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: also, here's another point: May 1, 2007 10:26:35 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yeah May 1, 2007 10:26:37 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: (a selfish one) May 1, 2007 10:26:49 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yae but they can not stand with out us now May 1, 2007 10:26:53 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: who the hell cares about a country half a world away? May 1, 2007 10:26:58 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: the dependancy is too deep May 1, 2007 10:26:59 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: save our boys May 1, 2007 10:27:01 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: we have to think about the future of our country too May 1, 2007 10:27:22 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: just throwing it out there May 1, 2007 10:27:38 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yeah i agree there are other conflicts that we need to focus on too May 1, 2007 10:27:45 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: and bush and his intelligence leaders shouldve thought of that when we started May 1, 2007 10:27:58 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea i agree bring the troops home May 1, 2007 10:28:09 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: we have soldiers over there who have no ideawhat they are even fighting for May 1, 2007 10:28:31 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: would u fight like it meant sumthing if it didnt? May 1, 2007 10:28:45 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: thats a COMPLETELY different issue. May 1, 2007 10:28:45 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i sure as hell wouldnt May 1, 2007 10:28:49 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: no May 1, 2007 10:28:50 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i wouldn't have enlisted. May 1, 2007 10:28:58 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: well maybe thats why things are goign so poorly May 1, 2007 10:29:06 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: or reenlisted, if theyre still there. May 1, 2007 10:29:08 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: well its not even that they dotn know what they wanted to fight for, but even wew ere just discussing how we dont know what we are doing over there May 1, 2007 10:29:26 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: you enlist to be a part of a cause that meanssomething more valuable to your country May 1, 2007 10:29:27 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: also, the overwhelming majority of soldiers DO believe in doing their job, if not believe in what theyre doing as well May 1, 2007 10:29:56 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: exactly May 1, 2007 10:30:10 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: soldiers that are over there are for the cause May 1, 2007 10:30:10 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: not all the time May 1, 2007 10:30:17 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: whatever the cause is they cant question what they are doing while they are in iraq they would becomie a liablility May 1, 2007 10:30:41 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yeah May 1, 2007 10:30:54 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: the armed forces can't read any minds May 1, 2007 10:31:04 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i dont know, i dont think any of us can talk unless we are over there/are close to someone over ther May 1, 2007 10:31:31 PM EDT

CMC bjbsh23: he said the things i just mentioned May 1, 2007 10:32:36 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: all im saying is that i think we have lost focus and if many people in america are not sure what we are fighting for isnt it possible that some of the armed forces are not sure as well May 1, 2007 10:32:47 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: he felt he was fighitng for sumthing that had changed, not against terroism and he felt left in the dark May 1, 2007 10:32:57 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well screw me then May 1, 2007 10:33:01 PM EDT

CMC hoopdreams13: ahh yes agreed May 1, 2007 10:38:40 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: and at the same time making sure that iraqi forces are able to rule their own people May 1, 2007 10:39:01 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: there government and military must be prepared before we completely leave otherwise chaos will insue May 1, 2007 10:39:35 PM EDT

Nicole Becker: what should we do concerning the government over there? (in your opinion) May 1, 2007 10:43:41 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: its tough ... democracies are just not realistic in some instances and i think Iraq is that type of situation May 1, 2007 10:44:19 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: agreed May 1, 2007 10:44:52 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: yeah its definately not for them May 1, 2007 10:45:48 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i would just say that it's time for them to find some normal structure, whatever that may be May 1, 2007 10:47:45 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: and get out May 1, 2007 10:47:48 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea agreed May 1, 2007 10:47:58 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: so did we reach the word quota May 1, 2007 10:48:55 PM EDT

CMC troy2112: well wasn't the focus rebuilding without hussein? May 1, 2007 10:52:42 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea deffinately its almost as though after hussein there was no game plan May 1, 2007 10:52:44 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yes but we like planned to make them a democracy. i feel like its an unrealistic gorl May 1, 2007 10:53:54 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: goal May 1, 2007 10:53:55 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: yeah May 1, 2007 10:54:09 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: i completely agree May 1, 2007 10:54:17 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: things have just gone downhill severely May 1, 2007 10:54:51 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yeah i feel like they need to focus on getting the country running without hussein, not rudhing them into a democracy May 1, 2007 10:57:16 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea just make it work however May 1, 2007 10:58:15 PM EDT

[CMC hoopdreams13 left the session] May 1, 2007 11:01:18 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: it shouldn't, it's really hard to tell with chat how much length there is, so we'll just have to take what we get May 1, 2007 11:01:20 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: ok thanks!
