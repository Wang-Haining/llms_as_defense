Nicole Becker: the second topic is gender discrimination.... let me type up the little story quick Apr 15, 2007 7:04:06 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: In Maryland, several IT executives are being investigated for creating a minority-owned business that was just a front. The executives' wives were listed as the heads of the business so that they could more easily procure government contracts targeted at minority and women-owned businesses. But there were no employees- all the work was to be done by the firms headed by the male executives Apr 15, 2007 7:05:45 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: thats wild' Apr 15, 2007 7:06:29 PM EDT

CMC troy2112: i.e., women aren't viewed as having 'smaller brains' or anything that ridiculous Apr 15, 2007 7:21:06 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: right Apr 15, 2007 7:22:03 PM EDT

CMC hoopdreams13: i think that is the only step Apr 15, 2007 7:38:06 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i mean, there already are discrimination laws Apr 15, 2007 7:38:09 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: that will be recognized Apr 15, 2007 7:38:14 PM EDT

CMC bjbsh23: as of now, there are still older generations who vocalize and teach their children that women have a place in this world that isn't in a job Apr 15, 2007 7:45:10 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: but i don't think equality is so far off Apr 15, 2007 7:45:35 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: the state of affairs will always approach equality, but never be equal to it Apr 15, 2007 7:46:28 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: like limits in calculus Apr 15, 2007 7:46:50 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: i mean in 50 more years it could be equal Apr 15, 2007 7:46:54 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: is that too long Apr 15, 2007 7:46:56 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: who knows Apr 15, 2007 7:46:59 PM EDT

CMC troy2112: actually, i dont know if this is too off-topic, but the only swear word that actually offends people is the 4 letter "c" word Apr 15, 2007 7:53:09 PM EDT
