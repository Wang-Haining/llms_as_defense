Nicole Becker: your next topic is the gay church. Let me get your discussion starter quick Mar 28, 2007 7:56:46 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: The pope this week issued an apostolic exhortation reaffirming that priests should be celibate men. He also reminded all that divorced and remarried Catholics should not receive Communion. Mar 28, 2007 7:56:58 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: the... gay.. church? Mar 28, 2007 7:57:20 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: the gay church?? Mar 28, 2007 7:57:20 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: SORRY Mar 28, 2007 7:57:28 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: catholic church... Mar 28, 2007 7:57:31 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: lol Mar 28, 2007 7:57:33 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: i was reading what i named the recording session and it was gay/church so yeah.. :( sorry haha Mar 28, 2007 7:57:43 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Can we get a clarification on the story? Mar 28, 2007 7:58:17 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yes please Mar 28, 2007 7:58:31 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Divorced means just divorced or couples who receive an anulment? (whatever the word is for the church allowing someone to marry again) Mar 28, 2007 7:59:10 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: lol Mar 28, 2007 7:59:13 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: Basically, how do you feel about the fact that a) the pope is basically saying he won't even consider changing to let priests marry-- they must be completely celibate, and b)) how do you feel that divorced or remarried couples can never receive communion again after that? Mar 28, 2007 7:59:26 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: because that makes a huge difference in teh church's eyes Mar 28, 2007 7:59:35 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: annulment is different from divorce Mar 28, 2007 7:59:38 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: this is just divorced Mar 28, 2007 7:59:46 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Oh Mar 28, 2007 7:59:50 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: well in response to a.) i definitely think that priests should be allowed to marry Mar 28, 2007 8:00:17 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Okay, well I agree that divorce is way too wide spread these days. Marriage is getting trivialized and basically means nothing. Mar 28, 2007 8:00:20 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Personally, I would like to know the reasons against priests getting married. Mar 28, 2007 8:00:27 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: I understand that they have a commitment to their parish, but what other reasons are there/ Mar 28, 2007 8:00:40 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: ?* Mar 28, 2007 8:00:43 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: The reason is that they are supposed to devote their lives completely and utterly to God. Mar 28, 2007 8:00:45 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i think the logic is you are married ot god Mar 28, 2007 8:00:49 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: (And not to someone of the opposite sex) Mar 28, 2007 8:00:54 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yes and also that jesus wasn't married so neither should priests be Mar 28, 2007 8:01:04 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: (and not to get off topic but with all of teh da vinci code and similar stuff coming out, that is questionable) Mar 28, 2007 8:01:40 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but i think those are the only reasons Mar 28, 2007 8:01:50 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: The Da Vinci Code is hardly a reputable source, though. Mar 28, 2007 8:02:09 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah i know that i'm just saying that it has sparked a lot of research etc. Mar 28, 2007 8:02:36 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Hasn't the Church proven its falsity? Mar 28, 2007 8:02:39 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: ah Mar 28, 2007 8:02:47 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: ok forget i brought that up Mar 28, 2007 8:02:55 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: No no no, I'm not sure. Mar 28, 2007 8:03:03 PM EDT
CMC rocks: lets talk about the celibacy issue Mar 28, 2007 8:03:12 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but i think that jesus and complete devotion are teh reasons for celibacy Mar 28, 2007 8:03:20 PM EDT
CMC rocks: do you think it is effective in strenthening their relationship with god? Mar 28, 2007 8:03:27 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I just figured since they made it into a Tom Hanks movie, it must not be too reputable. lol Mar 28, 2007 8:03:32 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Then again, the Church is facing a decline of men entering the seminary. Mar 28, 2007 8:03:55 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: and personally i think that the priests could better connect/relate with a larger percentage of the parish if he was married Mar 28, 2007 8:04:05 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Do you think it might become necessary for them to allow priests to marry under these circumstances Mar 28, 2007 8:04:21 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: and yes crash, that would help to bring the numbers back up Mar 28, 2007 8:04:21 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Couldn't the act of love also strengthen their ties to God? If you are a priest, you believe that God granted you that sacred act. Mar 28, 2007 8:04:47 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well just having marraige an option would deter less people from priesthood Mar 28, 2007 8:05:14 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Right, but do you think that the Church would get to a point where it became necessary to allow marriage among the religious. Mar 28, 2007 8:05:16 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i feel that it's getting to that point now Mar 28, 2007 8:05:37 PM EDT
CMC rocks: so for practical reasons, i think they might have to Mar 28, 2007 8:05:40 PM EDT
CMC rocks: the catholic church seems so strict that i wonder if they would ever really do that Mar 28, 2007 8:06:05 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: the church has evolved over the centuries to adapt (example, vatican II) so i don't see what the big deal is Mar 28, 2007 8:06:11 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: It could also depend on the successive popes. Mar 28, 2007 8:06:29 PM EDT
CMC rocks: it's always a struggle at first to make a chage, but then people accept it Mar 28, 2007 8:06:34 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: well the current pope benedict is ultra conservative, so i don't see it happening under him Mar 28, 2007 8:06:38 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well, the only way to have an institution last for so long on a global scale is to keep it constant. Mar 28, 2007 8:06:38 PM EDT
CMC rocks: *change Mar 28, 2007 8:06:41 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: well, consistency is good Mar 28, 2007 8:06:56 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: but some church practices simply get outdated Mar 28, 2007 8:07:05 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but then how would you account for the changes up to now? Mar 28, 2007 8:07:06 PM EDT
CMC rocks: it hasnt been perfectly consistent up to this point Mar 28, 2007 8:07:23 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: what are you referring to, specifically? Vatican II? Mar 28, 2007 8:07:35 PM EDT
CMC rocks: in fact, i think modernizing the church is the best way to keep it going Mar 28, 2007 8:07:36 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i agree that consistency is good, but the times have changes so drastically from the hundreds and hundreds of years that teh church has been in existence so some change is necessary to maintain followers Mar 28, 2007 8:07:52 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i agree rocks Mar 28, 2007 8:08:05 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: The Church is a fixed entity in that it serves the purpose of guiding people in their faith lives. Mar 28, 2007 8:08:09 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: How it does that is subject to change. Mar 28, 2007 8:08:16 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: At least, that's how I would understand it. Mar 28, 2007 8:08:41 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yes, it needs to be able to service its members Mar 28, 2007 8:08:44 PM EDT
CMC rocks: which involves flexibility Mar 28, 2007 8:08:59 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: and in response to the celibacy of priests, that is a completely manmade law. way back when, they used to be able to marry, and then some people got together and decided against it Mar 28, 2007 8:09:07 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Right, but you have to be careful what you change. In Vatican II, they made changes to the mass ceremony that made it much more available to people attending. But changing celibacy and allowing female priests would change foundations that have been there for thousands of years. Mar 28, 2007 8:09:32 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i really don't see what the big deal is in allowing priests to marry - other denominations do it Mar 28, 2007 8:09:43 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: exactly Mar 28, 2007 8:09:51 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Well, back then, the reasons given were that a priest might bequeath church land and wealth to his family upon his death Mar 28, 2007 8:09:54 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah and that doesn't really apply anymore Mar 28, 2007 8:10:12 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: And again, that a priest is meant to serve God wholeheartedly. Mar 28, 2007 8:10:14 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well you could make a rule against that Mar 28, 2007 8:10:17 PM EDT
CMC rocks: it doesnt have to be against marraige Mar 28, 2007 8:10:24 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: priests of other denominations seem to be perfectly able to devote themselves to their families AND to their church Mar 28, 2007 8:11:01 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: In the Catholic Church, aren't deacons allowed to get married? Mar 28, 2007 8:11:06 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so i don't see why catholic priests would be so inept in doing that Mar 28, 2007 8:11:13 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yes, but there are certain regulations Mar 28, 2007 8:11:22 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah, thats a good point Mar 28, 2007 8:11:23 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: you can't be a deacon and THEN get married Mar 28, 2007 8:11:32 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Ah, ok. Mar 28, 2007 8:11:37 PM EDT
CMC rocks: ok Mar 28, 2007 8:11:37 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Okay, that just seems silly. Mar 28, 2007 8:11:42 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: if you are married first, you can become a deacon though Mar 28, 2007 8:11:42 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Do you know the reason for that? Mar 28, 2007 8:11:58 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: no, sorry...i just know that my uncle wanted to become a deacon, but he was planning on getting married soon Mar 28, 2007 8:12:21 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so he had to wait to become a deacon otherwise he wouldn't be able to get married Mar 28, 2007 8:12:41 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: and he hasn't become a deacon yet...i don't think he's going to anymore Mar 28, 2007 8:13:04 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so if deacon's can be married, why can't priests??? Mar 28, 2007 8:13:22 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Greater responsibility? Mar 28, 2007 8:13:39 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i guess so Mar 28, 2007 8:13:52 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: More devotion is required for a priest. Mar 28, 2007 8:13:58 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: What do deacons do anyway? Mar 28, 2007 8:14:02 PM EDT
CMC rocks: what would happen if an already married person wanted to be a priest? could they get divorced or would that make it impossible too? Mar 28, 2007 8:14:10 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i like to think of a deacon as a part-time priest Mar 28, 2007 8:14:31 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Good question. Mar 28, 2007 8:14:31 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I suppose they would have to get an anulment. Mar 28, 2007 8:14:35 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i'm not sure if that's theologically correct Mar 28, 2007 8:14:42 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: That means they were never really married in the Church's eyes. Mar 28, 2007 8:14:46 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: pretty much everything a priest can do during mass except for consecration Mar 28, 2007 8:15:10 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but i'm not positive Mar 28, 2007 8:15:14 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (just to throw this out there: i believe celibate is that they have NEVER had sex in their lives) Mar 28, 2007 8:15:26 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: that's virginity, not celibacy, right? Mar 28, 2007 8:15:52 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: exactly crash Mar 28, 2007 8:16:03 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Yep. Mar 28, 2007 8:16:06 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: celibacy is abstaining from sex Mar 28, 2007 8:16:06 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: i thought they had to be celibate their whole lives but i could be wrong Mar 28, 2007 8:16:07 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: chastity is living appropriately Mar 28, 2007 8:16:15 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Married couples are supposed to be chaste, but are still allowed to have sex Mar 28, 2007 8:16:35 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Hope that makes sense. Mar 28, 2007 8:17:09 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i'm not sure about divorce/annulment, but i know that if you are a widower, you CAN become a priest Mar 28, 2007 8:17:18 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so you don't have to have never had sex Mar 28, 2007 8:17:26 PM EDT
CMC rocks: that makes more sense Mar 28, 2007 8:17:36 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: that's kind of asking a lot to require that all men entering the priesthood be virgins Mar 28, 2007 8:18:11 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Otherwise, the people eligible for priesthood would be really slim. Mar 28, 2007 8:18:14 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: or they would be lying Mar 28, 2007 8:18:21 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah Mar 28, 2007 8:18:26 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: So what about allowing priestesses? Mar 28, 2007 8:18:53 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah but i would HOPE that someone who wanted to be a priest would not lie in order to take their vows Mar 28, 2007 8:18:59 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Again, going back to the shortage of men in the seminary, it's possible that it might become necessary to allow women into the priesthood. Mar 28, 2007 8:19:28 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Personally, I'm for it. Mar 28, 2007 8:19:45 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: What if there was no shortage? Mar 28, 2007 8:19:48 PM EDT
CMC rocks: me too Mar 28, 2007 8:19:53 PM EDT
CMC rocks: still Mar 28, 2007 8:19:54 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i don't know Mar 28, 2007 8:20:00 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: So what about not allowing divorced couples to receive communion? Mar 28, 2007 8:21:17 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i am against that Mar 28, 2007 8:21:29 PM EDT
CMC rocks: me too Mar 28, 2007 8:21:36 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Marriage is the most sacred of bonds, though. Mar 28, 2007 8:21:50 PM EDT
CMC rocks: they're still catholics though right? Mar 28, 2007 8:22:02 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah and it is an EXTREMELY difficult process to obtain an annulment Mar 28, 2007 8:22:28 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Do you know what the process is? Mar 28, 2007 8:22:51 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yes you have to get all of these letter of witness from people who knew you during the marriage and they have to write about specific reasons why the marriage was not real in the first place Mar 28, 2007 8:23:40 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: and those people have to be catholic i believe and they have to get their priests to sign the letters Mar 28, 2007 8:24:12 PM EDT
CMC rocks: that seems kind of silly Mar 28, 2007 8:24:18 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I suppose it depends on how difficult the process of annulment is. Ideally, an annulment would take care of all those marriages in which it was not the fault of those getting married. In that case, I am fine with not allowing divorced people to receive communion. Marriage should be a LIFE decision. Mar 28, 2007 8:24:38 PM EDT
CMC rocks: do you think a marraige can be "not real" anyway? i mean it existed Mar 28, 2007 8:24:41 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: and then the whole application has to be signed by a ton of different people in teh church hierarchy Mar 28, 2007 8:24:49 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: all the way up to the vatican Mar 28, 2007 8:24:54 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: it's a ridiculous process and it takes FOREVER Mar 28, 2007 8:25:04 PM EDT
CMC rocks: wow! Mar 28, 2007 8:25:06 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so a lot of people choose not to go through it and just get a legal divorce Mar 28, 2007 8:25:22 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so i don't think that they should be denied communiion Mar 28, 2007 8:25:38 PM EDT
CMC rocks: that seems understandable given the process Mar 28, 2007 8:25:49 PM EDT
CMC rocks: and i'm sure it would take a very long time, during which you would still be married Mar 28, 2007 8:26:06 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Yeah, that seems reasonable to me. Kind of a dissapointing conclusion, though. Mar 28, 2007 8:26:22 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah basically an annulment says that the marriage never existed int he first place...that for some reason or another one person entered into teh marriage under false pretenses i believe Mar 28, 2007 8:26:45 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Such as if one person did not want to have children and one did. Mar 28, 2007 8:27:20 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: (I've heard that, somewhere) Mar 28, 2007 8:27:35 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yes....if there was dishonesty right from the start, like the people wanted two different things Mar 28, 2007 8:28:25 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Right. Mar 28, 2007 8:28:41 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so where were we going with this, not that we have a background of what an annulment is? Mar 28, 2007 8:29:25 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: *now Mar 28, 2007 8:29:47 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Since the annulment process is out of control, legally divorced couples should be allowed to receive Communion anyways. Mar 28, 2007 8:30:17 PM EDT
CMC rocks: ithink it was communion Mar 28, 2007 8:30:22 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: (I believe that is our conclusion) Mar 28, 2007 8:30:27 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i completely agree goldeneye Mar 28, 2007 8:30:31 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yes, i would agree also Mar 28, 2007 8:30:34 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Hey hey hey, maybe some kind of process to allow them back into the Church community? Mar 28, 2007 8:30:57 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: There's still about ahalf hour left... nobody has any other points to bring up as to where else the church needs reformation or anything? Mar 28, 2007 8:31:00 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: A Penance? Mar 28, 2007 8:31:00 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: on a similar note, i read an article about how politicians who are pro-choice are also not supposed to recieve communion Mar 28, 2007 8:31:02 PM EDT
CMC rocks: they could extend that to any opinion they disagree with Mar 28, 2007 8:31:30 PM EDT
CMC rocks: like anyone who supports gay marriage can't receive either Mar 28, 2007 8:31:42 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i don't think the church should force you to conform to their beliefs in order to participate Mar 28, 2007 8:31:58 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i mean, no one is going to agree with the church on every single point Mar 28, 2007 8:32:20 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Interesting point. Mar 28, 2007 8:32:30 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: I didn't know that/ Mar 28, 2007 8:32:54 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Hmm... well I do not agree with abortion. I think it is different then the gay marriage question., Mar 28, 2007 8:33:11 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i agree, but to play the other side, how do you decide at which point this becomes too much? like when you disagree with too many points, are you no longer a catholic?? Mar 28, 2007 8:33:11 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah, i think if you start with this, things can get out of control quite easily Mar 28, 2007 8:34:39 PM EDT
CMC rocks: so i don't support starting with something like this Mar 28, 2007 8:34:52 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: what do you suggest? Mar 28, 2007 8:35:02 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i just don't think you should exclude someone from communion based on their opinions Mar 28, 2007 8:35:26 PM EDT
CMC rocks: you can still be a Catholic and have a different opinion than the church Mar 28, 2007 8:35:44 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: right Mar 28, 2007 8:35:51 PM EDT
CMC rocks: otherwise, there would hardly be any, because most people have their disagreements in some way with the Catholic church Mar 28, 2007 8:36:03 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: clockwatcher, you made a good point. To be a Catholic means to share the views of the Church, no? Mar 28, 2007 8:36:15 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Otherwise, what does it mean Mar 28, 2007 8:36:21 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: ? Mar 28, 2007 8:36:22 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yes but i have heard some catholic say "catholicism is not like a chinese menu, you can't pick and choose what to believe and what not to believe" Mar 28, 2007 8:36:45 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Exactly Mar 28, 2007 8:37:14 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but is it realistic to expect Catholics to believe in every single doctrine of the church? it may be ideal, but i don't think it actually works like that Mar 28, 2007 8:37:19 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: right and i think that from the official church position, as a catholic you are supposed to spread the ideas of teh catholic church, not just choose somethings to believe and disregard others Mar 28, 2007 8:37:40 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well if you believe in the church then you believe that it is directly connected to Jesus Christ. Mar 28, 2007 8:37:56 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Therefore, shouldn't you agree with everything they declare to be Church doctrine? Mar 28, 2007 8:38:12 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: not i don't think that is it realistic, but from the official Church view, i wonder what they say? Mar 28, 2007 8:38:20 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yes, i think you are supposed to goldeneye Mar 28, 2007 8:38:33 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well the church doctrines are created by people Mar 28, 2007 8:38:56 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: the way i personally rationalize it (me being a catholic but NOT believeing in everything) is that many of the doctrines that i disagree with were created by man, not by God Mar 28, 2007 8:39:13 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: exactly Mar 28, 2007 8:39:15 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Makes sense. Mar 28, 2007 8:39:23 PM EDT
CMC rocks: so who's to say they couldn't be wrong? it's not directly connected to Jesus Mar 28, 2007 8:39:26 PM EDT
CMC rocks: that was exactly my point, clockwatcher Mar 28, 2007 8:39:43 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Then, to me, it is pointless to be a Catholic. Mar 28, 2007 8:40:13 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i'm just asking whether OFFICIALLY....are you a catholic if you don't believe everything?? Mar 28, 2007 8:40:17 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I don't think so. Mar 28, 2007 8:40:35 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: that wouldn't make sense to me Mar 28, 2007 8:40:39 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: say, what if you're not sure Mar 28, 2007 8:40:54 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but catholics have different views about the consecration and teh divinity of christ, etc Mar 28, 2007 8:41:04 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i think by that strict a definition, a lot of people who call themselves Catholics would not be Mar 28, 2007 8:41:13 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: that are not connected to these manmade laws Mar 28, 2007 8:41:13 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: right rocks, i don't think it's fair though to ask people not to think for themselves and to just blindly believe everything becasue that's what their church believes Mar 28, 2007 8:42:00 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Agreed. Mar 28, 2007 8:42:15 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: goldeneye?? Mar 28, 2007 8:42:22 PM EDT
CMC rocks: it seems like a bit of a paradox, just thinking about our Loyola education Mar 28, 2007 8:42:25 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: can you elaborate rocks? Mar 28, 2007 8:42:37 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Yes, clock, but the Church has an official stance on everything. In the real world, it makes sense that most people would disagree with some aspect of the Church. But where do we draw the line between picking and choosing values? What makes you Catholic then? Mar 28, 2007 8:42:40 PM EDT
CMC rocks: we are learning to think critically, so we shouldn't be expected to blindly follow the church Mar 28, 2007 8:42:46 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: agreed rocks Mar 28, 2007 8:42:56 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: goldeneye, i don't know...that's a very tough call. but personally i would like to think that i still have a religion even though i don't blindly follow everything i'm told. Mar 28, 2007 8:43:51 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: It's not that you SHOULD follow blindly, its just a interesting question whether you are truly a Catholic if you don't. Mar 28, 2007 8:43:52 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i think so Mar 28, 2007 8:44:10 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i would like to think so too......even just for the fact that if not, then where does that leave me? Mar 28, 2007 8:44:38 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: To me, being Catholic is being a good person and embracing the core values of the Church (i.e. Ten Commandments). I really don't think Good will shut out the gates of Heaven to a good person who got divorced. Mar 28, 2007 8:45:13 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: God* Mar 28, 2007 8:45:20 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: as i was trying to say before...i DON"T pick and choose on the aspects of teh divinity of christ or more of the faith aspect...but i do disagree with some of the lifestyle "rules" Mar 28, 2007 8:45:40 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Right, that makes sense. Mar 28, 2007 8:46:00 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i think that still makes you an acceptable Catholic Mar 28, 2007 8:46:11 PM EDT
CMC rocks: you're not perfect in the Church's eyes, but who is? Mar 28, 2007 8:46:23 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: In that respect, I like to think I'm a "modified" Catholic. Mar 28, 2007 8:46:29 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: lol Crash Mar 28, 2007 8:46:35 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: well me too then lol Mar 28, 2007 8:46:47 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: lol, well, I don't agree with everything that's out there because it seems like, at least some of it, is subject to change Mar 28, 2007 8:47:07 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: The problem is that an infallible institution is run by fallible individuals. But hey, we can't have it any other way. Mar 28, 2007 8:47:11 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i would consider you a critical, thoughful catholic who has to believe in something for themselves Mar 28, 2007 8:47:12 PM EDT
CMC rocks: what do you mean "infallible institution", goldeneye? Mar 28, 2007 8:47:39 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Is it that, ideally, the Church should be free from error? Mar 28, 2007 8:48:00 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: The Catholic Church is an institution that should not have any errors. Mar 28, 2007 8:48:17 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: At all. Mar 28, 2007 8:48:22 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: "Should" Mar 28, 2007 8:48:32 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: but in reality, that's not always the case Mar 28, 2007 8:48:41 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah, that's a lot to ask of anyone or thing Mar 28, 2007 8:48:43 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I know, I'm saying thats the problem. Mar 28, 2007 8:48:50 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Right. Mar 28, 2007 8:48:55 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well i guess the same would apply for anything Mar 28, 2007 8:48:56 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: It can NEVER be infallible. Mar 28, 2007 8:48:57 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: But it's supposed to be... Mar 28, 2007 8:49:26 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Another one of these unsolvable problems. Mar 28, 2007 8:49:45 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: humans by our very nature are subject to making mistakes.....so an infallible instituation in the hands of anyone other than GOd is bound to be fallible Mar 28, 2007 8:50:00 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: which i believe was exactly what you said goldeneye Mar 28, 2007 8:50:09 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so yes, i agree that is the precise problem Mar 28, 2007 8:50:16 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so then taking that into account, do you still think that you have to believe EVERYTHING to call yourself a catholic, given the fallibility of the institution? Mar 28, 2007 8:50:50 PM EDT
CMC rocks: this is not unique to the Catholic church, though Mar 28, 2007 8:50:52 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: No, I think it's more of a personal call than anything else. Mar 28, 2007 8:51:16 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I still think you do. Heres my reasoning: Mar 28, 2007 8:51:21 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Okay. Mar 28, 2007 8:51:34 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: In high school, I was taught that everyone is NOT entited to their own opinion on ANY subject. For instance, I would not make a claim about a gay gene to a geneticist or something. Mar 28, 2007 8:52:04 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Therefore, aren't the Church (Vatican, Pope, Cardinals, etc.) the most qualified to form interpreted opinions about Church doctrine? Mar 28, 2007 8:52:45 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well i would disagree right from that starting point, but continue Mar 28, 2007 8:52:49 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i'm with rocks on this one Mar 28, 2007 8:53:00 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: But then, where would you get your beliefs from, if not other human beings? Plus, I'm not sure what makes them more qualified than you to live your life (not you, specifically, but a more general "you") Mar 28, 2007 8:53:27 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i understand what you are saying goldeneye about not knowing much about a specific technical subject, but i'm with crash about knowing about your OWN life Mar 28, 2007 8:54:47 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well, in being a Catholic, you are basing your life decisions on what God would want, right? Mar 28, 2007 8:55:17 PM EDT
CMC rocks: on controversial subjects, there is plenty of room for opinion Mar 28, 2007 8:55:28 PM EDT
CMC rocks: how would you know that for sure? Mar 28, 2007 8:55:40 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: You wouldn't. But the people who are in the best position to interpret God's will all live in the Vatican. Mar 28, 2007 8:56:13 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: moral decisions apply to other religions other than just catholicism Mar 28, 2007 8:56:30 PM EDT
CMC rocks: it seems like you are just saying to follow the experts Mar 28, 2007 8:56:32 PM EDT
CMC rocks: is that a good assessment of what you're getting at, goldeneye? Mar 28, 2007 8:56:50 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Thats seems okay Mar 28, 2007 8:57:19 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so where is there room for personal choice in this goldeneye? Mar 28, 2007 8:57:55 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well, then, how would you account for experts being wrong? because that has happened, and it's been discovered because of people who did not follow blindly, but had their own opinions Mar 28, 2007 8:58:02 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Both very good questions. lol Mar 28, 2007 8:58:40 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i just kind of think that that's a short cut --- an excuse for not having to think for yourself Mar 28, 2007 8:59:08 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: Alright Mar 28, 2007 9:00:56 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: I think on that note we'll end, unless there are any last thoughts remaining? Mar 28, 2007 9:01:06 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: To answer those questions. Mar 28, 2007 9:01:40 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: I'm good. Mar 28, 2007 9:01:50 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: There is definitely plenty of room for opinions in many issues today. Mar 28, 2007 9:02:05 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: And with experts being wrong, it definitely occurs, but they are still the logical choice to trust. Mar 28, 2007 9:02:23 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: Anybody else Mar 28, 2007 9:02:51 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: ? Mar 28, 2007 9:02:52 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: will you send us a reminder email before next time nicole?? Mar 28,
