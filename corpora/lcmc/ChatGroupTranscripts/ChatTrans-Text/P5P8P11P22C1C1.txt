CMC blue322: what made you change Mar 18, 2007 12:13:12 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i felt that the catholic church was way to restricting on both the individual and the group\ Mar 18, 2007 12:13:29 PM EDT
CMC blue322: how were you restricted? Mar 18, 2007 12:13:43 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: haha what a good facilitator Mar 18, 2007 12:13:54 PM EDT
CMC blue322: im just curious..bc i dont feel restricted Mar 18, 2007 12:14:07 PM EDT
CMC blue322: but thank you! Mar 18, 2007 12:14:12 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: the bible tells you not to do all of these things, i guess it wasnt really the catholic church in general but more or less just the idea of an organize religion Mar 18, 2007 12:14:39 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: would you ever consider becoming a homosexual or eating meat on fridays during lent? Mar 18, 2007 12:14:45 PM EDT

CMC blue322: yeas Mar 18, 2007 12:15:19 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: i go to the churc when i can..sometimes i feel like the catholic church makes everything too public Mar 18, 2007 12:15:38 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: personal question you dont have to answer but just think about: do you abide by the no premarital sex rule Mar 18, 2007 12:15:46 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: How so? Mar 18, 2007 12:15:51 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: i think your relationship with god is between you and god Mar 18, 2007 12:15:51 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i havent been to church since 7th grade or so Mar 18, 2007 12:15:55 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: because all four things which i identified are restrictions of sorts Mar 18, 2007 12:15:59 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: fresca... can you explain what you mean about the church making things too public/ Mar 18, 2007 12:16:24 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: sure Mar 18, 2007 12:16:29 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: i mean i hate that you are supposed to go to confession..if you are sorry, can;t you just tell god yourself? Mar 18, 2007 12:16:51 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (reactions, anyone?) Mar 18, 2007 12:17:35 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but god cant directly order you to do the rosary for repentance Mar 18, 2007 12:17:41 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: like a priest can Mar 18, 2007 12:17:46 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: if you are sorry and you decide to change, why isnt that enough? Mar 18, 2007 12:18:01 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i doubt most people ever really change because of what theyve done Mar 18, 2007 12:18:22 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: you really believe that? Mar 18, 2007 12:18:32 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: like if you used the lords name in vain, i doubt most people dedicate their lives to changing that one fact Mar 18, 2007 12:18:57 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: we go to a school which is a "catholic" environment, and i see more people crapping on their faith than following it Mar 18, 2007 12:19:20 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: i dont mean dedicating your life to that..but who would go to confession just to confess that? Mar 18, 2007 12:19:24 PM EDT
CMC blue322: they dont need to dedicate their lives to it Mar 18, 2007 12:19:26 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: to follow shoops point about dedicating Mar 18, 2007 12:19:31 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: excactly what GOBIGDONNY said Mar 18, 2007 12:20:04 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: today the catholic church does a lot of good things social service wise Mar 18, 2007 12:20:19 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: i agree Mar 18, 2007 12:20:25 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: they set up aid programs and what not, and are big proponents of social justice Mar 18, 2007 12:20:31 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: blue322, you said you think the church is just fine, how do you feel about all the pedophilia accusations and other publicized "wrong doings" of the catholic church? Mar 18, 2007 12:20:47 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: they raise charity money that the government would not Mar 18, 2007 12:20:53 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but also, for 150+ years people justified slavery on BIBLICAL terms Mar 18, 2007 12:20:54 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: e.g. divine providence and black people being the descendants of cain Mar 18, 2007 12:21:05 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i think the pediophilia accusations are awful Mar 18, 2007 12:22:12 PM EDT
CMC blue322: but they can happen anywhere Mar 18, 2007 12:22:18 PM EDT
CMC blue322: and with anyone Mar 18, 2007 12:22:22 PM EDT
CMC blue322: and i dont know what other "wrong doings" you mean Mar 18, 2007 12:22:37 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: maybe they are unfortunate outlets for the frustration which necessarily follows from celibacy Mar 18, 2007 12:22:44 PM EDT
CMC blue322: or i havent heard of any recently Mar 18, 2007 12:22:50 PM EDT
CMC blue322: so what about married guys Mar 18, 2007 12:23:00 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: in all honesty now, im not a part of the catholic church, but i feel that it doesnt need to change if it doesnt seek the need to. it's a religion, not some soccer club. though it would be nice to see some changes especially related to the little-boy thing it really is entirely up to them. Mar 18, 2007 12:23:08 PM EDT
CMC blue322: theyre not celibate and they still engage in these acts Mar 18, 2007 12:23:12 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: don't you think priests should be able to marry? Mar 18, 2007 12:23:14 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: they feel sexual frustration as well Mar 18, 2007 12:23:16 PM EDT
CMC blue322: so marriage doesnt save them Mar 18, 2007 12:23:26 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: well Mar 18, 2007 12:23:32 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: if a married man can feel enough sexual frustration to touch kids, then an unmarried/celibate man sure as heck will too Mar 18, 2007 12:23:36 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: if they have somewhere else to divert their sexual frustrations it would help Mar 18, 2007 12:23:41 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: they counsel couples who are engaged or already married, but how can they relate if they don't have that experience themselves? Mar 18, 2007 12:23:43 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its the same reason why you hear so many jokes about jail Mar 18, 2007 12:24:28 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: for instance "dont drop the soap" Mar 18, 2007 12:24:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: because when your locked in there your sexual frustrations develope Mar 18, 2007 12:24:43 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and you end up finding other means to satisfy that Mar 18, 2007 12:24:49 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: in the priests case, little boys Mar 18, 2007 12:24:56 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: in a way true Mar 18, 2007 12:25:16 PM EDT
CMC blue322: your making it sound like all priests touch little boys Mar 18, 2007 12:25:19 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: seriously Mar 18, 2007 12:25:22 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: no matter how high up on the tier you may be in your religion, you still experience human nature Mar 18, 2007 12:25:24 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: am i? Mar 18, 2007 12:25:27 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i didnt realize that Mar 18, 2007 12:25:29 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i never meant that at all Mar 18, 2007 12:25:35 PM EDT
CMC blue322: its ok Mar 18, 2007 12:25:36 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: hmmm Mar 18, 2007 12:25:47 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: im talking about human nature Mar 18, 2007 12:25:53 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but sure your right, there are only a couple bad eggs in the pack Mar 18, 2007 12:26:02 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: well Mar 18, 2007 12:26:02 PM EDT
CMC blue322: and it canbe controlled Mar 18, 2007 12:26:03 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: another part of human nature is to wonder about questions that don't have easy answers Mar 18, 2007 12:26:16 PM EDT
CMC blue322: can you not control your urges? Mar 18, 2007 12:26:20 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: like where the world came from Mar 18, 2007 12:26:23 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and what the point of all this is Mar 18, 2007 12:26:29 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i masturbate 5 times a day Mar 18, 2007 12:26:32 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and religion provides those answers Mar 18, 2007 12:26:33 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: HAHA Mar 18, 2007 12:26:36 PM EDT
CMC blue322: very mature Mar 18, 2007 12:26:50 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: im just kidding Mar 18, 2007 12:27:02 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but there are people who do and thats my point Mar 18, 2007 12:27:09 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: some people feel they CANT control those urges, and that's when it gets out of hand Mar 18, 2007 12:27:26 PM EDT
CMC blue322: ok you win, priests are bad Mar 18, 2007 12:27:29 PM EDT
CMC blue322: they give into urges Mar 18, 2007 12:27:34 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: im not talking about all priests Mar 18, 2007 12:27:38 PM EDT
CMC blue322: whats the next opic to discuss Mar 18, 2007 12:27:42 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i dont see why you arent picking up on that Mar 18, 2007 12:27:43 PM EDT
CMC blue322: topic* Mar 18, 2007 12:27:46 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: wasn't this supposed to be a discussion about the church? not priests sexuality? Mar 18, 2007 12:28:05 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: thats part of the question Mar 18, 2007 12:28:13 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: hey wait though Mar 18, 2007 12:28:16 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: we should understand that: Mar 18, 2007 12:28:27 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: not all priests are bad Mar 18, 2007 12:28:30 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: yes, but that is one aspect of the catholic church, that priests must remain celibate Mar 18, 2007 12:28:34 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and CHRISTIANS should similarly understand that: Mar 18, 2007 12:28:36 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: not all muslims are bad Mar 18, 2007 12:28:39 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: just because a small section does something doesnt mean its representative of a larger behavioral trend Mar 18, 2007 12:28:57 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: i really have nothing to contribute to this conversation Mar 18, 2007 12:29:12 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i understand that, thats what i was trying to say but the other 2 in this room keep accusing me of saying "all priests are boy lovers" Mar 18, 2007 12:29:30 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: which im not saying at all Mar 18, 2007 12:29:43 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: you are an intolerant scmuck Mar 18, 2007 12:29:44 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: okay... let's wrap it up Mar 18, 2007 12:29:47 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: wait just kidding Mar 18, 2007 12:29:50 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: hah Mar 18, 2007 12:30:01 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: aha Mar 18, 2007 12:30:04 PM EDT
CMC blue322: this has been the most intense convo out of all the others Mar 18, 2007 12:30:15 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: ill agree Mar 18, 2007 12:30:22 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: the man is listening Mar 18, 2007 12:30:26 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: heheheheh Mar 18, 2007 12:30:32 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: ive never got such a sense of hostility Mar 18, 2007 12:30:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: the man :) Mar 18, 2007 12:30:38 PM EDT
CMC blue322: sorry Mar 18, 2007 12:30:41 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: okay so lets look at other aspects of the catholic church Mar 18, 2007 12:30:49 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: instead of focusing on just the whole priest celibacy thing Mar 18, 2007 12:31:11 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i feel like its easier to be a jerk when your chatting and not in front of people Mar 18, 2007 12:31:16 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: do you think women should be able to be priests? Mar 18, 2007 12:31:17 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: well lots of other religions do it Mar 18, 2007 12:31:30 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i mean, the catholic church is fine, it's just not my cup of tea. i think it would help if priests could marry it would help with the pedo thing Mar 18, 2007 12:31:31 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i wouldnt mind if women could become priests Mar 18, 2007 12:31:41 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: it might actually bring more people back to the church Mar 18, 2007 12:31:59 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: blue: good call Mar 18, 2007 12:32:01 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but then again Mar 18, 2007 12:32:06 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: why would you want to bring people back just for one stipulation Mar 18, 2007 12:32:14 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: there would be more of a chance they could relate to at least someone or something Mar 18, 2007 12:32:17 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: thats like offering them money to practice your religion Mar 18, 2007 12:32:23 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: sure it gets them there, but for the wrong reason Mar 18, 2007 12:32:33 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i disagree Mar 18, 2007 12:32:39 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i wouldnt go to church for a woman Mar 18, 2007 12:32:43 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: no its understanding the needs of people today and adjusting to that Mar 18, 2007 12:32:45 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: women in the priesthood would be an inclusive move not a bribing mood Mar 18, 2007 12:32:53 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: i agree Mar 18, 2007 12:33:02 PM EDT
CMC blue322: what do you mean Mar 18, 2007 12:33:06 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: it woulkdnt be like Mar 18, 2007 12:33:10 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: thats what i think it should be, rather than just used to get people back to the church Mar 18, 2007 12:33:15 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: "lets make women priests to BRIBE more females to come in the door" Mar 18, 2007 12:33:22 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: it wouldnt be something that would just bring people back..but it would make the church a more accepting place Mar 18, 2007 12:33:36 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: thats all i mean Mar 18, 2007 12:33:42 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: its more like "maybe women will feel less traditionally excluded if we let women be priests" Mar 18, 2007 12:33:44 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: exqactly Mar 18, 2007 12:33:50 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: hey many people find wonderful things in their lives through catholocism Mar 18, 2007 12:34:09 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but some people also take it way too far Mar 18, 2007 12:34:14 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: okay i understand now Mar 18, 2007 12:34:15 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: if women are allowed to be priests, should they be allowed to go further up, like becoming a cardinal or bishop or etc? Mar 18, 2007 12:34:22 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i get it Mar 18, 2007 12:34:24 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: sure why not? Mar 18, 2007 12:34:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: it would be cool to have a female pope Mar 18, 2007 12:34:36 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: absolutely not that would be a travesty in the eyes of god and they would all go to HELL Mar 18, 2007 12:34:41 PM EDT
CMC blue322: thats never going to happen though Mar 18, 2007 12:34:41 PM EDT
CMC blue322: thats too radical of a change Mar 18, 2007 12:34:46 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: hahahaha Mar 18, 2007 12:34:49 PM EDT
CMC blue322: the church seems set in its ways Mar 18, 2007 12:34:53 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: it has been for hundreds of years Mar 18, 2007 12:35:07 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: it is every bit as set it its ways as youd expect a room full of old italian men to be Mar 18, 2007 12:35:09 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: feeling that you are a servant of god-that's what priests are right?-isnt limited to being male Mar 18, 2007 12:35:11 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: true true Mar 18, 2007 12:35:20 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: i think it needs to change Mar 18, 2007 12:35:21 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: well thats where nuns come in Mar 18, 2007 12:35:23 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: im not saying it will, but it needs to Mar 18, 2007 12:35:26 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but being a nun seems like such a less powerful role in the church Mar 18, 2007 12:35:42 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: it is Mar 18, 2007 12:35:46 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: then that isnt fair Mar 18, 2007 12:36:02 PM EDT
CMC blue322: arent all members of the church servantts of God? Mar 18, 2007 12:36:04 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: nuns are cool though Mar 18, 2007 12:36:06 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: ideally they all are Mar 18, 2007 12:36:18 PM EDT
