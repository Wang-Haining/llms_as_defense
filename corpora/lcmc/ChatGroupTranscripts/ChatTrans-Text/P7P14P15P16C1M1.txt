CMC sun_beauty: i think i want a news update so i have something to go off of Mar 27, 2007 7:09:15 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: me too Mar 27, 2007 7:09:22 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: yeah Mar 27, 2007 7:09:34 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: Twelve states allow the medicinal sale of marijuana. Oversight is lax and there are few specific guidelines for buyers and sellers of a drug still illegal under federal law. In CA some owners are making big bucks. The DEA is cracking down and is raiding some clinics. Mar 27, 2007 7:09:42 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (sorry it takes a while to type it lol) Mar 27, 2007 7:09:47 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: is that it or is there more? Mar 27, 2007 7:10:25 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: thats ok Mar 27, 2007 7:10:40 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: that's it... any thoughts on it? Mar 27, 2007 7:10:40 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: is the DEA raiding clinics that arent legal? Mar 27, 2007 7:11:10 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yaeh i was just about to ask that Mar 27, 2007 7:11:22 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: I believe so Mar 27, 2007 7:11:27 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: yeah im a little confused with the wording of the whole statement, actually Mar 27, 2007 7:11:34 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: me too. Mar 27, 2007 7:11:41 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: it isn't very clear, but that's all I was given.. Mar 27, 2007 7:11:45 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: yeah me too Mar 27, 2007 7:11:46 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: ok, well then Mar 27, 2007 7:11:52 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: ok lets see Mar 27, 2007 7:11:58 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: I think the DEA might be raiding the clincs where the owners in CA are making lots of money off of it? Mar 27, 2007 7:12:06 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: i don't understand why marijuana was illegalized in the first place Mar 27, 2007 7:12:46 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i think i will respond by saying that.....i think the idea of marijania...humm sorry i am a horrid spealler, so forgive from here on out.....is a very contriversal drug no mater what angel it is looked at Mar 27, 2007 7:13:17 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: yea especially if its helping people who have cancer ryte>? Mar 27, 2007 7:13:19 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: it is a bit wierd to be giving a drug that is illegal to someone who is sick in the first place Mar 27, 2007 7:13:54 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: theres no reason it should be any more controversial than alcohol Mar 27, 2007 7:13:57 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: alcohol is ten times worse for you, and more dangerous to society Mar 27, 2007 7:14:22 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: same with cigarettes Mar 27, 2007 7:14:29 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah, but alcohol is not illegal, i feel that one of the main reasons that it is controversal is b/c it is illegal Mar 27, 2007 7:14:39 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i am not saying it should stay illegal Mar 27, 2007 7:14:45 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: so what would go wrong if they made it legal? Mar 27, 2007 7:15:08 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: actually, in recent light of the past few weeks, i dont think it should Mar 27, 2007 7:15:13 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: be illegal Mar 27, 2007 7:15:20 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: b/c so far it seems less dangerous than alcohol Mar 27, 2007 7:15:44 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: can you explain what happened in the past few weeks spacestare? Mar 27, 2007 7:15:49 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: b/c as far as i know you cant over dose on it Mar 27, 2007 7:16:02 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: no one has ever died from smoking marijuana Mar 27, 2007 7:16:14 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: thats a fact Mar 27, 2007 7:16:17 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: not one person Mar 27, 2007 7:16:24 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i feel that drug policy in america is skewed and that even if it continues to remain criminalized, the least the government can do is practice a policy of non-enforcement Mar 27, 2007 7:16:31 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: that is tru u dont hear about pplo overdsing on weed its more or so the big drugs like coke Mar 27, 2007 7:16:33 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: what do u mean by non-enforcement Mar 27, 2007 7:17:03 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well, i just hadn't really ever givin the matter much thought b/c it has never affected me, but then i started to find out more about it through doing this study thing Mar 27, 2007 7:17:03 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: plus if it were legal and we could buy it in stores, like alcohol, that would reduce the amount of drug-related crime Mar 27, 2007 7:17:22 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: like have a law and even if someone breaks it dont do anything about it? Mar 27, 2007 7:17:27 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: and no, you can't physically overdose on pot, it would take smoking 21 blunts within an hour to reach ld50 Mar 27, 2007 7:17:40 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: whats Id50? Mar 27, 2007 7:18:00 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: the lethal dosage of any drug Mar 27, 2007 7:18:25 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: oh okl Mar 27, 2007 7:18:32 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i actually feel that they should make it legal b/c then it could be regulated by the US govt Mar 27, 2007 7:18:35 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and also we could actually make money off of it Mar 27, 2007 7:18:44 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: ohh good point Mar 27, 2007 7:18:45 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: yeah, so people dont go killing each other over bad drug deals Mar 27, 2007 7:18:59 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: then we wouldnt have as much problems and could focus on pressing stuff such as the war in iraq Mar 27, 2007 7:19:09 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: do you think it would stop drug related crimes then? Mar 27, 2007 7:19:31 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: or as many drug related crimes?> Mar 27, 2007 7:19:42 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: it probably wouldnt stop them Mar 27, 2007 7:19:49 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: well theres other drugs to be sold Mar 27, 2007 7:19:57 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: not all related crimes Mar 27, 2007 7:20:00 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: ueah Mar 27, 2007 7:20:01 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah* Mar 27, 2007 7:20:03 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: but it would minimize them Mar 27, 2007 7:20:04 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: tru Mar 27, 2007 7:20:11 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and cut down on the drug lords in south america Mar 27, 2007 7:20:23 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: but the war on drugs is perhaps more harmful itself then without it Mar 27, 2007 7:20:30 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: so it would probably help a little bit Mar 27, 2007 7:20:41 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: if we could grow it on american farms, it would also end up creating more jobs and more income for farmers Mar 27, 2007 7:21:04 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: and more workers Mar 27, 2007 7:21:15 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah, seriously....like more people end up dying from geting the drugs accros borders and hold down thier "turf" in the cities and such Mar 27, 2007 7:21:15 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: so less people on the streets Mar 27, 2007 7:21:33 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yaeh very true Mar 27, 2007 7:21:33 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well, at least for selling that particular drug Mar 27, 2007 7:21:49 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: if drug trade was regulated we could also probably work on getting south american countries out of the deep poverty state theyre currently in Mar 27, 2007 7:21:53 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i am sure they would find something else to sell probably Mar 27, 2007 7:22:04 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: yea tru Mar 27, 2007 7:22:12 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: oh, good thought Mar 27, 2007 7:22:22 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: south american countries depend on us to export their goods Mar 27, 2007 7:22:30 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: it doesnt matter if there illegal or not Mar 27, 2007 7:22:41 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah Mar 27, 2007 7:22:52 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: the US would never do anything to help south america Mar 27, 2007 7:23:15 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: lol Mar 27, 2007 7:23:19 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: lol Mar 27, 2007 7:23:21 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: i dont think they would benefit at all Mar 27, 2007 7:23:21 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: that is tru Mar 27, 2007 7:23:30 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: thats how they would see it Mar 27, 2007 7:23:32 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: its not like they have tons of oil or something Mar 27, 2007 7:23:47 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: becuz if u think about america only gets involved when it would benefit us in some way Mar 27, 2007 7:23:50 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: lol Mar 27, 2007 7:23:55 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: well lets say that, hypothetically speaking, we had an administration that cared... Mar 27, 2007 7:24:10 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: ok... Mar 27, 2007 7:24:25 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: correction....we would never do anything to help cuba,...but we prob would do something to help costa rica...they are considered the switzerland of the south....coure they dont relaly need much help Mar 27, 2007 7:24:37 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well, we might actually do something to help colombia Mar 27, 2007 7:24:56 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: b/c they border our county Mar 27, 2007 7:25:03 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: we are yet to have one administration that actually cares about the people in other countries Mar 27, 2007 7:25:04 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and by helping them it would actually help us Mar 27, 2007 7:25:15 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: so in the end...it all comes down to us i guess, lol Mar 27, 2007 7:25:28 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: lol exactly Mar 27, 2007 7:25:33 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: iyea pretty much Mar 27, 2007 7:25:36 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: thats pretty sad Mar 27, 2007 7:25:41 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i was just about to ask why do we always have to benfit in some way Mar 27, 2007 7:25:56 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: because its economic Mar 27, 2007 7:26:10 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: and were isolationist Mar 27, 2007 7:26:17 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: tru Mar 27, 2007 7:26:24 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: we dont do things unless it benefits us Mar 27, 2007 7:26:35 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: we're not that isolationist Mar 27, 2007 7:26:36 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: we are in a war right now Mar 27, 2007 7:26:42 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah i was going to say Mar 27, 2007 7:26:56 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: so how do you guys feel about the differences between recreational marijuana and medicinal marijuana? (trying to get back on topic...) Mar 27, 2007 7:27:01 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: we have not been isolatoinists since we entered WW I Mar 27, 2007 7:27:11 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: not really true, but lets move on Mar 27, 2007 7:27:26 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: lol Mar 27, 2007 7:27:47 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: haha ok we will save that argument for later Mar 27, 2007 7:27:50 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: lol Mar 27, 2007 7:27:54 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: yea Mar 27, 2007 7:28:03 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i dont think the difference between recreational use and medical use matters Mar 27, 2007 7:28:07 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i feel that both of them are okay Mar 27, 2007 7:28:16 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah, b/c it it is all regulated by the govt, then it is all the same pretty much Mar 27, 2007 7:28:30 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: yea weed is weed Mar 27, 2007 7:28:33 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: like we said before they dont harm people except for the fact of the brain with prolonged use Mar 27, 2007 7:28:41 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: thats not even proven though Mar 27, 2007 7:28:54 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: sorry im learning about drugs and their affect on the brain inpsych Mar 27, 2007 7:28:57 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: in psych* Mar 27, 2007 7:29:04 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: ummm...i have to agree with sun_beauty Mar 27, 2007 7:29:13 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: with prolonged use, they do affect people Mar 27, 2007 7:29:24 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: its not yet proven to have longterm affects Mar 27, 2007 7:29:44 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: just like alcohol affects the liver and cigeretts the brain Mar 27, 2007 7:29:46 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: "drugs" is a large group Mar 27, 2007 7:29:52 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: its completely different than cigarettes and alcohol Mar 27, 2007 7:30:15 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well,...not enough people have proven it so that it is universally accepted Mar 27, 2007 7:30:24 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i dont kno if i agree with that Mar 27, 2007 7:30:30 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: that is tru but i9t doesnt mean that its not there Mar 27, 2007 7:30:48 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: it* Mar 27, 2007 7:30:52 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah, it is not compleatly different from alcohol and cigeretts Mar 27, 2007 7:31:13 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: how so? Mar 27, 2007 7:31:19 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: recent studies have been coming out saying that are highly critical of the original studies on marijuana, didnt consider ofher factors, and were conducted poorly Mar 27, 2007 7:31:22 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: and like we said weed doesnt really play as big of a role as coke or X so many studies havent been done on it yet Mar 27, 2007 7:31:26 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and i can personally say...that i have known people who have been on the drug for WAY too long, and they deff have changed....not as smart and they dont care about stuff as much as they used to Mar 27, 2007 7:31:59 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: nicole how long do we have to go until the next topic? Mar 27, 2007 7:32:40 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: well that can possibly be true, but personal experience isnt scientific Mar 27, 2007 7:32:42 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i know Mar 27, 2007 7:32:51 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: like i still belive it should be legalized Mar 27, 2007 7:33:10 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and regulated Mar 27, 2007 7:33:15 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: ok Mar 27, 2007 7:33:28 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: it is just one of those things that will turn into a personal choice like smoking or drinking Mar 27, 2007 7:33:33 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: and how many topics do we have to do tonight? Mar 27, 2007 7:33:49 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: what do you mean by that Mar 27, 2007 7:33:50 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (there are two topics tonight) Mar 27, 2007 7:34:04 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: ok Mar 27, 2007 7:34:09 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: meaning that once it is legalize, if it is legalized...it will be a personal choice to people if they wish to do it or not Mar 27, 2007 7:34:23 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: and its not now? Mar 27, 2007 7:34:38 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: yea i was getting ready to say that Mar 27, 2007 7:34:54 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: how do you feel about the government regulating it's usage either a)in public or b)while driving or at work etc Mar 27, 2007 7:34:59 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: even though its not legalized its still a personal choice Mar 27, 2007 7:35:10 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: its just like laws against drunk driving Mar 27, 2007 7:35:17 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: yea i agree Mar 27, 2007 7:35:33 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: and workplaces can make their own rules regarding people being high at work Mar 27, 2007 7:35:42 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: people are gonna do it regardless Mar 27, 2007 7:35:42 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: and being high in public can be made illegal, just like being drunk in public Mar 27, 2007 7:36:21 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: just like they do now when they do drug tests Mar 27, 2007 7:36:24 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: what i ment was that some people dont smoke it now b/c it is illegal, but if made legal they would try it Mar 27, 2007 7:36:32 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: really? Mar 27, 2007 7:36:50 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: what people? Mar 27, 2007 7:36:54 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: haha people i know Mar 27, 2007 7:37:03 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: 40% of americans have already tried it Mar 27, 2007 7:37:09 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: but there is that 60% Mar 27, 2007 7:37:21 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: the point is, if it were a smaller percentage, like 5-10, it would be a different story Mar 27, 2007 7:37:50 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: and the other 60% are people that are older generation or children or people that have friends and see the effects on them and just dont do it Mar 27, 2007 7:37:56 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: or just losers Mar 27, 2007 7:38:16 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: haha Mar 27, 2007 7:38:22 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: lol Mar 27, 2007 7:38:23 PM EDT

CMC spacestare86: yeah....needles and such Mar 27, 2007 7:40:22 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i dont think so about the heroin part* Mar 27, 2007 7:40:24 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i feel like a persons attitudes towards drugs is based more on conditions surrounding you, how you were brought up, your morals...this doesnt changed based on government precedent Mar 27, 2007 7:40:37 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: and it creates holes in ur brain after usage of like a couple months Mar 27, 2007 7:40:47 PM EDT
