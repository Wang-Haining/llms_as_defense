Nicole Becker: Okay your first topic is gay marriage Mar 28, 2007 7:11:57 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: here's your discussion starter: Mar 28, 2007 7:12:08 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: In Maryland a conservative legislator said he backs a bill that would put an amendment on the ballot. THe amendment to the state constitution would define marriage to be between a man and a woman. Also 16 states have enacted bans on gays adopting children. Mar 28, 2007 7:12:08 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well i personally am completely for gay marraige, so i would definitely oppose both of these things. where do you guys stand on the issue? Mar 28, 2007 7:12:55 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: I have a few friends that are gay, so I'm for gay marriage. Mar 28, 2007 7:13:26 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I was against it for a while, but I eventually decided there is no reason for it to be illegal Mar 28, 2007 7:14:04 PM EDT
CMC rocks: why were you against if you don't mind my asking? Mar 28, 2007 7:14:26 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: The government really has no authority in deciding what is and is not marriage. Mar 28, 2007 7:14:29 PM EDT
CMC rocks: and what made you change your mind? Mar 28, 2007 7:14:35 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Hmm... Mar 28, 2007 7:14:35 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well I changed my mind after I thought about it for a while lol Mar 28, 2007 7:14:48 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I was originally against it because I thought it to be more natural for a man and a woman to be together. Mar 28, 2007 7:15:10 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i don't feel strongly either way. i'm definitely not opposed to it though. Mar 28, 2007 7:15:20 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but i'm not a huge advocate either Mar 28, 2007 7:15:32 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Ah. Mar 28, 2007 7:15:40 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Obviously that is still the case, but since it is not the choice of the individual to be gay, I don't think they should be denied love just because they were born a certain way. Mar 28, 2007 7:15:57 PM EDT
CMC rocks: that's an interesting perspective Mar 28, 2007 7:16:22 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: well to comment on that, they are not being denied LOVE....just the fact of a legal union of marriage Mar 28, 2007 7:16:28 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: True Mar 28, 2007 7:16:37 PM EDT
CMC rocks: so if it were the choice of the individual would it be different? Mar 28, 2007 7:16:39 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: But would it stand to reason that they deserve the same civil benefits as a heterosexual couple? Mar 28, 2007 7:16:54 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: wouldn't* Mar 28, 2007 7:17:01 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: if they're entitled to love Mar 28, 2007 7:17:17 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yes...i believe so Mar 28, 2007 7:17:25 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: If it were the choice of the individual, it would be different, yes. If everyone chose to be gay, then noone would reproduce. And we can't have that. ") Mar 28, 2007 7:17:39 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: = )* Mar 28, 2007 7:17:44 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: haha Mar 28, 2007 7:17:56 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well it's not very likely that everyone would choose to be gay Mar 28, 2007 7:18:08 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Probably not. Mar 28, 2007 7:18:24 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but i think if anyone did, we should allow them to Mar 28, 2007 7:18:42 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well hey, if you really want to think far into this.... if you say it is okay to do something, then you have to say it is okay for EVERYONE to do it Mar 28, 2007 7:19:24 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: So, are we now discussing whether or not being gay is a result of personal choice? Mar 28, 2007 7:20:20 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yes....and then you could run into the potential problem of two straight people of the same sex getting "married" for the tax perks that that could bring on Mar 28, 2007 7:20:25 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: (my "yes" was in response to goldeneye, not crashnburn's question fyi) Mar 28, 2007 7:20:52 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Crash, I think we are hypothetically thinking that being gay is a personal choice, yes Mar 28, 2007 7:21:00 PM EDT
CMC rocks: does anyone know if it's determined whether homosexuality is genetic or not? Mar 28, 2007 7:21:01 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: The gay gene Mar 28, 2007 7:21:15 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: I only asked because I wasn't sure of where everyone else stood. Mar 28, 2007 7:21:27 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Theres a talk here about it, I assume they have found it? Mar 28, 2007 7:21:35 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: well i know that today for spectrum week there was a speaker talking about the gay gene and it's social implications Mar 28, 2007 7:21:36 PM EDT
CMC rocks: ok i saw posters for that around campus Mar 28, 2007 7:21:36 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Isn't there someone coming to Loyola to give a talk about that? Mar 28, 2007 7:21:39 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: haha yes Mar 28, 2007 7:21:43 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Yep Mar 28, 2007 7:21:49 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Hey, I have a question. Do you think the government has the right to decide what a real "marriage" is? And where does religion fall in? Mar 28, 2007 7:22:08 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so i didn't go to it an don't know what exactly they said, but i feel that it is not a personal choice Mar 28, 2007 7:22:17 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I don't believe it is a personal choice either. It wouldn't make any sense for it to be personal choice. Who would choose a life of discrimination? Mar 28, 2007 7:23:12 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i could see people choosing that, maybe to be different, but i also think it is most likely genetic Mar 28, 2007 7:23:39 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: And have to go through the whole process of revealing it to your parents and everything. Mar 28, 2007 7:23:41 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah goldeneye...especially if you go back father into history when it was SO much more socially unacceptable Mar 28, 2007 7:24:16 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah, there were a lot of closet gays back in the day Mar 28, 2007 7:24:32 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well.... go back far enough and it was commonly practiced as well. Mar 28, 2007 7:24:36 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Right, like the Greeks Mar 28, 2007 7:24:47 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: this is true Mar 28, 2007 7:24:47 PM EDT
CMC rocks: so there is a lot of evidence for its being genetic Mar 28, 2007 7:25:02 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: It would make a lot more sense to me for it to be genetic. There would not be nearly as many homosexuals if it were not. Mar 28, 2007 7:25:33 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Therefore, it is like any other trait, and should not be discriminated against. Mar 28, 2007 7:26:06 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so we are all in agreement that it is genetic for the purposes of future discussion? Mar 28, 2007 7:26:21 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: lol Mar 28, 2007 7:26:27 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yes, i would say so Mar 28, 2007 7:26:45 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: lol right. Mar 28, 2007 7:26:49 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: The gay gene! Mar 28, 2007 7:26:59 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: ok so then was was the question that someone brought up that depended on whether it was personal choice or genetic?? Mar 28, 2007 7:27:15 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I have to go to that talk lol I'm interested to know Mar 28, 2007 7:27:16 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Has it already happened? Mar 28, 2007 7:27:26 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: too bad it's happening right now Mar 28, 2007 7:27:27 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Oh. Mar 28, 2007 7:27:36 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Oh Mar 28, 2007 7:27:36 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i was going to go BUT... Mar 28, 2007 7:27:36 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: lol Mar 28, 2007 7:27:40 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i'm here! Mar 28, 2007 7:27:40 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: so hey... answer my question Mar 28, 2007 7:28:18 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Do you think the government has the right to decide what a real "marriage" is? And where does religion fall in? Mar 28, 2007 7:28:19 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well maybe we should define marraige first Mar 28, 2007 7:28:32 PM EDT
CMC rocks: is it a legal union or just a union? Mar 28, 2007 7:28:40 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I am thinking more of just a union. I never thought about the legal implications, really. Mar 28, 2007 7:29:02 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: It has a bit of both aspects. Mar 28, 2007 7:29:02 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i didn't mean legal implications so much as the necessity of a union being legal for it to be considered marraige Mar 28, 2007 7:29:40 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Well, among other things, the legal part involves insurance benefits, say if one spouse were to die. Mar 28, 2007 7:29:55 PM EDT
CMC rocks: like can you be married if you are not legally bound to the person? Mar 28, 2007 7:29:56 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: well there are two different things....if you want to get married in a specific church (i'll use the catholic church as an example....but won't get too much into that now...save that for later!) you get married in the church and you ALSO need to get a legal marriage certificate Mar 28, 2007 7:30:02 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Right. Mar 28, 2007 7:30:22 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yes, so if you didn't have the legal certificate, is it marraige? Mar 28, 2007 7:30:30 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: legally no Mar 28, 2007 7:30:40 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Nope Mar 28, 2007 7:30:43 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: If gay marriage is okay, then I think it should be the same process as straight marriage. If you do not allow homosexuals to get married "legally," but allow them to just be in a "union" or whatever, it still is NOT equal. Mar 28, 2007 7:31:34 PM EDT
CMC rocks: so then the government does have a say in marraige Mar 28, 2007 7:31:39 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: It's just kind of... shutting them up. Mar 28, 2007 7:31:41 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Sounds reasonable. Mar 28, 2007 7:31:52 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah it should be the same for both Mar 28, 2007 7:32:12 PM EDT
CMC rocks: so if the govt is needed to make a marraige legal, then we need the govt to make a gay marraige legal Mar 28, 2007 7:32:34 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Ideally, yes. But, as we've seen here, there's a lot about it we don't understand, and without any experience, can only speculate about. Mar 28, 2007 7:32:54 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: isn't that the whole debate though, whether or not the GOVT will legalize it.....bc the catholic church at least certainly isn't, so getting "legally" married is the only "union" that they could have anyway Mar 28, 2007 7:33:38 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so yes rocks, the govt is needed in order to make it legal Mar 28, 2007 7:34:06 PM EDT
CMC rocks: so it's going to be unequel, no matter what, because the catholic church won't endorse it even if the govt does Mar 28, 2007 7:34:23 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: The Catholic Church is working on celibacy and female priests right now, I believe. : P Mar 28, 2007 7:34:33 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well, that would stand only for catholics, it could theoretically be equal in other religions provided the govt agrees Mar 28, 2007 7:34:46 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Is that true? Mar 28, 2007 7:35:01 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: and provided those religions agree as well Mar 28, 2007 7:35:04 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yes, that is what i mean Mar 28, 2007 7:35:12 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Ah Mar 28, 2007 7:35:14 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: and the catholic church is not the only churcht that doesn't Mar 28, 2007 7:35:17 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: So is there anyone opposed to gay marriage here? I heard someone say it before. If so, lets get some debate going! Mar 28, 2007 7:35:42 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so in response to goldeneye's original question about whether teh govt has the right to decide, since they decide for heterosexual couples, then they must also be the ones to decide for homosexual couples Mar 28, 2007 7:36:17 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: If not, then let's go over the reasons that people would cite against gay marriage. Mar 28, 2007 7:36:32 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: no i don't think that anyone said that they are Mar 28, 2007 7:36:37 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: (in response to Goldeneye) Mar 28, 2007 7:36:42 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah, i think we are all in agreement Mar 28, 2007 7:36:46 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I feel like they should not have the right to "decide," however. Mar 28, 2007 7:36:49 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: the government? Mar 28, 2007 7:36:59 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: who is they?? they govt? Mar 28, 2007 7:36:59 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: They should just "provide" the process. Mar 28, 2007 7:37:01 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Yes. Mar 28, 2007 7:37:07 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: That would make sense. Mar 28, 2007 7:37:11 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: well how can they provide it without having made the decision to endorse it? Mar 28, 2007 7:37:22 PM EDT
CMC rocks: what do you mean by provide the process, goldeneye? Mar 28, 2007 7:37:26 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Do you mean the legal routes? Mar 28, 2007 7:37:50 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: They never had to "endorse" straight marriage. It was always, naturally, there. Therefore, there should be no debate. As long as being gay is genetic, it is not something that should be discriminated against. Mar 28, 2007 7:38:29 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: oh....ok i see now what you are saying Mar 28, 2007 7:38:53 PM EDT
CMC rocks: so they should just let it happen like any other marraige Mar 28, 2007 7:39:16 PM EDT
CMC rocks: there should be no distinction Mar 28, 2007 7:39:21 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but then what is the difference there between "deciding" and "providing the process"? Mar 28, 2007 7:39:38 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well, what gives them the right to decide it is "wrong," if it is not by choice. Mar 28, 2007 7:39:42 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: ? Mar 28, 2007 7:39:42 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Providing the process involves no moral judgment, which I believe they have no right to make in an issue like this one. Mar 28, 2007 7:40:14 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: (did that make sense?) Mar 28, 2007 7:40:37 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Some also argue that there are certain environmental factors that contribute to a child's development of sexual identity. Given this, it might move this discussion beyond just genetics. Mar 28, 2007 7:40:45 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah i think so Mar 28, 2007 7:40:53 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: what sort of environmental factors? Mar 28, 2007 7:41:40 PM EDT
CMC rocks: do you think there are any non-genetic factors? Mar 28, 2007 7:41:44 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Hey, my parents are divorced, and I grew up in a house with all women. I turned out just fine, I think. Mar 28, 2007 7:42:16 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Is that the kind of thing we mean? Mar 28, 2007 7:42:26 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Not having both sexes around. Mar 28, 2007 7:42:38 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: ? Mar 28, 2007 7:42:42 PM EDT
CMC rocks: or having a homosexual family member? Mar 28, 2007 7:43:34 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: As did I, but I've read (though I'm not sure I agree with it) that, say a male child grew up around women who tended to be unstable Mar 28, 2007 7:43:35 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: This disposes him to be more comfortable around men. Mar 28, 2007 7:44:04 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: rocks, what do you mean? Mar 28, 2007 7:44:06 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well if you had a gay brother, say, would that influence your sexual orientation? Mar 28, 2007 7:44:31 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well that goes back to whether it is genetic or not Mar 28, 2007 7:44:50 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: well my question is does it matter whether being gay is genetic or not? like would that affect whether we support gay marriage?? Mar 28, 2007 7:45:08 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I do believe that people (teenagers, especially) can be influenced by something like that, and either become confused or, trying to be rebellious, "think" that they are gay. Mar 28, 2007 7:45:24 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i agree with that goldeneye Mar 28, 2007 7:45:45 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well i dont think it would affect my opinions Mar 28, 2007 7:46:01 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Yes clockwatcher, to me it would. Mar 28, 2007 7:46:09 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Makes sense. Mar 28, 2007 7:46:17 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: If it is proven to be just a choice and nothing more, then I say cut it out. Mar 28, 2007 7:46:32 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: It is not "natural" then, not something that is in your nature (your genetic code!). Mar 28, 2007 7:47:27 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: There are some places that offer "therapy" to gay people to potentially "turn them straight." Mar 28, 2007 7:48:05 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: What do you guys think about that? Mar 28, 2007 7:48:12 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i dont think that would ever work! Mar 28, 2007 7:48:15 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Some church groups do it though. Mar 28, 2007 7:48:23 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: I can't cite any specifically. Mar 28, 2007 7:48:31 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: If it is genetic, then that is just horrible, horrible torture for anyone to go through. Mar 28, 2007 7:48:31 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i HAVE heard of that before Mar 28, 2007 7:49:10 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: and i agree that if it is something genetic, then that is terrible Mar 28, 2007 7:49:36 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: A friend of mine was sent to a psychologist because he told his mom that he was gay. Mar 28, 2007 7:49:51 PM EDT
CMC rocks: thats terrible too! Mar 28, 2007 7:50:26 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well, then again, even it is genetic, I think a person can get confused during hard times in their life. Mar 28, 2007 7:50:43 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: That's true, but to treat it as a sort of "Detox" implies that you think of it as some sort of disease to begin with, Mar 28, 2007 7:51:09 PM EDT
CMC rocks: and that there would have to be something wrong with you Mar 28, 2007 7:51:33 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Right, even if someone is confused, I guess it would be better for them to discover their true feelings on their own. Mar 28, 2007 7:51:43 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yes Mar 28, 2007 7:51:49 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Or maybe with the gay gene, there will be a way to test it. Mar 28, 2007 7:51:56 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: But you're right, it is necessary to make sure that something like that is for real. It's not exactly a decision to be made lightly. Mar 28, 2007 7:52:05 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: What if someone does not have the gay gene and wants to be gay? Should that person's parents seek psychiatric help for him/her? Mar 28, 2007 7:52:33 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: if you don't work things out and instead just do what someone else tells you to, you might have feelings of regret, so i think that it's important for people to come to decisions about their sexual orientation on their own Mar 28, 2007 7:52:55 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Definitely. Mar 28, 2007 7:53:07 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: that's a very interesting question goldeneye Mar 28, 2007 7:53:15 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Right. Mar 28, 2007 7:53:21 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Thanks. = ) Mar 28, 2007 7:53:34 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I think I would say yes. Mar 28, 2007 7:54:15 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Because, again, it is not "natural" for that person. Mar 28, 2007 7:54:26 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so to bring back in the legal implications, if it is proven that there is a gay gene, should people need to be tested to see if they are "truly" gay before being allowed to marry? Mar 28, 2007 7:54:38 PM EDT
CMC rocks: well how would you determine if that person actually had the gay gene or were just faking it? Mar 28, 2007 7:54:41 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Well, this might not be directly related, but there is some controversy over handicapped parents seeking to give birth to handicapped children. They then go to genetecists and have gotten it done. Mar 28, 2007 7:54:49 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: Could a gay couple do the same? Mar 28, 2007 7:54:56 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well, I was assuming it was a proven gene that could be tested without a doubt. Mar 28, 2007 7:54:58 PM EDT
CMC rocks: ok Mar 28, 2007 7:55:11 PM EDT
