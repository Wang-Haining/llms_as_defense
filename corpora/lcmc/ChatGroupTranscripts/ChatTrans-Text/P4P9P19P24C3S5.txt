Melissa Carbone: your first topic is gender discrimination Apr 1, 2007 2:07:29 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: do you feel that it is still present in the US? Apr 1, 2007 2:07:38 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I feel that it is still present, but is working its way out in the present time period Apr 1, 2007 2:07:59 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: it being gender discrimination against women? Apr 1, 2007 2:08:24 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: that was the question Apr 1, 2007 2:08:38 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: no, the question was gender discrimination Apr 1, 2007 2:08:51 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Ok...women discriminatioin Apr 1, 2007 2:09:01 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: thanks, just checking Apr 1, 2007 2:09:09 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I feel that it's still very prevalent as well Apr 1, 2007 2:09:21 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Now that that is cleared up Apr 1, 2007 2:09:21 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: well not extremely prevalent Apr 1, 2007 2:09:29 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I think it is working its way out Apr 1, 2007 2:09:35 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: how so? Apr 1, 2007 2:09:39 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: well, it's better than it used to be certainly Apr 1, 2007 2:09:46 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: after all, it isnt a wise choice for employers to discriminate Apr 1, 2007 2:09:53 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: its costly Apr 1, 2007 2:10:00 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: More women in management positions in the workplace and better education about discrimination Apr 1, 2007 2:10:01 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: it's against the law for them to discriminate Apr 1, 2007 2:10:14 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Thus costly Apr 1, 2007 2:10:25 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: that's true, but if a man and a woman go up for the same position and are equally qualified who do you think would get the job? Apr 1, 2007 2:10:45 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: If some employer refuses to hire a woman with adequate skills, a competitor can hire her Apr 1, 2007 2:10:53 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: there are still certain fields where women are not in many top management positions, fields where it is difficult for women to advance Apr 1, 2007 2:10:57 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: especially if its a high rankig position Apr 1, 2007 2:10:59 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: thus, it is costly Apr 1, 2007 2:11:02 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: my dad works in the engineering field Apr 1, 2007 2:11:10 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: They would hire the women Apr 1, 2007 2:11:10 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and he always comments about the lack of women Apr 1, 2007 2:11:18 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: in high level positions Apr 1, 2007 2:11:23 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Some employers have a policy of affirmative action Apr 1, 2007 2:11:24 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yup Apr 1, 2007 2:11:32 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: if the same skill set is present Apr 1, 2007 2:11:36 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: they hire the minority Apr 1, 2007 2:11:41 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I think businesses today, for the most part, are most concerned with results Apr 1, 2007 2:12:02 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: you see it most blatantly in the govenment, the lack of women in positions of power Apr 1, 2007 2:12:20 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Its not like they don't have the opportunity Apr 1, 2007 2:12:40 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: We have a female secretary of state Apr 1, 2007 2:12:42 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: there is a female running for president Apr 1, 2007 2:12:47 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: only the second one in our 230 year history Apr 1, 2007 2:12:51 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: and besides, there have to be women running to vote for them Apr 1, 2007 2:12:52 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: If you run, and are a decent canidate Apr 1, 2007 2:13:03 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: they will vote for you Apr 1, 2007 2:13:05 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: you seem so sure of that Apr 1, 2007 2:13:29 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: You can't just appoint women to the government, in this democratic society you have to vote them in, thus making them present on a ballot Apr 1, 2007 2:13:35 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: do you think a woman president would get the same respect as a man? Apr 1, 2007 2:13:36 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: if she does a good job, yes Apr 1, 2007 2:13:48 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: exactly, and people aren't voting for women Apr 1, 2007 2:13:51 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: well 50% of the population has to be women Apr 1, 2007 2:13:51 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: if they care that it is that much of an issue, they can vote her in Apr 1, 2007 2:14:06 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Because they aren't there to run Apr 1, 2007 2:14:15 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: what about from other countries who aren't as advanced in equality of woman? Apr 1, 2007 2:14:17 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Chile Apr 1, 2007 2:14:26 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Women president Apr 1, 2007 2:14:31 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what do you mean? Apr 1, 2007 2:14:32 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what about them? Apr 1, 2007 2:14:39 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: ? Apr 1, 2007 2:14:43 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Margaret Thatcher was PM of Great Britain in the 80's Apr 1, 2007 2:14:58 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yes, I thought we were talking about the United States Apr 1, 2007 2:15:11 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well there are a lot of countries who still see woman as inferior, and a woman president would have to do business with these countries, would they still respect her the way they respected all our other presidents? Apr 1, 2007 2:15:23 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: it's just a question Apr 1, 2007 2:15:35 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: If they do not respect women, then probably not Apr 1, 2007 2:15:41 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: But if they want to have a good relationship with the most powerful country in the world, they might have to suck it up Apr 1, 2007 2:16:20 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: True enough Apr 1, 2007 2:16:35 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: Women in the government face disrespect even from members of the U.S. government Apr 1, 2007 2:17:32 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: example? Apr 1, 2007 2:17:42 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: What do you mean Apr 1, 2007 2:17:47 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: Within the past ten years, according to my AP government text book, male senators would belittle female senators, and not address them by their appropriate title Apr 1, 2007 2:18:07 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: during sessions of Congress, or hearings and things like that Apr 1, 2007 2:18:25 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I highly doubt that 100% of the male senators would do as such, and even so, we are only on the path to correction, we can not achieve it over night Apr 1, 2007 2:18:43 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Where did your AP gov book get its information Apr 1, 2007 2:19:03 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: speculation? Apr 1, 2007 2:19:07 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I think their professionalism would overcome gender discrimination Apr 1, 2007 2:19:24 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: no, transcripts of tapes of Congressional hearings Apr 1, 2007 2:19:28 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: pure fact Apr 1, 2007 2:19:41 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: And every single man met that standard you presented Apr 1, 2007 2:19:44 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: nope Apr 1, 2007 2:19:48 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Not pure fact Apr 1, 2007 2:19:53 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but as long as there's one, that's still a problem Apr 1, 2007 2:20:00 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: signs of respect are not necessarily universal Apr 1, 2007 2:20:04 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: how can you place a fact on something subjective Apr 1, 2007 2:20:09 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and we need to acknowledge that there's still a problem Apr 1, 2007 2:20:14 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: There are always going to be women discriminating men as well Apr 1, 2007 2:20:30 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: We have Apr 1, 2007 2:20:36 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: of course Apr 1, 2007 2:20:45 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: You think we have not addressed it at all? Apr 1, 2007 2:20:55 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: there's gender discrimination against boys in the education system Apr 1, 2007 2:21:01 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: ? Apr 1, 2007 2:21:14 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I mean, look at college campuses today, the majority is almost always female Apr 1, 2007 2:21:23 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: Time magazine reported in an article about elementary education that teachers were showing more attention to girls and their needs rather than the boys Apr 1, 2007 2:21:49 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Thats because more men take jobs after high school Apr 1, 2007 2:21:55 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: in a way overcompensating for the discrimination against women that used to be the standard Apr 1, 2007 2:22:18 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: and also like engineering schools have far more men the women Apr 1, 2007 2:22:19 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: that's discrimination against women Apr 1, 2007 2:22:30 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: That is not necessarily due to discrimination Apr 1, 2007 2:22:32 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: its just coincidental Apr 1, 2007 2:22:46 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I have seen studies where women do not prefer that major because of stereotypes set forth, such as being "geeky" Apr 1, 2007 2:22:53 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah it's due to the fact that theres more men in the field Apr 1, 2007 2:22:56 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: What? Apr 1, 2007 2:23:03 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: its an individual choice whether and wher to attend college Apr 1, 2007 2:23:03 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: One you get into a school you can chose which field to study Apr 1, 2007 2:23:17 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: There are more girls per campus, so why not just chose that major Apr 1, 2007 2:23:31 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: because perhaps there is pressure not to Apr 1, 2007 2:23:43 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: It is individual choice, and they just are not chosing those majors Apr 1, 2007 2:23:45 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah i dont think the ratio of males to females in college necessarily have anything to do with discrimmination Apr 1, 2007 2:23:47 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: So perhaps it shows weakness if you succumb to pressure Apr 1, 2007 2:24:07 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: There are all sorts of pressures in our life Apr 1, 2007 2:24:21 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: If we back down everytime we meet a little pressure, we will never get where we want to Apr 1, 2007 2:24:32 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I'm just suggesting that perhaps certain general attitudes towards men or women may be a factor in the disarity between the number of males and females that attend college, it's just a thought Apr 1, 2007 2:24:36 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: disparity*, excuse me Apr 1, 2007 2:24:46 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: but it's also been proven that men are better at math and science which goes along with engineering Apr 1, 2007 2:24:52 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: um, how exactly has that been proven? Apr 1, 2007 2:25:07 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: studies and such Apr 1, 2007 2:25:16 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Some positions are just better suited for men Apr 1, 2007 2:25:19 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: you've never heard that? Apr 1, 2007 2:25:25 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Men and women are physically different Apr 1, 2007 2:25:32 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yup, women are biologically stronger Apr 1, 2007 2:25:49 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: No Apr 1, 2007 2:26:03 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: nope, i've never heard of those studies Apr 1, 2007 2:26:04 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yup Apr 1, 2007 2:26:05 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: How so? Apr 1, 2007 2:26:11 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: can you support another life? Apr 1, 2007 2:26:12 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah, and women excell in like language related fields like english and such Apr 1, 2007 2:26:15 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: for nine months? Apr 1, 2007 2:26:16 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: not all women, not all men Apr 1, 2007 2:26:27 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: That has nothing to do with strength Apr 1, 2007 2:26:29 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: stereotype Apr 1, 2007 2:26:30 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i'm not saying it's true for everyone Apr 1, 2007 2:26:37 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: just for the majority Apr 1, 2007 2:26:43 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i would beg to differ Apr 1, 2007 2:26:52 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Men are, in general, stronger than women Apr 1, 2007 2:26:53 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: you cant deny that fact Apr 1, 2007 2:27:03 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i'm not, i'm just saying that they're biologically stronger Apr 1, 2007 2:27:21 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: you can't deny that fact Apr 1, 2007 2:27:27 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: what consitutes biological strength, then? Apr 1, 2007 2:27:37 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: their ability to support life Apr 1, 2007 2:28:02 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I'm not following Apr 1, 2007 2:28:15 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Do you know what biology means? Apr 1, 2007 2:28:24 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yes, the study of life, living organisms and vital processes Apr 1, 2007 2:29:17 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: women have babies, men don't, that's all i'm saying Apr 1, 2007 2:29:36 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: so then how does your definition of biological strength only support the idea of supporting another life Apr 1, 2007 2:29:41 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: You are also saying that is pure biological strength Apr 1, 2007 2:29:50 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I dont think thats pertinent to strength Apr 1, 2007 2:30:11 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i don't think I completely understand what you mean Apr 1, 2007 2:30:14 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: when you say pure biological strength Apr 1, 2007 2:30:26 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: You are saying biological strength only deals with the ability to produce another life Apr 1, 2007 2:30:48 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I disagree Apr 1, 2007 2:30:50 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: oh i'm sorry, that is not what I meant, I just meant it's a big part of it, more vital to life than physical strength Apr 1, 2007 2:31:44 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i have a question Apr 1, 2007 2:32:49 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: is it gender discrimination to exclude women from military drafts? Apr 1, 2007 2:33:05 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: For both genders Apr 1, 2007 2:33:17 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: No Apr 1, 2007 2:33:20 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: no Apr 1, 2007 2:33:27 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: because women are less capable soldiers Apr 1, 2007 2:33:35 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: infantry, at least Apr 1, 2007 2:33:46 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: may i ask why? Apr 1, 2007 2:33:50 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: If I'm fighting in a war, I would rather have a man fighting beside me than a woman Apr 1, 2007 2:34:19 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Men are stronger Apr 1, 2007 2:34:33 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i agree women are less capable, and i don't think a lot of women would be able to handle the physical exertion Apr 1, 2007 2:34:40 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i know women who are stronger than men Apr 1, 2007 2:34:41 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I'm saying for the most part Apr 1, 2007 2:34:54 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i'm saying what about those women who are stronger Apr 1, 2007 2:35:18 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: then if they want to join the war they can Apr 1, 2007 2:35:30 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: but there are many many many more women who are not capable than are Apr 1, 2007 2:35:44 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: But we cant have a draft that puts women in combat positions Apr 1, 2007 2:35:49 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: question, are womne allowed to participate in combat? Apr 1, 2007 2:35:51 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: women* excuse me Apr 1, 2007 2:36:03 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: They can operate combat vehicles like aircraft and tanks Apr 1, 2007 2:36:28 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: because physical strength is not a factor in those cases Apr 1, 2007 2:36:50 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: ah, so what if we had a draft that didn't place women in combat positions Apr 1, 2007 2:37:11 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: that would be acceptable Apr 1, 2007 2:37:23 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Certainly Apr 1, 2007 2:37:27 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah i think that would be fair Apr 1, 2007 2:37:32 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i see, so what do you think of the Israeli army Apr 1, 2007 2:38:14 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: made up of both women and men Apr 1, 2007 2:38:18 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: ? Apr 1, 2007 2:38:24 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Israel's a different story Apr 1, 2007 2:38:31 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: how so? Apr 1, 2007 2:38:36 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I would imagine a smaller population for one Apr 1, 2007 2:38:43 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: can't afford a fully male army Apr 1, 2007 2:38:47 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: with a far smaller population than the US, they expect everyone to participate in the military if necessary Apr 1, 2007 2:38:59 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i see Apr 1, 2007 2:39:12 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: And they are surrounded by Arabs who dont like their presence in the Middle east Apr 1, 2007 2:39:50 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: By the way, just thought I'd mention that the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission received 23, 247 charges of sex-based discrimination in 2006 Apr 1, 2007 2:42:33 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Point being Apr 1, 2007 2:42:48 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Is it possible that any of them are men as well? Apr 1, 2007 2:43:08 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: gender discrimination = problem that still needs addressing Apr 1, 2007 2:43:09 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: sure it's possible Apr 1, 2007 2:43:19 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: No one here claimed is was not still a problem Apr 1, 2007 2:43:21 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Does it show past data Apr 1, 2007 2:43:24 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: How should we address it? Apr 1, 2007 2:43:26 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: do you have a trend to show us Apr 1, 2007 2:43:29 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: We are addressing it via education in college's with emphasis on the topic as well as affirmative action hiring practices Apr 1, 2007 2:44:05 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well i mean we can instate a numerous amojnt of laws saying that women have to be treated equally but that doesn't mean its going to change peoples mentality and as long as that's there discimmination will always be here Apr 1, 2007 2:45:44 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: 2005 - 23,094, 2004 - 24, 249, 2003 - 24,362, 2002 - 25,536, 2001 - 25,140, 2000 - 25, 194, 1999 - 23, 907, 1998 - 24,454, 1997 - 24,728 Apr 1, 2007 2:45:54 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Have early dates Apr 1, 2007 2:47:00 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: going back into the 80s? Apr 1, 2007 2:47:04 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I think mentality can be changed Apr 1, 2007 2:47:22 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: You do not think so Janada? Apr 1, 2007 2:47:43 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: no that's like saying racial discrimmination won't always be here Apr 1, 2007 2:48:13 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: no, it only goes back to 1992 Apr 1, 2007 2:48:17 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Oh, alright Apr 1, 2007 2:48:24 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: which is, 21, 796 Apr 1, 2007 2:48:30 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: So Janada, can you clarify your point from before Apr 1, 2007 2:48:49 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i mean our society used to treat and believe women to be inferior, that kind of mentality doesn't just miraculously disapear Apr 1, 2007 2:49:53 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: look at television, there are some shows that have part of their plot based on the fact that women are inferior Apr 1, 2007 2:50:26 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Right, it will not happen overnight, I agree with that, but I also believe we are in the process of getting rid of it, do you not? Apr 1, 2007 2:50:26 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: sexist jokes Apr 1, 2007 2:50:28 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: it's a long process Apr 1, 2007 2:50:39 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I see many sexist jokes against men as well Apr 1, 2007 2:50:41 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: oh i definitely believe in it Apr 1, 2007 2:50:43 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: but i don't think it's possible for it to completely go away Apr 1, 2007 2:50:58 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: There will always be those peopl Apr 1, 2007 2:51:11 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: people Apr 1, 2007 2:51:13 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but I think citing sexist jokes might be off the mark as that spreads to men as well Apr 1, 2007 2:51:24 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: and also you have to think about immigration, people that come here from like middle eastern countries and such that don't see women as equal come here and start families and instate that belief all over again Apr 1, 2007 2:51:54 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: well, i think that there's discrimination against both men and women Apr 1, 2007 2:52:05 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Perhaps, but I would argue that mentality stays within their "clan" or family group Apr 1, 2007 2:52:20 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I do not think that mentality would really bother either of you Apr 1, 2007 2:52:32 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: wait, i'm sorry, what are you talking about? Apr 1, 2007 2:52:47 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but I suppose if they were in a power position, I could see the affects you speak of Apr 1, 2007 2:52:48 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: The middle-eastern mentality Apr 1, 2007 2:53:00 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: okay, and what about that? Apr 1, 2007 2:53:10 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Read what I just wrote Apr 1, 2007 2:53:19 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah but if someone with that belief is working in an office under a woman you'll have gender discrimmination in the work place all over again Apr 1, 2007 2:53:33 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Right, that's where I agree Apr 1, 2007 2:53:45 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but I think that our system is trying to work on shaping leaders without that mentality Apr 1, 2007 2:53:56 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: and it will take time Apr 1, 2007 2:53:58 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Thats why someone like that wouldnt get votes in the US Apr 1, 2007 2:54:12 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: wait, so you're saying that gender discrimination wouldn't bother me unless I'm directly affected by it? Apr 1, 2007 2:54:21 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: No Apr 1, 2007 2:54:42 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I'm sorry, I still don't understand your point about the middle eastern mentality Apr 1, 2007 2:54:54 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I am saying that if that person just has that mentality but has no power over you, it probably would not bother you Apr 1, 2007 2:55:03 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: exactly, if someone discriminates against women, it wouldn' t bother me unless they discriminated agains me personally Apr 1, 2007 2:55:46 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Well, in a way that could hurt your progress Apr 1, 2007 2:55:58 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what? Apr 1, 2007 2:56:14 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: if someone just came up to you and said you were not intelligent because you were a woman, would you really care? He is probably not intelligent to even make such a problem and such a statement can not hurt you Apr 1, 2007 2:56:37 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yes i would Apr 1, 2007 2:56:59 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Well perhaps this is another gender difference Apr 1, 2007 2:57:07 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what do you mean? Apr 1, 2007 2:57:15 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I would not let comments like that impede my progress or take it to heart Apr 1, 2007 2:57:18 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Maybe women are just too sensitive Apr 1, 2007 2:57:29 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i'm not saying i would let it impede my progress Apr 1, 2007 2:57:34 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Why would it bother you Apr 1, 2007 2:57:51 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Who cares Apr 1, 2007 2:57:53 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i'm just saying that I care about discriminatory views Apr 1, 2007 2:57:53 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: as long as he holds no power over you Apr 1, 2007 2:57:57 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah but at the same time those words would hold a lot more weight for a woman because gender discrimmnation is more a part of her past than a man's Apr 1, 2007 2:58:14 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: well, he must hold power over someone Apr 1, 2007 2:58:19 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: not really Apr 1, 2007 2:58:26 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: excuse me, might* Apr 1, 2007 2:58:38 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: ok Apr 1, 2007 2:58:46 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so, you're saying that middle eastern men don't treat women equally Apr 1, 2007 2:59:43 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and that you don't care about that Apr 1, 2007 2:59:50 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: because it doesn't affect you? Apr 1, 2007 3:00:08 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: No one said that Apr 1, 2007 3:00:18 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I'm sorry, I'm just trying to fully understand your point Apr 1, 2007 3:00:22 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I am just saying if someone insulted me based on my gender, but could not really do anything to hold that difference over me from a power position, I would not care Apr 1, 2007 3:00:49 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: There will always be people with different views, and if I let that bother me it will just eat away my life Apr 1, 2007 3:01:08 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I see, and if they have a power position over someone else, and they abuse it, would you feel the need to care? Apr 1, 2007 3:01:50 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yes Apr 1, 2007 3:02:12 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: that is what my statement says Apr 1, 2007 3:02:16 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: ok, thank you for clarifying Apr 1, 2007 3:02:49 PM EDT
