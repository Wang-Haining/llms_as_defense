Nicole Becker: well then.. onto the legalization of marijuana Apr 18, 2007 9:26:14 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: ah Apr 18, 2007 9:26:27 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: some groups found this little discussion starter slightly confusing... if it's too confusing I guess just give your thoughts on the legalization of marijuana in general Apr 18, 2007 9:26:40 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: 12 states allow the medicinal sale of marijuana. Oversight is lax and there are few specific guidelines for buyers and sellers of a drug still illegal under federal law. IN CA some clinic owners are making big bucks. The DEA is cracking down and is raiding some clinics. Apr 18, 2007 9:26:49 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: i would say no, but many places have already legalized it Apr 18, 2007 9:26:50 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: right Apr 18, 2007 9:26:53 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i think its hard to legalize it for medicinal use only. how do you enforce that? Apr 18, 2007 9:28:14 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: well i think that the discussion starter brings up one of the problems of legalizing marijuana for medicinal use only....its extremely difficult to inforce this Apr 18, 2007 9:28:24 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: well, some places have legalized it for recreational use Apr 18, 2007 9:28:40 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: if you're over 21 Apr 18, 2007 9:28:46 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I agree with that. Apr 18, 2007 9:29:12 PM EDT
CMC rocks: some states did? Apr 18, 2007 9:30:05 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: with what, goldeneye? Apr 18, 2007 9:30:07 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: i believe so Apr 18, 2007 9:30:23 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: we brought it up in our discussion group Apr 18, 2007 9:30:29 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Legalization of marijuana for recreational use, either for people over 18 or over 21. Apr 18, 2007 9:30:35 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: i know that arizona and california have done it for medicinal uses Apr 18, 2007 9:30:44 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: they did that in 96 Apr 18, 2007 9:30:57 PM EDT
CMC rocks: oh wow thats a while ago Apr 18, 2007 9:31:27 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah i didn't realize that Apr 18, 2007 9:31:33 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: right, so lots of people are claiming that as a precedent Apr 18, 2007 9:31:43 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: So what do you guys think, it shouldn't be legalized? Apr 18, 2007 9:32:18 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: plus, internationally, it is legal in spain, italy, and belgium Apr 18, 2007 9:32:38 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: to name a few Apr 18, 2007 9:32:41 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Not legal Apr 18, 2007 9:32:49 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Decriminalized Apr 18, 2007 9:32:52 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: ah, sorry Apr 18, 2007 9:32:57 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: what's the difference? Apr 18, 2007 9:33:00 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah, it's a big draw to going abroad for some people Apr 18, 2007 9:33:03 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well, in Spain. Apr 18, 2007 9:33:03 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I don't know about the other two countries. Apr 18, 2007 9:33:11 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: The difference is that if it were legal there would be no penalties at all for doing it. To decriminalize it means it is not considered a criminal act. Apr 18, 2007 9:34:22 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: As in if you are caught smoking marijuana in Spain, it is just a fine. Apr 18, 2007 9:34:39 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: so, are there still penalties Apr 18, 2007 9:34:42 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: ah, ok Apr 18, 2007 9:34:44 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: No criminal charge is brought against you. Apr 18, 2007 9:34:49 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: ok that's interesting...i didn't know that Apr 18, 2007 9:35:06 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: i didn't either Apr 18, 2007 9:35:12 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so can you purchase it legally? Apr 18, 2007 9:35:16 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but its a lot more accessible Apr 18, 2007 9:35:22 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but you're not allowed to smoke it? Apr 18, 2007 9:35:27 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I'm not sure. Apr 18, 2007 9:36:19 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I think to have it constitutes a fine, but don't quote me. Apr 18, 2007 9:36:46 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so it's really NOT completely legal Apr 18, 2007 9:37:05 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: No, just decriminalized. Apr 18, 2007 9:37:24 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I only know that for sure in Spain though. Apr 18, 2007 9:37:29 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: And I know in Amsterdam you can carry up to a certain amount legally. Apr 18, 2007 9:37:43 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: i've heard that too Apr 18, 2007 9:37:52 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah the netherlands are usually the most commonly cited example Apr 18, 2007 9:38:02 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: though i'm not sure what a "legal amount" would be Apr 18, 2007 9:38:04 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I think it's a pretty small amount. Apr 18, 2007 9:38:15 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i know you are allowed to smoke in public places there though Apr 18, 2007 9:38:27 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Okay, we're just kind of sharing information here. lol I think marijuana should be fully legal. What do you guys think? Apr 18, 2007 9:39:37 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but i think unless you had reason to be searched, you could easily get away with carrying large amounts Apr 18, 2007 9:39:47 PM EDT
CMC rocks: so how does anyone become a dealer? Apr 18, 2007 9:40:03 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: i don't think it should be Apr 18, 2007 9:40:05 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Why? Apr 18, 2007 9:40:13 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: health effects Apr 18, 2007 9:40:24 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i honestly don't know what i think. my initial gut feeling was that i was against it, but i was the only one in my dicussion group of that opinion and i totally got shot down Apr 18, 2007 9:40:37 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: and it warps your judgment Apr 18, 2007 9:40:38 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: So does alcohol. Apr 18, 2007 9:40:45 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i couldn't defend my reasoning Apr 18, 2007 9:40:47 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: right, but it seems that alcohol has staying power because it's more traditionalized (assuming that's a word) than marijuana Apr 18, 2007 9:41:08 PM EDT
CMC rocks: yeah i just think its bad enough so that it shouldnt be legal Apr 18, 2007 9:41:23 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Bad enough? Apr 18, 2007 9:41:36 PM EDT
CMC rocks: staying power? Apr 18, 2007 9:41:38 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: haha Apr 18, 2007 9:41:49 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: lol Apr 18, 2007 9:41:51 PM EDT
CMC rocks: its more harmful to you than alcohol i mean Apr 18, 2007 9:42:02 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: No, it's not. Apr 18, 2007 9:42:12 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Alcohol has proven lasting physical effects, many of which lead to death. Marijuana has no proven lasting effects. Apr 18, 2007 9:42:44 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Except, of course, the effect on your lungs. Apr 18, 2007 9:43:03 PM EDT
CMC rocks: it can cause breathing problems, heart palpitations, memory loss Apr 18, 2007 9:43:26 PM EDT
CMC rocks: and cancer just like smoking Apr 18, 2007 9:43:49 PM EDT
CMC rocks: which is interesting bc tobacco is legal in any amount Apr 18, 2007 9:44:11 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah exactly....i was just going to say that in terms of the lung effects....cigarettesare certainly known to be very harmful, yet they are perfectly legal Apr 18, 2007 9:44:46 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: That's why it does not make sense to keep marijuana illegal. Apr 18, 2007 9:45:38 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: well, its more harmful than tobacco smoke Apr 18, 2007 9:46:36 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Alcohol and cigarettes both have their different negative effects, so what's the difference? Apr 18, 2007 9:46:43 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: but why should we endorse harmful things Apr 18, 2007 9:46:55 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i mean if someone wants to do something, they're going to, but we might as well not make it easier Apr 18, 2007 9:47:32 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Typically though, you would smoke a lot less marijuana than cigarettes in a given day. Apr 18, 2007 9:47:33 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but it doesnt mean its effects are less - you just smoke less because it's stronger Apr 18, 2007 9:48:08 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I know that. thats what I am saying. Apr 18, 2007 9:48:20 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: don't people retain it in their lungs longer to get a better effect Apr 18, 2007 9:49:57 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so goldeneye, are you trying tosay that it would be less harmful for your lungs bc you don't smoke as often Apr 18, 2007 9:50:11 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: ? Apr 18, 2007 9:50:20 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Yes, Crash, people do. Thats personal choice though. Apr 18, 2007 9:50:35 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Yes Apr 18, 2007 9:50:52 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: clock Apr 18, 2007 9:50:54 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: k' Apr 18, 2007 9:51:01 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Agree? Disagree? Apr 18, 2007 9:51:15 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: ok Apr 18, 2007 9:52:33 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i don't know...i'm not an expert on the effects, i just wanted to make sure i undertsood what you were saying Apr 18, 2007 9:53:02 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Oh, okay Apr 18, 2007 9:53:25 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: haha sorry Apr 18, 2007 9:53:41 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: No problem :) Apr 18, 2007 9:54:08 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: so.... Apr 18, 2007 9:54:32 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: anyone? Apr 18, 2007 9:54:45 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: So I say as long as alcohol and cigarettes are legal, marijuana should be legalized. Apr 18, 2007 9:54:51 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: what sort of restrictions do you think there should be? Apr 18, 2007 9:55:26 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I guess make it age 18, like cigarettes. Apr 18, 2007 9:56:13 PM EDT
CMC rocks: amount? Apr 18, 2007 9:57:09 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i think it would need to be 21, because the effects are more similar to alcohol Apr 18, 2007 9:57:20 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: do you think that legalizing marijuana would cause more Apr 18, 2007 9:57:25 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: like Apr 18, 2007 9:57:33 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: No restriction on amount. Apr 18, 2007 9:57:41 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: other debates, surrounding legalizing other drugs Apr 18, 2007 9:57:42 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: no restriction?? Apr 18, 2007 9:57:54 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i disagree with that Apr 18, 2007 9:58:18 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well, wait. Apr 18, 2007 9:58:19 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: No restriction on amount. Apr 18, 2007 9:58:24 PM EDT
CMC rocks: why not? Apr 18, 2007 9:58:37 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I think it should have the same restrictions as alcohol in terms of things like, say, driving a car. Apr 18, 2007 9:58:44 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well, if its legal, why should there be a restriction on amount? Apr 18, 2007 9:59:05 PM EDT
CMC rocks: so people don't go out of control Apr 18, 2007 9:59:37 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Out of control? Apr 18, 2007 10:00:13 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: overuse? Apr 18, 2007 10:00:21 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well, what about alcohol? Apr 18, 2007 10:00:33 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: It is up to the individual to control their use, isn't it? Apr 18, 2007 10:00:53 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: didn't you cite other countries as precedent and say that there ARE some restrictions on amt? Apr 18, 2007 10:02:01 PM EDT
CMC rocks: that's true... but I don't know if it's always a good idea. I think less people might have dies of alcohol poisoning if there had been an enforced limit. Apr 18, 2007 10:02:22 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Well those countries have taken steps towards legalization. We are talking about if it is fully legal. Apr 18, 2007 10:03:02 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: And I didn't cite them as precedents, really. lol Apr 18, 2007 10:03:15 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Right, rocks. Apr 18, 2007 10:03:52 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: So why isn't there any restrictions? Apr 18, 2007 10:03:57 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: aren't* Apr 18, 2007 10:04:00 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: well goldeneye, do you think that this should be a gradual legalization process or just jump right into full legalization? Apr 18, 2007 10:04:46 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Gradual is always best. Apr 18, 2007 10:05:03 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: how feasible would it be? Apr 18, 2007 10:05:14 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yeah that's what i think Apr 18, 2007 10:05:16 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Quite feasible. I think now I will cite Spain and the other countries now. = P Apr 18, 2007 10:06:02 PM EDT
CMC rocks: do you think legalizing it will minimize its use? Apr 18, 2007 10:06:22 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: haha ok Apr 18, 2007 10:06:27 PM EDT
CMC rocks: there won't be that thrill factor Apr 18, 2007 10:06:37 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Thats an interesting question, I have no idea. Apr 18, 2007 10:06:47 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I agree with that though, it will definitely lose a lot of teenagers with the thrill factor gone, like you said. Apr 18, 2007 10:07:20 PM EDT
CMC rocks: so thats not you motivation for legalizing it? I think it is a common argument for its legalization. Apr 18, 2007 10:07:30 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i think that initially there will be an increase Apr 18, 2007 10:07:33 PM EDT
CMC rocks: true Apr 18, 2007 10:07:40 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but then it will wear off Apr 18, 2007 10:07:52 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: right Apr 18, 2007 10:08:06 PM EDT
CMC rocks: so goldeneye, what are your reasons for wanting it legaliuzed? Apr 18, 2007 10:08:13 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: My motivation for its legalization is that it should be personal choice to use a substance that is just as harmful, in many respects, as two other legal substances. Apr 18, 2007 10:08:49 PM EDT
CMC rocks: okay Apr 18, 2007 10:09:03 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: fair enough Apr 18, 2007 10:09:42 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: ok Apr 18, 2007 10:10:13 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Hey crash, you said something before that was interesting but I missed it. It was something like "Will marijuana's legalization lead to debates on legalizing other drugs?" Apr 18, 2007 10:10:53 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: What do you guys think? Apr 18, 2007 10:11:09 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: i think its possible Apr 18, 2007 10:11:57 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: well i think that other drugs are much more harmful, so you can't even try to put them into the same category as alcohol or cigarettes Apr 18, 2007 10:12:13 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: and since that seems to be the reasoning for why to legalize marijuana, i don't think that you can extend this to other drugs Apr 18, 2007 10:12:54 PM EDT
CMC rocks: but i think they are already in the same category of illegal drugs, so if one becomes legal, others might too Apr 18, 2007 10:13:13 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I think it definitely could. I don't know of any other drugs I would want to have legalized, however. Anything that causes physical dependence is a no-no. Apr 18, 2007 10:13:16 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: but i think that some people would be trying to make the case for other drugs Apr 18, 2007 10:13:19 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i think it would or could follow Apr 18, 2007 10:13:41 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Wait, I need to modify that. Apr 18, 2007 10:13:42 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: go ahead Apr 18, 2007 10:14:01 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Thats true, its a hard question. Apr 18, 2007 10:14:03 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: well i'll say that while im at least OPEN to the possiblitiy of marijuana, i am 100% against the legalization of anything else Apr 18, 2007 10:14:52 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: I think, for one, the word drug is very broad. I only know of a few drugs, like heroin and cocaine, and there are effects are just too major to ever be legalized. Apr 18, 2007 10:15:17 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Plus the physical dependence factor. Apr 18, 2007 10:15:26 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i have a question for the group Apr 18, 2007 10:16:04 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: So yeah, I agree with you guys on that one. Apr 18, 2007 10:16:11 PM EDT
CMC rocks: is the fact that marijuanaa gatweay drug a reason why you would not want it legalized? Apr 18, 2007 10:16:39 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Hmmm..... Apr 18, 2007 10:17:21 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: yes.....i think that once the thrill of marijuana is gone, people will still want to get that thrill somewhere else, so they will move onto something else Apr 18, 2007 10:17:34 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: (people who might have been content with marijuana while it wasn't legal, will no longer be satisfied with that) Apr 18, 2007 10:18:05 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: i agree with that Apr 18, 2007 10:19:05 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i don't know about that.. i thin kit's addictive qualities are the same regardless of its legal status Apr 18, 2007 10:19:26 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: For one, I think since (if it is legal) it will be the one legal drug, a lot of people will only do that and not risk breaking the law. Apr 18, 2007 10:19:33 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: And also, marijuana is a gateway drug in the sense that people try it, find it to be not too scary, and think they can handle more. That is more of a problem of drug education. Apr 18, 2007 10:20:39 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: rocks, i agree with what you're saying about its addictive qualities, but i'm talking about WHY people do it....more people might try other drugs instead because marijuana no longer will provide the thrill that it used to Apr 18, 2007 10:22:06 PM EDT
CMC rocks: ok Apr 18, 2007 10:22:35 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i agree, goldeneye Apr 18, 2007 10:22:44 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: perhaps Apr 18, 2007 10:22:59 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: What do you guys mean by "addictive qualities"? Apr 18, 2007 10:23:16 PM EDT
CMC rocks: i guess i mean the fact that it could lead to other drugs Apr 18, 2007 10:23:34 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Oh Apr 18, 2007 10:23:41 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: Okay Apr 18, 2007 10:23:50 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (last thoughts...) Apr 18, 2007 10:25:01 PM EDT
CMC rocks: nope Apr 18, 2007 10:25:17 PM EDT
CMC clockwatcher555: i'm done Apr 18, 2007 10:25:22 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: No, ma'am. Apr 18, 2007 10:25:42 PM EDT
CMC CrashNburn321: im good Apr 18, 2007 10:25:47 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: ? Apr 18, 2007 10:27:14 PM EDT
CMC Goldeneye: ?!?!??!11?!1one1!??
