CMC livingdeadbeat87: there probably could be more offensive gay jokes... Apr 3, 2007 7:54:17 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: In Maryland,a conservative legislator said he backs a bill that would put an amendment on the ballot. The amendment to the state constitution would define marriage to be between a man and a woman. Sixteen other states have enacted bans on gays adopting children as well. Apr 3, 2007 7:54:19 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: thats a bunch of bull Apr 3, 2007 7:54:45 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: wow Apr 3, 2007 7:54:46 PM EDT

CMC sun_beauty: why are they so concerned with other ppl's lives? Apr 3, 2007 7:55:06 PM EDT

CMC sun_beauty: that makes me feel alot better when i think about Apr 3, 2007 7:57:37 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: yea they arent but slowly they are realizes that our generation is gonna do whateva we want and we dont care Apr 3, 2007 7:58:16 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: they always argue how it isnt natural Apr 3, 2007 7:58:22 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: realizing* Apr 3, 2007 7:58:32 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i kno Apr 3, 2007 7:58:52 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and i mean, it prob isn't , but who am i to say what people can and cant do Apr 3, 2007 7:58:55 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: it might not be natural, but who gives a shit Apr 3, 2007 7:59:04 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: its a somewhat valid argument, but it still shouldnt impede on peoples rights Apr 3, 2007 7:59:04 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i am not going to go up to some of my friends and be like Apr 3, 2007 7:59:05 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: ur a freak...cause i dont see them that way Apr 3, 2007 7:59:14 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: exactly i feel that thats our generations motto Apr 3, 2007 7:59:15 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: who is the govt do decide these things? Apr 3, 2007 7:59:50 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: our generation is not concerned with other ppls lives like the older generation is Apr 3, 2007 8:00:00 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: the govt is just people tho Apr 3, 2007 8:00:09 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: and there are alot of people who are against gay marriage Apr 3, 2007 8:00:21 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: but those ppl dont represent us though Apr 3, 2007 8:00:25 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: like we all agreed on b/f....the govt is not too good at solving prob or being open minded Apr 3, 2007 8:00:25 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: so tru Apr 3, 2007 8:00:44 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: me and u spacestare!!! Apr 3, 2007 8:00:52 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: this is true the govt is (are?) people Apr 3, 2007 8:00:55 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: haha totally Apr 3, 2007 8:00:59 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: u taking the words right out of my mouth Apr 3, 2007 8:01:02 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: they might not represent US, but they represent millions of people Apr 3, 2007 8:01:03 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah...they do Apr 3, 2007 8:01:11 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i understand that the govt is made up of representatives from each state, but should our policy really be that if over half the country believes something it should be so? Apr 3, 2007 8:01:49 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: so perhaps the "marriage" should be called something diff, so that those who feel it is wrong wont get offended Apr 3, 2007 8:01:50 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: its just sad that people feel so inclined to keep gays separate from heterosexuals Apr 3, 2007 8:01:55 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i kno Apr 3, 2007 8:02:23 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: sometimes i feel that sometimes gays arent seen as humans but the govt Apr 3, 2007 8:02:40 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: or maybe even less than human Apr 3, 2007 8:02:48 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: before we even get to seperation though, we have to get to "seperate but equal" Apr 3, 2007 8:02:53 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: just becuz of their lifestyle Apr 3, 2007 8:02:54 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: tru Apr 3, 2007 8:03:13 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: separate but equal doesnt make anyone happy tho, does it? Apr 3, 2007 8:03:28 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: besides maybe the govt Apr 3, 2007 8:03:38 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: no, but im saying marriage is a fundamental right of humans, it should be an equal right for everyone Apr 3, 2007 8:03:44 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: tru Apr 3, 2007 8:04:04 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: yea Apr 3, 2007 8:04:05 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: this isnt a separation issue, its an equality issue Apr 3, 2007 8:04:08 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: yea thats how i see it Apr 3, 2007 8:04:24 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: lol Apr 3, 2007 8:04:50 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: so again....white males being white males Apr 3, 2007 8:05:12 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: its hard to convince the whole bible belt over there along with plenty of other people that gay marriage should be allowed tho Apr 3, 2007 8:05:24 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: lol!!! Apr 3, 2007 8:05:24 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: white gay males are still white males... Apr 3, 2007 8:05:31 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: true Apr 3, 2007 8:05:40 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: but they are deff not the same Apr 3, 2007 8:05:50 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: b/c they are gay Apr 3, 2007 8:05:54 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: they are the same tho Apr 3, 2007 8:06:01 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: thats the problem Apr 3, 2007 8:06:07 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: no, i mean Apr 3, 2007 8:06:11 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: maybe if they called it a union and gave it the smae rights as marriage then we would be able to mov eon Apr 3, 2007 8:06:14 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: move on* Apr 3, 2007 8:06:20 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: thatss still discrimination Apr 3, 2007 8:06:23 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: yea seriously Apr 3, 2007 8:06:38 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: like they are more open minded, and the other white males have just not opened up to the idea.... Apr 3, 2007 8:06:39 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: if its not equal, then its discrimination Apr 3, 2007 8:06:47 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: I agree with sun beauty!!!!! Apr 3, 2007 8:06:57 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: b/c i mean Apr 3, 2007 8:07:15 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: just b/c the name is diff Apr 3, 2007 8:07:20 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: does not make the union diff Apr 3, 2007 8:07:25 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: so what if i said you couldnt get married Apr 3, 2007 8:07:27 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: do u think gay people want their marriage to be looked at as diff than a straight marriage? Apr 3, 2007 8:07:38 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: would that be fair Apr 3, 2007 8:07:38 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: if you had to have a "civil union" how would you feel Apr 3, 2007 8:08:00 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well, look at this way, Apr 3, 2007 8:08:02 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: when a man becomes a man in the jewish tradition Apr 3, 2007 8:08:14 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: it is not called confirmation Apr 3, 2007 8:08:22 PM EDT

CMC frankie27: lol Apr 3, 2007 8:08:58 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: it is Apr 3, 2007 8:09:05 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: so like the separation of religions, so should gays be separated? Apr 3, 2007 8:09:06 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: that makes no sense Apr 3, 2007 8:09:13 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: yea Apr 3, 2007 8:09:21 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: lol Apr 3, 2007 8:09:24 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: thats kinda hard Apr 3, 2007 8:09:27 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: ok, so what i am trying to say is that the names are diff but the idea is the same, and it is all universally accepted Apr 3, 2007 8:09:44 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: that would never be universally accepted Apr 3, 2007 8:10:00 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: why not? Apr 3, 2007 8:10:07 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: but marriage is different than a civil union Apr 3, 2007 8:10:12 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: human nature Apr 3, 2007 8:10:14 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i kno Apr 3, 2007 8:10:24 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: so call it someting then a civil union, and a marraige Apr 3, 2007 8:10:37 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: if they gave a civil union the same rights as a marriage and jus changed the name Apr 3, 2007 8:10:45 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: y not just call it marriage? Apr 3, 2007 8:11:04 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: im just saying to settle this whole issue and move on to something more important Apr 3, 2007 8:11:27 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: compromise? Apr 3, 2007 8:11:32 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: what do we have to move on to? Apr 3, 2007 8:11:39 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: it would be easier than anything to just let gays get married exactly the same Apr 3, 2007 8:11:47 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: no writing up any new rules or regulations Apr 3, 2007 8:11:56 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: oh i kno Apr 3, 2007 8:11:58 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: just ignore the fact that people are gay or straight Apr 3, 2007 8:12:08 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: b/c obv some people are not going to let that happen, in calling it a marragie, b/c of thier religious views....so if it has a diff name they would be more likelly to accpet ti Apr 3, 2007 8:12:10 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: im a big compromise person Apr 3, 2007 8:12:14 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: it would probably be easier just to stop treating gays a second class citizens, but hey, thats just my opinion Apr 3, 2007 8:12:26 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: religious views should not conflict with govt policy tho Apr 3, 2007 8:12:28 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: yeah!!! seperation of church and state!!! Apr 3, 2007 8:12:50 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: it shouldnt but they do Apr 3, 2007 8:12:52 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: but thats not right Apr 3, 2007 8:13:02 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and then if u look at it....they are also seperate Apr 3, 2007 8:13:10 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: a marraig is what the church calles it Apr 3, 2007 8:13:19 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: a civil union is what the govt calls it Apr 3, 2007 8:13:28 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: two names....but same thing Apr 3, 2007 8:13:43 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: people do not have to get married in a church Apr 3, 2007 8:13:44 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: and isnt marriage in the constitution or something? Apr 3, 2007 8:13:47 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: heres a quesiton Apr 3, 2007 8:14:07 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: i cant wait, i dont know about u guys Apr 3, 2007 8:15:08 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: why is getting married in las vegas by a preacher dressed like elvis when your completely trashed to a woman you just met called a marriage, but two gay men who love each other and are committed to each other, have to have a second class degree of "civil union" Apr 3, 2007 8:15:08 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: exactly!!!!! people dont have to get married in a church...so if people called it something different, then it is more likely to be acepted, also...some churchas are going to say no, b/c they dont view it as a marraige....but if the name is diff perhaps they will allow a religious ceremony if that is what teh couple wishes Apr 3, 2007 8:15:13 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: livingdeadbeat!!!! Apr 3, 2007 8:15:46 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: yea thats a whole other point Apr 3, 2007 8:15:48 PM EDT

CMC sun_beauty: i totally agree!!! Apr 3, 2007 8:15:58 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: just like how 50 pct of marriages end in divorce Apr 3, 2007 8:16:06 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: thats so sad Apr 3, 2007 8:16:16 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: where is the sanctity of marriage that anti-gay marriage people always talk about Apr 3, 2007 8:16:24 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: gay people ruining the sacredness of marriage? forget that, straight people already ruined it stop complaining Apr 3, 2007 8:16:32 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: who said they runin the sacredness of marriage? Apr 3, 2007 8:17:00 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: b/c if u think that is what i said...i diff did not Apr 3, 2007 8:17:12 PM EDT

CMC livingdeadbeat87: so gays Apr 3, 2007 8:33:21 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (thanks spacestare) Apr 3, 2007 8:33:22 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: haha ur welcom Apr 3, 2007 8:33:49 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: i was wondering something about gay marriage the other day Apr 3, 2007 8:33:50 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: do tell Apr 3, 2007 8:33:55 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: since it is legal in some states, like Mass Apr 3, 2007 8:34:10 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: can gays who dont live in those states get married there? Apr 3, 2007 8:34:45 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: legally? Apr 3, 2007 8:34:48 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yes i think so Apr 3, 2007 8:34:54 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: but i dont know if it is honored when they go back home Apr 3, 2007 8:35:03 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i could be wrong Apr 3, 2007 8:35:12 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: yea thats what i was wondering Apr 3, 2007 8:35:13 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i think they are still legally married, but they cant recieve any benefits from their state Apr 3, 2007 8:35:28 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: oh. yeah that sounds rightr Apr 3, 2007 8:35:41 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: if that is the case, then it seems like it is all about money after all Apr 3, 2007 8:36:03 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: haha Apr 3, 2007 8:36:14 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well in a way it is Apr 3, 2007 8:36:17 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: because if a gay couple from MD can get married in mass Apr 3, 2007 8:36:21 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: b/c when ur married u get the benifits Apr 3, 2007 8:36:33 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: but the citizen shouldnt have to go to another state to get married Apr 3, 2007 8:36:33 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: then still be considered married in MD Apr 3, 2007 8:36:34 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: they shouldnt, thats the problem Apr 3, 2007 8:36:42 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: its just that they wont receive monetary benefits from theyre home state Apr 3, 2007 8:36:58 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: which must really be what anti-gay marriage people are concerned about Apr 3, 2007 8:37:19 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i think though that gay people would rather be legally married without benefits than nothing at all Apr 3, 2007 8:37:44 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: probably Apr 3, 2007 8:37:51 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah i agree Apr 3, 2007 8:37:54 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: maybe Apr 3, 2007 8:37:59 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: maybe? Apr 3, 2007 8:38:11 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: but that is why it isnt legal in every state Apr 3, 2007 8:38:12 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: and plus you can still fill out forms to recieve all the benefits of a marriage Apr 3, 2007 8:38:32 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: sunbeauty are you planning on marrying a rich guy? Apr 3, 2007 8:38:39 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: lol Apr 3, 2007 8:38:44 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: naw Apr 3, 2007 8:38:47 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: like i know if/when i get married...i would still rather be married and not have the benifits then have the benifits Apr 3, 2007 8:38:50 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: nt at all Apr 3, 2007 8:38:52 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: im just thinkin about the problems that would come with that Apr 3, 2007 8:39:13 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: like i read this story Apr 3, 2007 8:39:25 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: its good to think on all sides Apr 3, 2007 8:39:26 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: but if straight married couple receive benefits, then gay should too Apr 3, 2007 8:40:21 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i would like hear about this story... Apr 3, 2007 8:40:27 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: basically lesbian couple has legal troubles becuz they arent married and the father wants to take over all of his daughters assessts and her partner has no say Apr 3, 2007 8:40:27 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: oh and one of the girls got into an accident where she cant speak Apr 3, 2007 8:40:45 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: aww Apr 3, 2007 8:41:18 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: therefore her father doesnt like the idea of her being in a homosexual relationship so he cuts her partner ff Apr 3, 2007 8:41:19 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: thtst so sad Apr 3, 2007 8:41:20 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: off* Apr 3, 2007 8:41:24 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: thats horrid Apr 3, 2007 8:41:34 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: but thats not govt related either Apr 3, 2007 8:41:35 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: well it is Apr 3, 2007 8:41:46 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: and he can do that becuz technically he is still her guardian Apr 3, 2007 8:41:46 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: oh but it is Apr 3, 2007 8:41:55 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: just personal decisions made by bad fathers Apr 3, 2007 8:41:56 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: the govt allowed for the father to do that Apr 3, 2007 8:42:10 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: as they should Apr 3, 2007 8:42:17 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: if they would have had the ability to be legally entitled to marriage, then the partner would have first say Apr 3, 2007 8:42:19 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: they totally overlooked the fact that they were partners Apr 3, 2007 8:42:28 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah Apr 3, 2007 8:42:32 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: exactlly Apr 3, 2007 8:42:37 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: well how old were the girls? Apr 3, 2007 8:42:38 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: what if his daughter was straight and he just didnt like her husband Apr 3, 2007 8:42:39 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: aww, thats so sad Apr 3, 2007 8:42:39 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: the father Apr 3, 2007 8:42:53 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: like in their upper 30s Apr 3, 2007 8:42:54 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: see there we go Apr 3, 2007 8:43:20 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: tech, he is not her guardian then....b/c she is over 21 right? or is he still her gardian? Apr 3, 2007 8:43:40 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: apparently he has legal claim to her assets though... Apr 3, 2007 8:44:06 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: either way, the courst/part of the govt, allowed it to happen Apr 3, 2007 8:44:10 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: exactly Apr 3, 2007 8:44:17 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: theres alot more to the story but thats the basics Apr 3, 2007 8:44:26 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: it seems like important details were left out, but thats okay... Apr 3, 2007 8:44:41 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: yea there are alot of statics and court cases Apr 3, 2007 8:44:59 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: no words, just emotion... Apr 3, 2007 8:45:02 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: so wait...what was the eventual outcome....the father got the custody? Apr 3, 2007 8:45:26 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: like is it still going on, or is that the outcome Apr 3, 2007 8:45:50 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: no... the judge finally realized that they were better off together so they waited three years to be reunited becuz of her father's decision\ Apr 3, 2007 8:46:17 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: okay this story is making less and less sense lets move on Apr 3, 2007 8:46:41 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: lol Apr 3, 2007 8:46:46 PM EDT
