Nicole Becker: okay, your first topic is privacy rights Mar 18, 2007 6:25:15 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: ... Mar 18, 2007 6:26:28 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: ... the NSA has a database of million of calls made by US citizens. The new survey (released this week) found that 63 percent of Americans said they found the NSA program to be an acceptable way to investigate terrorism, including 44 percent who strongly endorsed the effort. Another 35 percent said the program was unacceptable, which included 24percent who stronly objected to it Mar 18, 2007 6:27:01 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: thoughts? reactions? Mar 18, 2007 6:27:10 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: do you know what the difference between "unacceptable" and "strongly objected" is? Mar 18, 2007 6:27:53 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: like, which is worse Mar 18, 2007 6:27:58 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: i believe strongly objected Mar 18, 2007 6:28:05 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: k Mar 18, 2007 6:28:09 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: As far as privacy rights go I don't think there is anything wrong with the NSA program.. if you have nothing to hide, whats the problem? Mar 18, 2007 6:29:15 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: I don't believe that the phone calls coming from common homes of Americans is how the United States is going to find terrorists. Mar 18, 2007 6:29:44 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: you don't mind if your phone calls are recorded somewhere without your knowledge? Mar 18, 2007 6:29:45 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (that was to xyz) Mar 18, 2007 6:30:03 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: big brother is always watching Mar 18, 2007 6:30:22 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: I just don't understand why they need our phone calls Mar 18, 2007 6:30:45 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: well if we know this program is happening cant we assume that all conversations can be recorded Mar 18, 2007 6:30:49 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: exactly Mar 18, 2007 6:30:58 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: i dont think they need the conversations that most people make, but if this program catches even one terrorist isnt it worth ti Mar 18, 2007 6:31:17 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: it Mar 18, 2007 6:31:19 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: i dont really see a reason for our everyday calls to be recorded, it seems like something a dictatorship would install Mar 18, 2007 6:31:32 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well, i agree with xyz, but i really don't see why the government would even care about 99% of the phone calls made Mar 18, 2007 6:32:05 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: they wont Mar 18, 2007 6:32:11 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i don't think the NSA will mark down in their files that billy broke up with sally or whatever Mar 18, 2007 6:32:29 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: but for every 99 phone calls from college students to their mothers there could be one that means something Mar 18, 2007 6:32:36 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: some agency is probably recording this right now Mar 18, 2007 6:32:55 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: okay well how do you guys feel about the fact that your school can use your facebook pictures against you? Mar 18, 2007 6:33:16 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: thats stupid Mar 18, 2007 6:33:38 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: loyola isn't the NSA Mar 18, 2007 6:33:43 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: for what purpose? Mar 18, 2007 6:33:50 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: i mean we would be naive to think that anything we put out into technology cant be tracked Mar 18, 2007 6:33:50 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: thats the best point Mar 18, 2007 6:33:58 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea using facebook against us is just stupid Mar 18, 2007 6:34:08 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: its stupid, becuase loyola shouldn't care, but knowing that they can use it against us should be enough warning to avoid putting something incriminating up Mar 18, 2007 6:34:38 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: even a beer can in the corner of a picture can get an athlete suspended theoretically Mar 18, 2007 6:35:37 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: the only thing Loyola should care about is how we perform acedemically as far as i'm concerned Mar 18, 2007 6:35:56 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: ehh.... thats taking it a little too far Mar 18, 2007 6:36:13 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: i mean i dont think loyola should go looking for it Mar 18, 2007 6:36:27 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: fair enough Mar 18, 2007 6:36:27 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i mean, last night some kid got rocked in the dome with a beer bottle at a bar Mar 18, 2007 6:36:30 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: that's what i meant Mar 18, 2007 6:36:33 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: hopefully theyll use facebook to catch the kid Mar 18, 2007 6:36:45 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: but what if they find pictures of 15 other kids in the process Mar 18, 2007 6:36:59 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: should they be held accountable Mar 18, 2007 6:37:08 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: no Mar 18, 2007 6:37:12 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: but they would be Mar 18, 2007 6:37:18 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: loyola should only care about the offender Mar 18, 2007 6:37:20 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well don't be tagged Mar 18, 2007 6:37:33 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yeah but they cant pretend they dont see the other people in the pictures Mar 18, 2007 6:37:36 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: "it wasn't me" Mar 18, 2007 6:37:38 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: "i have a twin" Mar 18, 2007 6:37:45 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: haha Mar 18, 2007 6:37:46 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: lol Mar 18, 2007 6:37:47 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: and the problem with facebook is that there isnt much censorship.. so theoretically loyola can punish us if they see it Mar 18, 2007 6:38:36 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: if your underage Mar 18, 2007 6:39:15 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: which at least half of loyola students are Mar 18, 2007 6:39:28 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: and if your smoking pot in the picture your just an idiot Mar 18, 2007 6:39:38 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: more Mar 18, 2007 6:39:40 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: hahahaha Mar 18, 2007 6:39:42 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: yes Mar 18, 2007 6:39:43 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: but as for privacy, we dont have as much as we think Mar 18, 2007 6:40:21 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: every text message you send can be tracked, every im can be recovered. sure most conversations arent worth it, but what about the text messages in the recent case with the 30 something year old teacher who was sending inapropriate texts and pictures to a like 15 year old boy... anything can be found Mar 18, 2007 6:40:21 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: heh Mar 18, 2007 6:40:49 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: like i said Mar 18, 2007 6:40:57 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: big brother is always watching Mar 18, 2007 6:41:02 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: like you think you have privacy, you dont Mar 18, 2007 6:41:05 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: but they don't care about a lot Mar 18, 2007 6:41:09 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea but we dont have soldiers with AK's walking down our streets plucking us from our homes for suspicious activity Mar 18, 2007 6:41:25 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: is this a problem? that we don't really have as much privacy as we think? Mar 18, 2007 6:41:26 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: we have plenty of freedom Mar 18, 2007 6:41:37 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: the NSA doesn't care about some idiot who puts a picture of himself getting stoned on the interent Mar 18, 2007 6:41:40 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: exactly Mar 18, 2007 6:41:42 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: exactly. but so like these calls to catch terrorists. i dont mind, my conversations arent about terrorism acts. if they can catch someone through it then go for it Mar 18, 2007 6:41:47 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: if that was the case Mar 18, 2007 6:41:47 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: yea Mar 18, 2007 6:41:55 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: if you have nothing to hide, whats the matter? Mar 18, 2007 6:42:07 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: eh Mar 18, 2007 6:42:12 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: thats not quite a solid argument Mar 18, 2007 6:42:18 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: it's a privacy Mar 18, 2007 6:42:22 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i bet theres some stuff you want to keep "private" that you have online Mar 18, 2007 6:42:31 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: a message to an ex-boyfriend/girlfriend Mar 18, 2007 6:42:46 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: something, you know? not neccessarily anything illegal Mar 18, 2007 6:42:57 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: everyone has something to hide Mar 18, 2007 6:43:17 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yes, but like we said, i dont think the NSA cares what we talk about in everyday conversation Mar 18, 2007 6:43:31 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: thats not what you said though Mar 18, 2007 6:44:01 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: the fact is that if you wanted something to be public you would say, show, or do it in front of everyone, but you don't. And that's for a reason. Mar 18, 2007 6:44:04 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: you said "if you have nothing to hide, whats the matter?" Mar 18, 2007 6:44:18 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: ok good point Mar 18, 2007 6:44:26 PM EDT

CMC xyz456: so would we be against the NSA thing Mar 18, 2007 6:45:47 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: yes Mar 18, 2007 6:45:54 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: best example of privacy invasion Mar 18, 2007 6:45:57 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (i mean yes, answer that question, haha) Mar 18, 2007 6:46:11 PM EDT

CMC bjbsh23: thank you Mar 18, 2007 6:52:04 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: its a show on MSNBC Mar 18, 2007 6:52:12 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: a girl pretends to be an underage girl in chat rooms Mar 18, 2007 6:52:26 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: and the cops record her messages Mar 18, 2007 6:52:35 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: they lure sexual predators to meet in real life Mar 18, 2007 6:52:51 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: troy is this an interest of yours? Mar 18, 2007 6:53:07 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: then chris hanson does his badass "you're on a tv show" and questions them then they arrest him Mar 18, 2007 6:53:17 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: its hilarious Mar 18, 2007 6:53:22 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i love watching the pervs get sent to jail Mar 18, 2007 6:53:30 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: haha that show sounds hilarious Mar 18, 2007 6:53:34 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: so, is it alright that someone's privacy is being invaded to avoid something terrible happening? Mar 18, 2007 6:53:45 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yes Mar 18, 2007 6:53:50 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: exactly Mar 18, 2007 6:53:55 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: ok so the show infringes on the rights of the pervs and they get caught? Mar 18, 2007 6:54:00 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: myspace isnt safe anything you put online can be tracked Mar 18, 2007 6:54:05 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: yes Mar 18, 2007 6:54:09 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: they actually just use AIM Mar 18, 2007 6:54:19 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: chat rooms Mar 18, 2007 6:54:27 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: oh i was reading the myspace profile haha Mar 18, 2007 6:54:28 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: oh maybe they use that too Mar 18, 2007 6:54:37 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: who knows Mar 18, 2007 6:54:39 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: facebook also keeps everything you post too Mar 18, 2007 6:55:28 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: but where do they draw the line between whose privacy to invade-- if they have to invade the privacy of innocent people to get to the guilty, is this fair? Mar 18, 2007 6:55:31 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yes to help other innocent people Mar 18, 2007 6:56:14 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: if youre smart about going online, youre not going to get tagged Mar 18, 2007 6:56:26 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: exactly Mar 18, 2007 6:57:05 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: and if the people who are tagged are caught then thats good Mar 18, 2007 6:57:18 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well people are tagged for random reasons Mar 18, 2007 6:57:44 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: well if people are searching to find rapists on myspace then they aren't going to take every beer ridden photo and get those people in trouble too Mar 18, 2007 6:58:20 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: they don't have time to get everyone in trouble, at least I think Mar 18, 2007 6:58:50 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: i meant like if terrorists or child molestors are caught then good Mar 18, 2007 6:58:58 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: What about a future employer looking through your facebook pictures to help decide whether or not to fire you, as some employers are now doing? Mar 18, 2007 6:59:06 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: i just really dont think this is as major of a topic as it sounds, our lives do not really get affected by it , i dont wake up and think about how to codify my conversations online Mar 18, 2007 6:59:19 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (or other pictures online) Mar 18, 2007 6:59:20 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: your social life doesnt have anything to do with your 9-5 weekday job Mar 18, 2007 6:59:39 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: sure it does Mar 18, 2007 7:00:14 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: haha i mean common Mar 18, 2007 7:00:17 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: you represent your company, employer, whatever, everytime you are our in public as an adult Mar 18, 2007 7:00:44 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: that is an excellent point Mar 18, 2007 7:00:59 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: but its not like your employer is expecting you to be sally do-gooder Mar 18, 2007 7:01:35 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: theyre expecting you let loose every now and again Mar 18, 2007 7:01:47 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i think once you are an adult, it's time to either delete or tone down your facebook or myspace profiles Mar 18, 2007 7:01:53 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: but don't you think they could get the wrong impression from one or two pictures? Mar 18, 2007 7:01:57 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: good point bjbsh Mar 18, 2007 7:02:06 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: but those pictures can still be found online Mar 18, 2007 7:02:10 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: if its one or two pictures, they shouldnt care Mar 18, 2007 7:02:23 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well, not unless its you snorting coke off a dead prostitute giving a thumbs up Mar 18, 2007 7:02:43 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: through extensive searches? Mar 18, 2007 7:02:44 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: but look at everyone's facebook pictures.. they are of when you go out... very rarely are their pictures of you studying at your desk Mar 18, 2007 7:02:56 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: lmao Mar 18, 2007 7:03:04 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: so my point was not that social life has nothing to do with your job, even though i said that, what i meant was facebook can be decieving Mar 18, 2007 7:04:24 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i think jobs should provide a criteria of what they feel if appropriate for online display for the public and if not followed then they have reason for not hiring /firing Mar 18, 2007 7:05:29 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: sure Mar 18, 2007 7:06:39 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: if it has becme so important to companies Mar 18, 2007 7:07:01 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: but you can't take off what's already there, so would having a criteria really help? Mar 18, 2007 7:07:37 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i don't understand that Mar 18, 2007 7:08:03 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: do they have to search extensively Mar 18, 2007 7:08:13 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: ? Mar 18, 2007 7:08:23 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: to find information you have deleted Mar 18, 2007 7:08:24 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: i'm not sure how extensive the search would be Mar 18, 2007 7:08:28 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: companies i mean Mar 18, 2007 7:08:33 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: pretty much Mar 18, 2007 7:08:33 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: but they could hire private detectives Mar 18, 2007 7:08:48 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: lets assume that like anything you ever post can be found... then it wouldnt matter if they said now take off the pictures of you drinking.. Mar 18, 2007 7:08:56 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i mean if they have to search extremely hard to find incriminating things, then it shouldn't affect you gewttign a job at their company Mar 18, 2007 7:09:34 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: that's absurd Mar 18, 2007 7:09:38 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: another good point Mar 18, 2007 7:09:50 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: like how much do these companies really care Mar 18, 2007 7:10:01 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea so is this topic crushed yet Mar 18, 2007 7:10:05 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: yeah I think we can move on now Mar 18, 2007 7:10:40 PM EDT
