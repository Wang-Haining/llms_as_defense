Nicole Becker: Okay our first topic is marijuana Apr 15, 2007 6:15:30 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: okay Apr 15, 2007 6:16:02 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: what about it Apr 15, 2007 6:16:22 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: Twelve states allow the medicinal sale of marijuana. Oversight is lax and there are few specific guidelines for buyers and sellers of a drug still illegal under federal law. In CA some clinic owners are making big bucks and the DEA is cracking down and raiding some clinics Apr 15, 2007 6:16:37 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (that's your little story/discussion starter... it confused some groups so I don't know how helpful it will be.) Apr 15, 2007 6:16:56 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: ok Apr 15, 2007 6:17:10 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: so are we supposed to discuss how we feel about the legalization? Apr 15, 2007 6:17:47 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: yeah Apr 15, 2007 6:18:02 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: ok Apr 15, 2007 6:18:07 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: or how you feel about it being used medicinally, any feelings on it Apr 15, 2007 6:18:13 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: if its going to be used like any other drug to cure an illness then i am in favor of its medical use Apr 15, 2007 6:18:57 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: i agree, but then it needs to be better observed Apr 15, 2007 6:19:16 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: it seems like the states & feds need to get on the same page as far as legalization Apr 15, 2007 6:19:25 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i agree Apr 15, 2007 6:19:34 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea it should be a federal matter Apr 15, 2007 6:19:49 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: all or none Apr 15, 2007 6:19:51 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: there can't be such a varying idea on the matter Apr 15, 2007 6:19:52 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: hm Apr 15, 2007 6:19:53 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i don't know about that hoops Apr 15, 2007 6:19:59 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: why should it be all or nothing Apr 15, 2007 6:20:18 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: i think if it is a proven medical situation it should either be used or not used Apr 15, 2007 6:20:29 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: that's not the only issue though Apr 15, 2007 6:21:03 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: if its effectively helping people i none state it should be helpign the poeple in all states Apr 15, 2007 6:21:05 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: its being "used" regardless of the legality, just to get high Apr 15, 2007 6:21:18 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: they need to have better oversight of who they are selling it to Apr 15, 2007 6:21:35 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: haha yea i mean i am for that Apr 15, 2007 6:21:37 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea i agree Apr 15, 2007 6:21:43 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: mm Apr 15, 2007 6:21:55 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i mean, i'd be all for general legalization, but i don't know if thats off-topic Apr 15, 2007 6:22:20 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: the discussion starter said that there were few guidelines for buyers and sellers, they should be stricter about it if its not legal Apr 15, 2007 6:22:26 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: but it won't change use of it if they legalize it, obviously people will still find a way to get it Apr 15, 2007 6:22:47 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: exactly Apr 15, 2007 6:22:56 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: it be even easier with the clinics too Apr 15, 2007 6:23:19 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea pot is just to prevalent in our society (college) to not be a used commodity Apr 15, 2007 6:23:21 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: ? Apr 15, 2007 6:23:35 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i don't understand how alcohol can be legal and not marijuana Apr 15, 2007 6:24:41 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: more people smoke then one would assume, from all walks of life from professors to doctors to us, so as long as its out there people will buy it Apr 15, 2007 6:24:53 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: mm Apr 15, 2007 6:25:50 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: legally or not, people will get their hands on it Apr 15, 2007 6:25:51 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i think we Apr 15, 2007 6:25:57 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: 'd all agree on that Apr 15, 2007 6:26:02 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: sure Apr 15, 2007 6:26:07 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yeah Apr 15, 2007 6:26:08 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: so why not legalize it for people who are dying and in need of it? Apr 15, 2007 6:26:33 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well i don't think they neccessarily need it, but itd be nice if they could use it Apr 15, 2007 6:27:19 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: right Apr 15, 2007 6:27:46 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: the economic remifications would be nuts, plus it is a gateway drug, which sounds lame but its true Apr 15, 2007 6:28:07 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: cigarettes are a gateway drug Apr 15, 2007 6:28:26 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: alcohol is a gateway drug Apr 15, 2007 6:28:36 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: like we sait its still going to be used no matter if its legal or not Apr 15, 2007 6:28:42 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i mean it can't be ass legal as alcohol for example Apr 15, 2007 6:28:46 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: any drug is a "gateway" to something else Apr 15, 2007 6:28:46 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: why not Apr 15, 2007 6:28:55 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i think it should be legalized for meical use Apr 15, 2007 6:29:28 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: i agreee Apr 15, 2007 6:29:36 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: not so that everyone can feel free to get high everyday Apr 15, 2007 6:29:42 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: exactly Apr 15, 2007 6:29:48 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: but not in the same way as alcohol or cigarettes, it really makes you aware of entire sub culture of drugs that arent necessarily out in the open like booze Apr 15, 2007 6:30:00 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: ok, maybe Apr 15, 2007 6:30:54 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: but whats really wrong with getting high as opposed to getting drunk Apr 15, 2007 6:31:07 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: (im just playing devil's advocate) Apr 15, 2007 6:31:17 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: oh i wont disagree with that Apr 15, 2007 6:31:22 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: me to Apr 15, 2007 6:31:40 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: o Apr 15, 2007 6:31:53 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: how we doing on length, nicole Apr 15, 2007 6:33:19 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: about halfway i think Apr 15, 2007 6:33:49 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: (it's hard to tell you exactly) Apr 15, 2007 6:33:56 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: k Apr 15, 2007 6:34:25 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: how do you guys feel about marijuana being used recreationally or being legalized for recreational purposes? Apr 15, 2007 6:34:27 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: im for it Apr 15, 2007 6:34:40 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i don't see how that would do too much damage Apr 15, 2007 6:34:51 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yeah Apr 15, 2007 6:35:05 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: considering that a large amount of people are already doing it Apr 15, 2007 6:35:13 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: it wouldnt change much Apr 15, 2007 6:35:22 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: i agree, those who would use are doing it already Apr 15, 2007 6:35:41 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea i really dont think it would change much either Apr 15, 2007 6:35:49 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i think a lotttt of people would start smoking Apr 15, 2007 6:35:59 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: who are just worried about breaking the law Apr 15, 2007 6:36:12 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: that otherwise would be smokers Apr 15, 2007 6:36:21 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: haha thats true and in the grand scheme of things it does make you dumber Apr 15, 2007 6:36:22 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: but what about the excessive amount of alcohol use Apr 15, 2007 6:36:29 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: whats the difference Apr 15, 2007 6:36:34 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: haha well if your already doing one i dont think your brain needs both Apr 15, 2007 6:36:55 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: you would have a whole new breed of burnout drunks Apr 15, 2007 6:37:11 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: it would be much like a third of loyola Apr 15, 2007 6:37:24 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: hahaha Apr 15, 2007 6:37:49 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: any college really, probably even adults Apr 15, 2007 6:38:55 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea probably Apr 15, 2007 6:39:28 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: but how many people would really start up because it was legal? think about the large percentage of kids who drink even though they are underage and that is illegal Apr 15, 2007 6:39:38 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: i mean certain professions lend themselves to certain lifestyles Apr 15, 2007 6:40:01 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: thats probably the best point made so far, hoops Apr 15, 2007 6:40:22 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea kids do like to drink Apr 15, 2007 6:40:34 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: haha Apr 15, 2007 6:41:21 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: do you think lots of pro athletes smoke pot Apr 15, 2007 6:42:41 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i wouldn't think so Apr 15, 2007 6:43:05 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: can they and pass tests? Apr 15, 2007 6:43:07 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: maybe Apr 15, 2007 6:43:08 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: who knows Apr 15, 2007 6:43:15 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: drug i mean Apr 15, 2007 6:43:16 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yeah arent they drug tested Apr 15, 2007 6:43:25 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: haha i know Apr 15, 2007 6:43:26 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: lol Apr 15, 2007 6:43:28 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: yea but look at baseball, all those dudes mask their pee Apr 15, 2007 6:43:40 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea i mean passing tests isnt to tough, but offseason would be the time to smoke if you are them Apr 15, 2007 6:43:45 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: how would thinks like that be affected by legalization (recreationally) if it were to occur? Apr 15, 2007 6:43:56 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: things* Apr 15, 2007 6:44:00 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: honestly im not sure how legalization would change anything Apr 15, 2007 6:44:42 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: if kids saw pro athletes smoking pot that could increase a younger crowd Apr 15, 2007 6:45:02 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: itd be a hell of a lot safer to buy, thats for sure Apr 15, 2007 6:45:10 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: there wouldn't be as many people in jail Apr 15, 2007 6:45:24 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: i mean, it might get completely out of control nationwide, or it might become not so cool for people who smoke and it may die down a lot Apr 15, 2007 6:45:24 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: no one will ever know Apr 15, 2007 6:45:41 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: the government doesn't know either Apr 15, 2007 6:45:45 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea it would be interesting Apr 15, 2007 6:45:53 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: that's why they're afraid to change anything Apr 15, 2007 6:46:00 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i don't think we're heading in that direction anytime soon Apr 15, 2007 6:46:02 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: agreed Apr 15, 2007 6:46:57 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea Apr 15, 2007 6:47:03 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: that's for sure Apr 15, 2007 6:48:45 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: alright! Apr 15, 2007 6:50:04 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: is that a rap? Apr 15, 2007 6:50:09 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: i don't think there's enough text yet Apr 15, 2007 6:50:20 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: hmm Apr 15, 2007 6:50:29 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: what kind of restrictions do you think would have to be put into place if it were legalized? Apr 15, 2007 6:50:55 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: amount one can carry Apr 15, 2007 6:51:05 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: out of ones residence Apr 15, 2007 6:51:14 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yeah Apr 15, 2007 6:51:19 PM EDT

CMC hoopdreams13: 18 Apr 15, 2007 6:51:36 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: heh Apr 15, 2007 6:51:37 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: 21 Apr 15, 2007 6:51:41 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: what about being high in public? Apr 15, 2007 6:51:46 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: same as alchohol Apr 15, 2007 6:51:49 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: how do you think this would affect jobs/work environment Apr 15, 2007 6:51:59 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: i dont know about that Apr 15, 2007 6:52:04 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: well dont be drunk at work so dont be high at work? Apr 15, 2007 6:52:14 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well you'd be in troublee if youre drunk at work Apr 15, 2007 6:52:17 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: being high in public is a much more peaceful thing then being drunk in public Apr 15, 2007 6:52:35 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: no i dont mean at work Apr 15, 2007 6:52:39 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: i mean like to go out and eat Apr 15, 2007 6:52:49 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: do you think this could plausibly be controlled? (being high at work or being high in public?) Apr 15, 2007 6:53:23 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: its harder to tell if someone is high then drunk Apr 15, 2007 6:53:23 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: agreed Apr 15, 2007 6:53:32 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: agreed as well Apr 15, 2007 6:53:43 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: most companies are happy as long as their emloyees perform Apr 15, 2007 6:55:12 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: so i guess unless you were doing something that got you in trouble in the first place and then were drug tested you wouldnt necessarily be caught Apr 15, 2007 6:55:32 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: i would say that and represent the company postively Apr 15, 2007 6:55:41 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: yea Apr 15, 2007 6:55:49 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: right Apr 15, 2007 6:55:52 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea its all about the image of the pot head that hurts pot Apr 15, 2007 6:56:06 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yeah Apr 15, 2007 6:56:12 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: what about government jobs and getting clearance and things like that? Apr 15, 2007 6:56:14 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: huh? Apr 15, 2007 6:56:25 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: well its not breaking the law (in our example) Apr 15, 2007 6:56:32 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: as of right now, depending on the clearance you cannot have smoked pot within a certain number of years Apr 15, 2007 6:56:50 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: mm Apr 15, 2007 6:57:03 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: but if it was legal then you just cant be high at work?/ Apr 15, 2007 6:57:09 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: if it becomes legal it opens up the door for many new places to be high Apr 15, 2007 6:57:39 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: yeah definitly Apr 15, 2007 6:58:19 PM EDT
CMC troy2112: haha good piont Apr 15, 2007 6:58:24 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: yeah but people gop drunk to work and don't get caught Apr 15, 2007 6:59:28 PM EDT
CMC xyz456: so its the same. you can go to work high at the risk of getting caught Apr 15, 2007 7:00:07 PM EDT
CMC hoopdreams13: yea if they are both legal then they are one in the same at work Apr 15, 2007 7:00:38 PM EDT
CMC bjbsh23: right Apr 15, 2007 7:02:01 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: alright Apr 15, 2007 7:03:37 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: well it looks like you guys are done with that topic Apr 15, 2007 7:03:45 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: so lets move on Apr 15, 2007 7:03:47 PM EDT
