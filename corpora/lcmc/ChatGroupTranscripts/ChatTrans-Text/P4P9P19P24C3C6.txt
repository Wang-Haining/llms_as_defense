Melissa Carbone: OK your final topic is the catholic church Apr 1, 2007 3:10:04 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: do they need to change their ways to adapt to life in the 21st century? Apr 1, 2007 3:10:19 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I think they need to be more accepting of other groups of people Apr 1, 2007 3:11:10 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I could agree with that, gays in particular Apr 1, 2007 3:11:22 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well when you say that you can't just target the catholic church Apr 1, 2007 3:11:40 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: They still hold the view that if one is not baptized, he or she is not saved Apr 1, 2007 3:11:41 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I think that there are certain things that could be changed, but at the same time I think it's important to have something that remains relatively steadfast in this fast-paced world of the 21st century Apr 1, 2007 3:11:44 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: But the question targets the catholic church Apr 1, 2007 3:12:27 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what groups of people were you talking about mtnbike?/ Apr 1, 2007 3:12:51 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Anyone who isnt Catholic Apr 1, 2007 3:13:04 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: true, but a lot of people and groups aren't accepting of gays Apr 1, 2007 3:13:05 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I could agree that to be a respected institution they have to hold true to the core of their beliefts and values, but some practices and subtleties have to be brought up to date Apr 1, 2007 3:13:10 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: ME Apr 1, 2007 3:13:14 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: exclude the ME Apr 1, 2007 3:13:31 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Not arguing that Apr 1, 2007 3:13:39 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but we are not talking about a lot of groups Apr 1, 2007 3:13:45 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: just the one that thinks God created all of us equally Apr 1, 2007 3:13:52 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: how are they not accepting of non-catholics? Apr 1, 2007 3:14:05 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: By claiming that if you dont get baptized, you dont go to heaven Apr 1, 2007 3:14:35 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: do they shun them? Apr 1, 2007 3:14:39 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: or discriminate against them? Apr 1, 2007 3:14:47 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I think so Apr 1, 2007 3:15:06 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: because they discriminate from those going to heaven and those who do Apr 1, 2007 3:15:14 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but who says their way is right? Apr 1, 2007 3:15:19 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: That is discrimination Apr 1, 2007 3:15:24 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: Muslims say that you have to pray 5 times a day and make a pilgrimmage to Mecca etc. in order to be saved Apr 1, 2007 3:15:28 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: they don't not associate wiht non-catholics though do they? Apr 1, 2007 3:15:32 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: do you have a problem with them as well? Apr 1, 2007 3:15:39 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: or for that matter, all institutionalized religions? Apr 1, 2007 3:15:52 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Yeah, I would say they exclude people by their very nature as well Apr 1, 2007 3:15:58 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Plus, who knows what it takes to get to heaven Apr 1, 2007 3:16:17 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Exactly Apr 1, 2007 3:16:25 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: who says there is a heaven? Apr 1, 2007 3:16:27 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: their very nature excludes people Apr 1, 2007 3:16:31 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: intstitutionalized religion is mere speculation Apr 1, 2007 3:16:32 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Exactly Apr 1, 2007 3:16:34 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: excuse me, knows* Apr 1, 2007 3:16:37 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: besides, if someone tells you that you're not going to heaven, and they don't have any direct power over you, why would you care? Apr 1, 2007 3:17:02 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Right Apr 1, 2007 3:17:19 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: same thing as back in the gender discussion Apr 1, 2007 3:17:24 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: no power, who cares Apr 1, 2007 3:17:26 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: exactly, so what's your problem with the Catholic Church then? Apr 1, 2007 3:17:41 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: It makes claims based on nothing Apr 1, 2007 3:18:02 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: what do you mean based on nothing? Apr 1, 2007 3:18:12 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: No one knows the truth about God or heaven Apr 1, 2007 3:18:31 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: If I may, I would like to relay an idea presented by Nietzsche Apr 1, 2007 3:18:34 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: go for it Apr 1, 2007 3:18:41 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Yet they claim to know everything there is to know Apr 1, 2007 3:18:44 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: Actually, doctors of the Church like Thomas Aquinas claim that we can't know anything about God, God is a mystery Apr 1, 2007 3:19:46 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well that's true of every religion, but you can't say they base it on nothing, hey base it on the way they interpret the Bible Apr 1, 2007 3:19:55 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: He claims there is such thing as a slave morality that is very much a part of the Judeo-Christian beginnings where the people were originally enslaved and/or oppressed, and because of their position in oppression they create values that support the "good" man as being humble and of less power just because it oppossed those who have more power over them Apr 1, 2007 3:19:57 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: interesting Apr 1, 2007 3:20:28 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Basically he sums up that Christianity was created out of a need to have a superhero (God) who spoke for the humbler and weaker people Apr 1, 2007 3:20:29 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Knowing how strong the human mind is, it certainly is a provoking thought Apr 1, 2007 3:20:45 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: it seems to me like mtnbike has a problem with the Catholic Church in all centuries Apr 1, 2007 3:20:48 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: not just the 21st, please correct me if I'm wrong Apr 1, 2007 3:21:04 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: it seems to me like he has a problem with all organized religion Apr 1, 2007 3:21:12 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Thats correct Apr 1, 2007 3:21:14 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I do not agree with some of the literal interpretations such as this no meat fridays Apr 1, 2007 3:21:20 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Why do we need an institution to dictate our spiritual lives? Apr 1, 2007 3:21:40 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I think an individual's relationship with God is an individual thing Apr 1, 2007 3:22:20 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: not a communal thing Apr 1, 2007 3:22:27 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: some people find comfort in religion, i don't see whats so wrong with that Apr 1, 2007 3:22:39 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Perhaps we can look to Emerson as another authority who says that we can process our spiritual lives on our own, why have a non-personal institution attempt to do that for us through empty practices Apr 1, 2007 3:22:50 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah but the Bible also says to fellowship with other Christians, church is a way of doing that Apr 1, 2007 3:22:58 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: That supports Nietzsche's claim Janada Apr 1, 2007 3:23:04 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Your prior comment about comfort Apr 1, 2007 3:23:15 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: That religion was a way to comfort the people in the slave morality position Apr 1, 2007 3:23:30 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: But what authority does the Bible have? Apr 1, 2007 3:23:34 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: well then, if we may agree to disgree about the validity of institutionalized religions, and just accept their existence, perhaps we can return to the issue at hand, which is, what about the Catholic Church conflicts with the 21st century, and should the Church change its ways to conform Apr 1, 2007 3:23:35 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well the Bible is God-breathed Apr 1, 2007 3:23:50 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: How do you know that? Apr 1, 2007 3:23:59 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I stated my opinion that they can hold true to their core, but some of the practices are just empty and meaningless Apr 1, 2007 3:24:06 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: such as the meat business on Fridays Apr 1, 2007 3:24:11 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so fasting is at odds with the 21st century? Apr 1, 2007 3:25:08 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i mean i'm not catholic and i don't understand some of their traditions either but at the same time, they are traditions and part of what the church was built on, you can't just take them away just like that Apr 1, 2007 3:25:23 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Not necessarily, just does not seem pertinent to the practice of the religion Apr 1, 2007 3:25:24 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: the big 21st century question is homosexuality Apr 1, 2007 3:25:32 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: The church needs to accept the fact that its ok to be gay Apr 1, 2007 3:25:56 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I agree Apr 1, 2007 3:26:07 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I think if we traced the tradition of meat-eating we would find it was not really created with the beginning of the church Apr 1, 2007 3:26:09 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I mean, look at all the priests who have molested young boys Apr 1, 2007 3:26:12 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I'm not saying thst's ok, but... Apr 1, 2007 3:26:23 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I think that there are members of the Church who do accept gay people Apr 1, 2007 3:26:41 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: sure Apr 1, 2007 3:26:49 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but it is not an accepted view of the church Apr 1, 2007 3:26:55 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: and that's the change the organization as a whole needs to make Apr 1, 2007 3:27:02 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i agree Apr 1, 2007 3:27:08 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I also feel that women should be allowed to participate in the hierarchal administration of the Church Apr 1, 2007 3:27:28 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I think the church is reluctant to change because that would be a sign of weakness Apr 1, 2007 3:27:29 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: agreed to both of you Apr 1, 2007 3:27:42 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Changing their doctrines that they hold so closely Apr 1, 2007 3:27:44 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I mean, especially with the shortage of priests that exists in this country, I think that women should have the opportunity to become priests Apr 1, 2007 3:28:27 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Seems to me like the church is practicing gender discrimination Apr 1, 2007 3:28:31 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: but the change would have to come in europe, not inthe united states Apr 1, 2007 3:28:45 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yes Apr 1, 2007 3:28:54 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: perhaps Apr 1, 2007 3:29:35 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: If I may inquire about another hot topic with the Catholic Church, do you feel that priests should be allowed to marry? Apr 1, 2007 3:29:38 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: What is the church's reason for not allowing women to be priest? Apr 1, 2007 3:29:42 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: that's a good question, I don't know the answer Apr 1, 2007 3:30:05 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well i think it would solve some problems like the lack of priests and the pedophilia but at the same time priests are supposed to be married to the church Apr 1, 2007 3:30:20 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: ah, so you feel that they couldn't adequately peform their duties if they had to take care of a family as well? Apr 1, 2007 3:30:56 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well you can't be married to your spouse and married to the church at the same time Apr 1, 2007 3:31:41 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Why not? Apr 1, 2007 3:31:49 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: families are very time consuming Apr 1, 2007 3:32:22 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: This is what I mean when I say the church creates doctrines out of thin air and call it fact Apr 1, 2007 3:32:29 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: one or the other will end up getting neglected in some way Apr 1, 2007 3:32:38 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: im not saying they call it fact, it's just one of their traditions Apr 1, 2007 3:33:00 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Protestant religions allow priests to marry Apr 1, 2007 3:33:14 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I can agree with that perhaps to some extent, but how can the priest fully enjoy God's gifts without a family Apr 1, 2007 3:33:17 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: and that seems to work Apr 1, 2007 3:33:19 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: not everyone has a family Apr 1, 2007 3:33:35 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i mean, spouse and children Apr 1, 2007 3:33:44 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i know somewhere in the Bible it says that it's better not to be married but if you can't control yourself sexually then you should or something like that Apr 1, 2007 3:34:00 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: you see, the docrine of requiring priests to remain celibate was a product of the 12th century Apr 1, 2007 3:34:40 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: before then, priests were usually married Apr 1, 2007 3:35:08 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but in the 12th century, the Catholic Church became very powerful and gained a lot of land Apr 1, 2007 3:35:26 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: married priests who died left children whose right it was to have the land Apr 1, 2007 3:35:42 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but the Catholic Church wanted to hold on to that land Apr 1, 2007 3:35:53 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: hence, they decided to ban priests from marrying Apr 1, 2007 3:36:09 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Thats interesting Apr 1, 2007 3:36:12 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: makes sense Apr 1, 2007 3:36:15 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: that is interesting Apr 1, 2007 3:36:19 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: seeing as this ban is a product of the greedy, corrupt 12th century Catholic Church Apr 1, 2007 3:36:33 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I wonder if its all that necessary in the 21st century Apr 1, 2007 3:36:42 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah, that really changes things Apr 1, 2007 3:37:06 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I do not think the ban of marrying is necessary Apr 1, 2007 3:37:20 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I mean, people also used the argument you mentioned before Janada, even back then, but money and land were the main factors in the decision Apr 1, 2007 3:37:46 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Like I said before, the church doesnt want to change because it would make them look weak Apr 1, 2007 3:37:53 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: precisely Apr 1, 2007 3:38:04 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but they look much weaker by sticking to their ways Apr 1, 2007 3:38:13 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: It makes no sense not to change Apr 1, 2007 3:38:17 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: If I may add, the Catholic Church has allowed certain men, who were formally reverends in a Protestant faith with a wife and children, to convert to the Catholic faith and become priests Apr 1, 2007 3:39:50 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: really? why is that? Apr 1, 2007 3:40:05 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so, perhaps this is a sign of change to come Apr 1, 2007 3:40:08 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i'm not sure why Apr 1, 2007 3:40:21 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: That does not seem to make any sense Apr 1, 2007 3:40:30 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i can't explain it, but my dad knows one of these priests Apr 1, 2007 3:40:48 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i just thought that I'd throw it out there Apr 1, 2007 3:40:58 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Another example of weakness Apr 1, 2007 3:41:13 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: certainly shows some inconsistency Apr 1, 2007 3:41:21 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: how do you mean? Apr 1, 2007 3:41:26 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i guess they're getting desperate Apr 1, 2007 3:41:27 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Hopefully it would be a sign of change to come Apr 1, 2007 3:41:28 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: oh i see Apr 1, 2007 3:41:29 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Whats the deal with all the priests molesting boys? Apr 1, 2007 3:41:39 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I dont understand how there can be so many Apr 1, 2007 3:41:50 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: well, neither do I Apr 1, 2007 3:42:00 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: how many have there been? Apr 1, 2007 3:42:05 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: it's just a horrible tragedy Apr 1, 2007 3:42:06 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: And those are just the cases we know of Apr 1, 2007 3:42:14 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: unfortunately, one that seems like it could've been somewhat prevented Apr 1, 2007 3:42:24 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: it seems that certain priests and bishops knew about it for some time before it was exposed Apr 1, 2007 3:42:44 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well maybe, but at the same time there are men who are married that molest little boys Apr 1, 2007 3:42:47 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: They are not representing the Catholic Church Apr 1, 2007 3:43:00 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: true, but you cant deny the fact that theres a strong correlation Apr 1, 2007 3:43:07 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: which is why think that the nature of the Church administration needs to change - include women Apr 1, 2007 3:43:09 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: im not saying they are, i was saying in response to its prevention Apr 1, 2007 3:43:23 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: im also not saying there isn't a correlation, but correlation doesn't imply causation Apr 1, 2007 3:44:04 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: indeed, child molestation is very much a part of the 21st century Apr 1, 2007 3:45:15 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: to uh, concur with Janada's earlier statement Apr 1, 2007 3:45:49 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: its just another example of how the church is a contrived oraganization - how can they say that priests are God's mediators when they commit such horrible crimes? Apr 1, 2007 3:46:46 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Agreed Apr 1, 2007 3:47:16 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: They would say that the love of God, or grace or whatever cannot be tainted by imperfect humans Apr 1, 2007 3:47:24 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well im sure they said that statement long before molestation was an issue Apr 1, 2007 3:47:25 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: It applied to other imperfect acts of priests Apr 1, 2007 3:47:52 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: corruption very early on in the church Apr 1, 2007 3:47:57 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but I still think the whole organization is based on nothing, as mntbike would say, so it is very easy for them to make up an excuse when something like child molestation happens Apr 1, 2007 3:48:26 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: People should stop accepting the Church's excuses and not be afraid of opposing it Apr 1, 2007 3:49:22 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I guess my other question would be, besides the fasting that Rocketship mentioned earlier and the attitude toward homosexuality, are there any other beliefs that you think the Catholic Church should change in order to conform to life in the 21st century Apr 1, 2007 3:49:34 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: People in general shoudl question their beliefs and have some self-reliance Apr 1, 2007 3:49:44 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: the gender issue Apr 1, 2007 3:49:53 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: agreed Apr 1, 2007 3:49:53 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I don't exactly thik that there's a lack of people who oppose the Catholic Church Apr 1, 2007 3:50:08 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: or for that matter, institutionalized religion in general Apr 1, 2007 3:50:21 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: so if the catholic church is so corrupt and built on nothing do you think if it were a possibility, it should just be dissemble altogether Apr 1, 2007 3:50:27 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: think*, exuse me Apr 1, 2007 3:50:27 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: ? Apr 1, 2007 3:50:30 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Thats exactly what I think Apr 1, 2007 3:50:49 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: well, then, I guess wel Apr 1, 2007 3:51:29 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I feel like there's so many people who are catholic simply because they're afraid of what will happen to them if they aren' Apr 1, 2007 3:51:32 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Well what I am saying is to believe what you wish but base it on reason and question what you believe, do not merely accept things, and if you do not believe in the Church, then it means nothing to you, but it can still be there for the people who do believe in it Apr 1, 2007 3:51:33 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: sorry, Apr 1, 2007 3:51:34 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i guess we'll just have to agree to disagree, is what i meant to say Apr 1, 2007 3:51:46 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yea mtnbike Apr 1, 2007 3:51:49 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: okay that's a fair statement Apr 1, 2007 3:52:33 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so, Rocket Ship, belief should be based on reason? Apr 1, 2007 3:52:44 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I certainly think so Apr 1, 2007 3:52:56 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: those strongly in support of religion may say faith Apr 1, 2007 3:53:06 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but that faith must have some root in reason Apr 1, 2007 3:53:13 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: how do you establish that faith Apr 1, 2007 3:53:17 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: it did not materialize Apr 1, 2007 3:53:21 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yes some root, but entirely? Apr 1, 2007 3:53:28 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: it only matters that there is some root Apr 1, 2007 3:53:41 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: It could seem ridiculous to have all of the faith in the world that pigs will fly Apr 1, 2007 3:54:01 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but it is not backed with reason Apr 1, 2007 3:54:05 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: because many doctors of the Catholic Church do make arguments in support of faith by using reason Apr 1, 2007 3:54:12 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: there is some reason in Christianity in the sense that some of these historical figures existed Apr 1, 2007 3:54:20 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but certainly not enough reason to call if truth Apr 1, 2007 3:54:26 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: therefore, if you wish to believe, faith is involved Apr 1, 2007 3:54:33 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: right, is it so wrong for people to have faith? Apr 1, 2007 3:54:46 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: That should be a shot in the foot Apr 1, 2007 3:54:48 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: or is that just taboo in the 21st century? Apr 1, 2007 3:54:57 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: not necessarily, if they wish, I think they should question their reason though instead of merely accepting and going through empty practices as I believe many people do Apr 1, 2007 3:55:14 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: ah, so now we are speaking of the Catholic Church in terms of the lay people, am I right? Apr 1, 2007 3:57:00 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: yes Apr 1, 2007 3:57:15 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: sure it's off topic, but it came up Apr 1, 2007 3:57:20 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: the lay people? Apr 1, 2007 3:57:24 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yes, those who don't belong to the holy orders Apr 1, 2007 3:58:13 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: like, the priesthood, or nuns Apr 1, 2007 3:58:28 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: ohh okay Apr 1, 2007 3:58:30 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I think that there's so many dissenting views of Catholics within the Catholic Church that no general statement can be made about them Apr 1, 2007 3:59:36 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: perhaps Apr 1, 2007 4:00:20 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: seems to be the case Apr 1, 2007 4:00:32 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah it's kind of hard to generalize a group so inconsistent Apr 1, 2007 4:02:07 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: If I may add something about the positive role the Church plays in the 21st century, it is the source of some of the greatest amounts of service performed Apr 1, 2007 4:02:18 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I can agree with that Apr 1, 2007 4:02:37 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and I don't think that that should change Apr 1, 2007 4:02:38 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: indeed i hope it doesn't Apr 1, 2007 4:02:49 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah definitely can agree with that Apr 1, 2007 4:02:49 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: It is rather unfortunate, however, we need such an organization to get us to do service Apr 1, 2007 4:02:58 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: yeah Apr 1, 2007 4:03:08 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well theres other organizations that do service, just none so prominent Apr 1, 2007 4:03:28 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: yes Apr 1, 2007 4:03:39 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and I think that the Church's humanitarian role extends even further, to the defense of life, and I think that their stance on issueds like abortion and the death penality and war are important to our society in the 21st century as well Apr 1, 2007 4:05:27 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Sure, they have some good stances, but again I think it somewhat sad that we need an organization to tell us those things, but perhaps some people need that Apr 1, 2007 4:06:09 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well we go to a catholic school, im sure a lot of people who participate in community service wouldn't if the school didin't support it so much Apr 1, 2007 4:07:27 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: ok we can stop here if you'd like guys Apr 1, 2007 4:09:35 PM EDT
