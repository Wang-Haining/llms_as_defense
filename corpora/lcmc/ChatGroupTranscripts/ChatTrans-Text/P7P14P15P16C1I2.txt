CMC sun_beauty: but how Mar 27, 2007 8:07:52 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: b/c otherwise we would leave the country worse then when we went in Mar 27, 2007 8:08:05 PM EDT

CMC spacestare86: see if we just pull out Mar 27, 2007 8:08:23 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: and maybe set up something temporary Mar 27, 2007 8:08:28 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: then it will be like russia doing it to afganistan Mar 27, 2007 8:08:35 PM EDT

CMC sun_beauty: they werent poor enough to smash two planes into a building Mar 27, 2007 8:09:39 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: well we should...b/c somone is going to take them over once we leave them in shambls...and that someone is prob going to hate us and just get us further into war Mar 27, 2007 8:09:41 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: be careful with your use of "they" Mar 27, 2007 8:10:13 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: before categorizing all Middle Easterners as terrorists Mar 27, 2007 8:10:32 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: that was a completely different group of people who smashed the planes Mar 27, 2007 8:10:39 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah...wich makes this war even wierder Mar 27, 2007 8:10:55 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: but in answering frankie27's question on where wepons will come from....there are black markets Mar 27, 2007 8:11:23 PM EDT

CMC frankie27: if we spent our money on protecting the homefront in the US instead of on the war, wouldnt we be better off? Mar 27, 2007 8:12:00 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: common mistake, i think we can forgive you sun beauty Mar 27, 2007 8:12:10 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: so give more money to the failing homeland security? Mar 27, 2007 8:12:26 PM EDT

CMC spacestare86: what would the more money do? Mar 27, 2007 8:13:18 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: pay more people to protect us Mar 27, 2007 8:13:34 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: i mean the patriot act has already done enough damage, and we already have the capability to destroy anyone in the world..how are we going to "protect" ourselves? Mar 27, 2007 8:13:36 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i agree Mar 27, 2007 8:13:49 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i think our best bet it to fix what we stared and leave Mar 27, 2007 8:14:18 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i feel like we are all just repeating what we said on tues Mar 27, 2007 8:14:40 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: easier said then done Mar 27, 2007 8:14:47 PM EDT

CMC sun_beauty: k Mar 27, 2007 8:18:31 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: oh, ps,...i just noticed that the time for this is off Mar 27, 2007 8:19:15 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: hours after 9/11 rumsfeld had notes recorded that have recently been found that said "judge whether good enough [to] hit S.H. at same time" and "Go massive . . . Sweep it all up. Things related and not." Mar 27, 2007 8:19:23 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: it is 8:19, not 7:19 Mar 27, 2007 8:19:28 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: oh, yeah, i remeber you saying that last time Mar 27, 2007 8:19:45 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: mine says 8:19 btw Mar 27, 2007 8:19:51 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: the little gray date next to our comments? Mar 27, 2007 8:20:18 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: well thats pretty revealing, how rumsfeld said that Mar 27, 2007 8:20:22 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: or whoever it was Mar 27, 2007 8:20:35 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: yea rumsfeld Mar 27, 2007 8:20:42 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: ok Mar 27, 2007 8:20:48 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: b/c now i have compleate faith in our govt Mar 27, 2007 8:21:03 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: (that is sarcastic) Mar 27, 2007 8:21:10 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: it just shows even more how the whole war was based on lies Mar 27, 2007 8:21:12 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: you can find pictures here: http://flickr.com/photos/66726692@N00/sets/72057594065491946/ Mar 27, 2007 8:21:21 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: yea i agree Mar 27, 2007 8:21:28 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: haha Mar 27, 2007 8:21:36 PM EDT

CMC spacestare86: money Mar 27, 2007 8:21:56 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: me either Mar 27, 2007 8:21:57 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: there should be a huge investigation Mar 27, 2007 8:22:00 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: there should Mar 27, 2007 8:22:07 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: to just nail all those guys Mar 27, 2007 8:22:08 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i dont kno how they could sleep a night Mar 27, 2007 8:22:10 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: they were fired or quit before they were fired Mar 27, 2007 8:22:13 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: wut about bush tho? Mar 27, 2007 8:22:21 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: yea what about him? Mar 27, 2007 8:22:31 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: it is kinda like the water gate scandle Mar 27, 2007 8:22:35 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: could he be impeached for doin what he did? Mar 27, 2007 8:22:39 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: only he is not in a hole yet Mar 27, 2007 8:22:41 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: like he is, but not in the same way Mar 27, 2007 8:22:55 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: well it takes a lot more for an presidential impeachment trial then lets say, firing an attorney general Mar 27, 2007 8:22:55 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: oh aight Mar 27, 2007 8:23:07 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: how about lying to the whole country Mar 27, 2007 8:23:12 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: "faulty intelligence" is obviously a cover up and a lie Mar 27, 2007 8:23:39 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: and while we are in the middle of the war that would be seen both as a waste of time and money, and our enemies would certainly jump on it Mar 27, 2007 8:23:40 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: again, kinda like water gate...only bush does not have two reporters getting inside tips from "deepthroat" Mar 27, 2007 8:23:40 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: yeah he has more than 2 Mar 27, 2007 8:23:59 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: wut would our enemies jump on? Mar 27, 2007 8:24:10 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: more than 2 what? Mar 27, 2007 8:24:21 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: you dont think a presidential impeachment trial and the disunity of our country would be enough for enemies to increase attacks? Mar 27, 2007 8:24:42 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i agree Mar 27, 2007 8:24:52 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: i cant predict the future, so i dont know Mar 27, 2007 8:24:57 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: thats why i think we shouldnt just pull out of iraq right now Mar 27, 2007 8:25:06 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: so we can impeach Bush? Mar 27, 2007 8:25:31 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: yes Mar 27, 2007 8:25:35 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: again, that idea when russia did that to afganistan did not work out so well for them Mar 27, 2007 8:25:36 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: or afghanistan Mar 27, 2007 8:25:55 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: and put in another president Mar 27, 2007 8:25:57 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: and hey guess what groups were formed after Russia's withdrawal? Mar 27, 2007 8:26:22 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: the same groups that drove planes into WTYC Mar 27, 2007 8:26:39 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: WTC Mar 27, 2007 8:26:44 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah Mar 27, 2007 8:26:48 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: exactly Mar 27, 2007 8:26:54 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: yes but they were funded by bin laden, who had tons of money Mar 27, 2007 8:26:56 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: and who is to say that there are not other people with tons of money waiting to fund peopel who wish to attack us Mar 27, 2007 8:27:28 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: and you dont think there would be one sympathetic arms dealing rich Arab to spawn more terrorist groups? Mar 27, 2007 8:27:35 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: what is preventing them from forming now tho? Mar 27, 2007 8:27:56 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: who says thery are not Mar 27, 2007 8:28:12 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: they are just supressed right now Mar 27, 2007 8:28:24 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: wow u guys no alot about this Mar 27, 2007 8:28:34 PM EDT

CMC spacestare86: ummm so yeah Mar 27, 2007 8:29:47 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: livingdeadbeat or frankie....anything else to say? Mar 27, 2007 8:30:11 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i know you guys have to have something Mar 27, 2007 8:30:20 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: basically after russia withdrew from afghanistanin the late 80's, a group was formed that eventually became the Taliban, and were debating whether or not this could happen with Iraq Mar 27, 2007 8:30:23 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: yeah Mar 27, 2007 8:30:36 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: just cuz you said you were lost Mar 27, 2007 8:30:37 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: of course it can happen Mar 27, 2007 8:30:52 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: im just saying that us being there is probably not preventing it from happening Mar 27, 2007 8:31:15 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: so we might as well pull out Mar 27, 2007 8:31:25 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: but the question is, which is worse Mar 27, 2007 8:31:35 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: there are pros and cons to both Mar 27, 2007 8:31:45 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: we're guaranteed to lose americans while we're in iraq Mar 27, 2007 8:32:00 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i agree and thanks livingdeadbeat Mar 27, 2007 8:32:08 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: but we might lose them if we pull out Mar 27, 2007 8:32:09 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: yea even more too Mar 27, 2007 8:32:19 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: maybe tho Mar 27, 2007 8:32:24 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: yet if we kickstart their economy and try to get them on their feet, the likelihood of repeated attacks grows smaller Mar 27, 2007 8:32:34 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: and who is to say that there may not be another 9/11 Mar 27, 2007 8:32:34 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i agree again!!! Mar 27, 2007 8:32:45 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: exactly Mar 27, 2007 8:32:45 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: if we could do that, we should Mar 27, 2007 8:32:52 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: obviously Mar 27, 2007 8:32:57 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: i agree with livingdeadbeat Mar 27, 2007 8:32:59 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: but if there is no feasible way to do that... Mar 27, 2007 8:33:03 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: ok, so... Mar 27, 2007 8:33:14 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: there has gotta be a way Mar 27, 2007 8:33:16 PM EDT

CMC frankie27: wut does then? Mar 27, 2007 8:47:14 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: if we supported them from outside the country with just financial and economic aid, and whatever else they need, then they cant hate us for that reason Mar 27, 2007 8:47:15 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: i agree with spacestare again!!! Mar 27, 2007 8:47:20 PM EDT
CMC sun_beauty: but who says we are gonna do that??? Mar 27, 2007 8:47:38 PM EDT

CMC spacestare86: i dont like that we are still there, and i dont like that we are sending people over there...eps when it is people that i know Mar 27, 2007 8:48:45 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: well obviously if the government goes against their word and doesnt provide aid, we cant help that, but in theory it could work Mar 27, 2007 8:49:10 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: but i would just want to see what else is brought to the table b/f a jummpy desision is made Mar 27, 2007 8:49:25 PM EDT
CMC spacestare86: who knows...maybe pulling out will turn out to be the best option Mar 27, 2007 8:49:45 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: we would have to find a way to keep track of their expenses, too Mar 27, 2007 8:49:46 PM EDT

CMC spacestare86: yeah Mar 27, 2007 8:52:23 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: we are trying to force American belief systems and political presence in a country whose Islamic population doesnt mesh at all with what we are trying to force on them Mar 27, 2007 8:53:23 PM EDT
CMC frankie27: and so many american beliefs are based on christianity Mar 27, 2007 8:53:55 PM EDT
CMC livingdeadbeat87: and for some reason our country doesnt understand that not everywhere in the world do citizens want to be more ilke americans Mar 27, 2007 8:54:02 PM EDT
