Melissa Carbone: OK, your first topic is privacy, how do you all feel about school officials being able to read myspace and facebook profiles Mar 25, 2007 2:04:06 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: is it an invasion of privacy if students get in trouble from something they had on their profile Mar 25, 2007 2:04:28 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: It is a public website Mar 25, 2007 2:04:35 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: definitely not, it's a public site Mar 25, 2007 2:04:39 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I believe anyone has the right to see those things since they are put on the net, not under any sort of privacy Mar 25, 2007 2:04:43 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: using the information is a different issue Mar 25, 2007 2:04:48 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: it's a right that everyone is entitled to, including school officials Mar 25, 2007 2:04:57 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what kind of issue is using the information? Mar 25, 2007 2:05:19 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: why is it a different issue? Mar 25, 2007 2:05:21 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I feel like its a situational kind of thing Mar 25, 2007 2:05:47 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: By the very language of my answer, it's a different issue...reading and using are two different verbs, and thus two different issues Mar 25, 2007 2:06:01 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Exactly Mar 25, 2007 2:06:08 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: in the case of shootings, yea use it...in the case of a campus party or something Mar 25, 2007 2:06:19 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: If the info is used to prevent a school shooting, then there's no way you can ignore it Mar 25, 2007 2:06:26 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: seems like they are not really using the information for a just cause Mar 25, 2007 2:06:34 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so, it's okay to use the information to protect students? Mar 25, 2007 2:07:09 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I feel so Mar 25, 2007 2:07:16 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: okay yeah that's true, but at the same time you shouldn't put things up that you don't want to get in trouble for later Mar 25, 2007 2:07:21 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: when people's lives are in danger, yes Mar 25, 2007 2:07:22 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and alcohol doesn't endanger people's lives? Mar 25, 2007 2:07:37 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: which would be like shooting information Mar 25, 2007 2:07:43 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: under-aged drinking doesn't endanger people's lives? Mar 25, 2007 2:07:46 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: no, not necessarily Mar 25, 2007 2:07:46 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: without moderation maybe Mar 25, 2007 2:07:52 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: stupid people endanger themselves Mar 25, 2007 2:08:00 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Food can endanger your life under your argument Mar 25, 2007 2:08:01 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but there is a thing called moderation Mar 25, 2007 2:08:05 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: eating isn't illegal Mar 25, 2007 2:08:10 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: drinking isnt illegal Mar 25, 2007 2:08:16 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: under-age drinking is Mar 25, 2007 2:08:21 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: ...? Mar 25, 2007 2:08:22 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: we are not making that distinction Mar 25, 2007 2:08:32 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: 30 years ago the drinking age was 18 Mar 25, 2007 2:08:34 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: people can be in college, of age, and drink Mar 25, 2007 2:08:36 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i am making that distinction, what about high school kids? Mar 25, 2007 2:08:52 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and the laws from 30 years ago don't matter, the laws now matter Mar 25, 2007 2:09:13 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Its more of a parental thing Mar 25, 2007 2:09:16 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: At the same time, are those pictures necessarily incriminating evidence Mar 25, 2007 2:09:17 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well they can be Mar 25, 2007 2:09:30 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: How so Mar 25, 2007 2:09:35 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: if parents are concerned about their kids drinking or doing drugs it definitely is Mar 25, 2007 2:09:54 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: No, my question is how is that incriminating evidence Mar 25, 2007 2:10:15 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: if you don't want your parents to know your business don't post i up where anywhere can see it Mar 25, 2007 2:10:19 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: a picture...what does it prove without a doubt? Mar 25, 2007 2:10:20 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: True, I am not arguing that Mar 25, 2007 2:10:29 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well if you're holding a beer can Mar 25, 2007 2:10:31 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: it can have water in it Mar 25, 2007 2:10:36 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: you dont have to be drinking it Mar 25, 2007 2:10:38 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: While it is likely you were drinking it Mar 25, 2007 2:10:47 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: then why take a picture with it? Mar 25, 2007 2:10:49 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: it does not prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt Mar 25, 2007 2:10:52 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: it gives reason for suspicion Mar 25, 2007 2:11:03 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: why take a picture with your face in those wooden sets at theme parks...are you really a space cadet? Mar 25, 2007 2:11:08 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Sure Mar 25, 2007 2:11:10 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: okay so if someonw posts on your wall "yeah dude last weekend was so great we got sooo wasted" Mar 25, 2007 2:11:14 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: and your parents see that Mar 25, 2007 2:11:18 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Sure they can make an educated guess that you were drinking Mar 25, 2007 2:11:32 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but it is not perfect evidence Mar 25, 2007 2:11:39 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well i'm sure you'll have a really good defense whe you're confronted about it Mar 25, 2007 2:11:57 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: probably not Mar 25, 2007 2:12:06 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: don't schools have a responsibility to protect the students, whether it be from shootings, or the influence of drugs and alcohol? Mar 25, 2007 2:12:12 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: That is the question at hand Mar 25, 2007 2:12:25 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: school shootings are an infinitely more serious issue Mar 25, 2007 2:12:45 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: and my personal feeling it yes when lives are in danger, but do they really have a right to step in on lesser matters as well...they are not law enforcement team of the country Mar 25, 2007 2:12:53 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Can schools, beyond their educating duties, be cops as well Mar 25, 2007 2:13:08 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: do we have room in the budget for that as well Mar 25, 2007 2:13:12 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well i don't think a school should be able to punish studnets for drugs or alcohol if it didn't happen on the school's campus Mar 25, 2007 2:13:13 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Right Mar 25, 2007 2:13:20 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: out of their jurisdiction Mar 25, 2007 2:13:25 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: perfect point Janada Mar 25, 2007 2:13:30 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: hey thanks Mar 25, 2007 2:13:37 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: what i don't understand though is why you would post up your plans to shoot up a school where everyone can see it Mar 25, 2007 2:14:45 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: What do you guys think about the government listening in on phone conversations? Mar 25, 2007 2:14:46 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Maybe its a cry for help Mar 25, 2007 2:15:05 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Perhaps Mar 25, 2007 2:15:09 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: that is an invasion of privacy Mar 25, 2007 2:15:12 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: does not make sense to me at all Mar 25, 2007 2:15:13 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well if that's the case, then that's one thing, but if you really intended on carrying it out, that's just crazy Mar 25, 2007 2:15:26 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: You just made the argument though, Klutzo, that it is a worth-while cause for people doing drugs or alcohol Mar 25, 2007 2:15:38 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well i have a situation that actually happened to my family that's kind of related to the phone thing and i definitely agree that its an invasion of privacy Mar 25, 2007 2:15:57 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: that what is a worth while cause? Mar 25, 2007 2:15:59 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yea, regardless of the information medium Mar 25, 2007 2:16:09 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I do too Mar 25, 2007 2:16:20 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: that what is a worthwhile cause? Mar 25, 2007 2:16:34 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I think the distinction is that you use those websites with the knowledge that they are public, you approach a phone infromation transmission as private, and it should be treate as such Mar 25, 2007 2:16:51 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: that what is a worthwhile cause? Mar 25, 2007 2:17:14 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: agreed - the internet is not a private place to begin with Mar 25, 2007 2:17:21 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I thought your argument was that they schools should be able to go after the people if it was for stuff like alcohol as well as shootings Mar 25, 2007 2:17:22 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: so its not really an invasion of one's privacy Mar 25, 2007 2:17:36 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yes, and your point is? Mar 25, 2007 2:17:52 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: But you say no to that use of information if the medium is a phone Mar 25, 2007 2:18:09 PM EDT
[CMC Janada18 left the session] Mar 25, 2007 2:18:13 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i'm not saying the school should listen in on ur phone calls Mar 25, 2007 2:18:15 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Also I believe the internet can be set up to be used privately Mar 25, 2007 2:18:20 PM EDT
[CMC Janada18 joined the session] Mar 25, 2007 2:18:22 PM EDT
[CMC Janada18 left the session] Mar 25, 2007 2:18:24 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: those sites, however, clearly were not Mar 25, 2007 2:18:24 PM EDT
[CMC Janada18 joined the session] Mar 25, 2007 2:18:27 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: sorry about ath Mar 25, 2007 2:18:34 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: But if they came across that information, not use it? Mar 25, 2007 2:18:41 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: right, so internet is different from phone Mar 25, 2007 2:18:43 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yes Mar 25, 2007 2:18:47 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: what about e-mail? Mar 25, 2007 2:18:54 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: email is private Mar 25, 2007 2:19:03 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: the person who receives or sends the email can choose to share it with anyone Mar 25, 2007 2:19:14 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: True Mar 25, 2007 2:19:28 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: emails are used in trials as evidence Mar 25, 2007 2:19:32 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but to catch the e-mail in transmission is a different story Mar 25, 2007 2:19:35 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: so are phone conversations Mar 25, 2007 2:19:43 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: can u do that? Mar 25, 2007 2:19:43 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: without the knowledge of either sender or recipient Mar 25, 2007 2:19:45 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Sure can Mar 25, 2007 2:19:47 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i have a question for everyone Mar 25, 2007 2:20:36 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: a different story how? Mar 25, 2007 2:20:40 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: it's based a real life situation Mar 25, 2007 2:20:48 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: that happened at the elementary school where my mom works Mar 25, 2007 2:20:59 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: a groups of kids in the seventh grade formed a hate group on myspace Mar 25, 2007 2:21:18 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: directed at one girl in particular Mar 25, 2007 2:21:25 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: It would be a different story Janada because neither the recipient nor the sender gave permission to read the e-mail Mar 25, 2007 2:21:39 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: if you're the principal and you come across this information, what do you do? Mar 25, 2007 2:21:42 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: it was captured in transmission Mar 25, 2007 2:21:43 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I would leave it be Mar 25, 2007 2:22:07 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Kids have always had fights and what-not with one another Mar 25, 2007 2:22:25 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: oh okay, sorry i read that in the wrong context Mar 25, 2007 2:22:26 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Alright Mar 25, 2007 2:22:30 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: as to Klutzo, I am not entirely sure, those kids do have a right to free speech, but since the information is made public, maybe just make that kid and her parents aware it is there, but as a school, I do not think they should take any action beyond that Mar 25, 2007 2:23:04 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what would you do Janada? Mar 25, 2007 2:23:35 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Was there anything that happened in school? Mar 25, 2007 2:23:42 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well before myspace, kids formed actual hate groups like on the playground so it's not really any different to put it on the internet, and kids are punished anyways for being mean to other students so i don't think it should be handled any differently Mar 25, 2007 2:23:57 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i don't think that anyhing had happened yet in school Mar 25, 2007 2:24:05 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: to the teachers' knowledge Mar 25, 2007 2:24:21 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: happened to her you mean? Mar 25, 2007 2:24:25 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yes Mar 25, 2007 2:24:28 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: yeah, I mean theryre only 7th graders Mar 25, 2007 2:24:30 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: so they arent mature yet Mar 25, 2007 2:24:41 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i mean it's cruel, but that's how kids are Mar 25, 2007 2:25:07 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: right Mar 25, 2007 2:25:13 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: they choose someone different to hate every week Mar 25, 2007 2:25:23 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so mtnbike, you would leave the situation entirely alone, you wouldn't even talk to the kids to try and help them resolve their differences? Mar 25, 2007 2:25:33 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: not unless they got in a fight at school Mar 25, 2007 2:25:48 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but this group was in existence for a while, and growing Mar 25, 2007 2:25:49 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what about informing the parents? Mar 25, 2007 2:26:13 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well the problem is nothing has happened at school yet Mar 25, 2007 2:26:16 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: but if there was no confrontation at school, what's the problem? Mar 25, 2007 2:26:27 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Right again, I think you have to look at this from situation to situation with the main factors being relevance of information to the school or whatever establishment is evaluating the information, see if that information is under your jurisdiction, but when it comes to human safety, that should be an issue for all - does anyone else think they have any sort of generalizations on the topic yet Mar 25, 2007 2:26:35 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: ? Mar 25, 2007 2:26:37 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: u don't see a problem with hate groups? Mar 25, 2007 2:26:42 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i mean the students have done anything to her on school grounds Mar 25, 2007 2:26:46 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: what do you mean by hate group? Mar 25, 2007 2:27:17 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: is it a racial thing, or just "so and so is such a nerd?" Mar 25, 2007 2:27:46 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: it was a racial thing, though i don't know what race exactly... I apologize I don't rmember all of the details Mar 25, 2007 2:28:41 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I feel it would be unlikely for the students to hate someone so strongly and not act on it in school Mar 25, 2007 2:28:44 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: you know what I mean? Mar 25, 2007 2:29:34 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i do, but I wonder if they had not been found out, if something might have happened Mar 25, 2007 2:29:54 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: If anything at all happened at school, I would treat it just like any other incident Mar 25, 2007 2:30:52 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what the principal did do was call a meeting with all of the parents of the entire grade and gave a information session about myspace and warned about its dangers, and its lack of privacy Mar 25, 2007 2:30:58 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: suspend the students, notify parents Mar 25, 2007 2:31:05 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: but not come out and say anything about the group? Mar 25, 2007 2:31:40 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: how unsecure it is and how easily accessble it is Mar 25, 2007 2:31:43 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: oh no, talked about the group Mar 25, 2007 2:31:53 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: ok Mar 25, 2007 2:31:57 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: gave detention to the participants Mar 25, 2007 2:32:00 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: it was a very big deal Mar 25, 2007 2:32:39 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Im not sure I understand how they could give them detention Mar 25, 2007 2:32:49 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i'm not either, but it's what they did Mar 25, 2007 2:33:22 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I do not agree with that Mar 25, 2007 2:33:33 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i don't either Mar 25, 2007 2:33:48 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I'm not sure I do either, but I do agree that some sort of action had to be taken Mar 25, 2007 2:33:56 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I think the school can only control students within their jurisdiction within school property or school sanctioned trip off of property Mar 25, 2007 2:34:01 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Detention was not right Mar 25, 2007 2:34:09 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: they did nothing wrong at school Mar 25, 2007 2:34:13 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: If there's no direct threat, people have a right to free speech Mar 25, 2007 2:34:17 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: If I may ask your opinion about another situation that happened at my high school Mar 25, 2007 2:34:56 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Sure Mar 25, 2007 2:35:06 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: there were pictures online of several girls who went to my high school, pictures of a party where they were drinking Mar 25, 2007 2:35:29 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: one of the girls was looking at these pictures from a school computer Mar 25, 2007 2:35:45 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: during the school day Mar 25, 2007 2:35:49 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and the school administration has access to all the sites accessed by students from school computers Mar 25, 2007 2:36:18 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and they use this access to monitor the students' activity on those computers Mar 25, 2007 2:36:34 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and so the principal saw these pictures Mar 25, 2007 2:36:42 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: no disciplinary action was taken by the school Mar 25, 2007 2:36:51 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Interesting, first off though, I think those sites should be blocked Mar 25, 2007 2:36:54 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: at school Mar 25, 2007 2:36:56 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Again, its not up to the school to administer the law Mar 25, 2007 2:37:02 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but the principal did notify the parents Mar 25, 2007 2:37:03 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Does not really seem to be his right to do so Mar 25, 2007 2:37:14 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: that seems fair Mar 25, 2007 2:37:18 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: her right, lol Mar 25, 2007 2:37:24 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Sorry Mar 25, 2007 2:37:34 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i agree i don't think the parents should be notified Mar 25, 2007 2:37:57 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yes, that is not his job Mar 25, 2007 2:38:22 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: wait, going back to what Rocket ship said, you think that all websites that allow people to post pictures should be blocked at school? Mar 25, 2007 2:38:30 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Not all websites Mar 25, 2007 2:38:43 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: the principle didnt directly do any disciplining directly - he let the parents handle it Mar 25, 2007 2:38:50 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i know in my high school they blocked facebook and myspace because students would check them when they should be doing work, it seems like the best way to do things in order to avoid these situations Mar 25, 2007 2:39:01 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yes Mar 25, 2007 2:39:08 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: are you condoning or condemning that fact, mtnbike? Mar 25, 2007 2:39:10 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: what fact? Mar 25, 2007 2:39:30 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: that the principal didn't directly do any disciplining directyl - he let the parents handle it Mar 25, 2007 2:39:50 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i mean he or she didnt give detention or anything, right? Mar 25, 2007 2:40:17 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: right, and just notified the parents, I wasn't sure whether you supported this course of action or not Mar 25, 2007 2:40:42 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I guess I support it. But I dont think the school should keep a record of all the websites that were visited in a day Mar 25, 2007 2:41:29 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: seems like a misallocation of resources Mar 25, 2007 2:41:41 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: what if people are downloading harmful material Mar 25, 2007 2:41:53 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: like what? Mar 25, 2007 2:41:59 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: like, i don't know, porn Mar 25, 2007 2:42:04 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah i'm pretty sure every high school keeps track of what sites students visit Mar 25, 2007 2:42:12 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: how is that harmful? Mar 25, 2007 2:42:16 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: You can block those sorts of things, downloads and access Mar 25, 2007 2:42:16 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: yes, but you have to make sure students don't find a way aroun dit Mar 25, 2007 2:42:30 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I am with Janada in the fac that a simply, sophisticated upfront job on the IT side of things could have mitigated all of these problems Mar 25, 2007 2:42:39 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: they tried to block AIM at my high school too, but somehow some students found a way around it Mar 25, 2007 2:43:01 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: AIM express Mar 25, 2007 2:43:51 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah i don't understand why you'd get on AIM during school anyways, aren't all your friends basically sitting next to you in class? Mar 25, 2007 2:44:27 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: it's not a question of why they do it, it's the fact that somehow they are able to do it Mar 25, 2007 2:44:51 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: i dont think its that big of a deal anyway Mar 25, 2007 2:44:55 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: if students want to waste their time on aim at school, that's their loss Mar 25, 2007 2:45:18 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: What do you all think of the Patriot Act? Mar 25, 2007 2:45:51 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well if the school can monitor that you've been on facebook or whatever site, they can monitor that too, and you can still get into trouble Mar 25, 2007 2:46:00 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i know my school would suspend people from the library for stupid things like that Mar 25, 2007 2:46:20 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: well yes, the library is a place for research and study Mar 25, 2007 2:46:38 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: not chatting Mar 25, 2007 2:46:47 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well not so much at my school, kinds kind of just went there to get out of class or study hall and hang out with their friends Mar 25, 2007 2:47:27 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: hence, why they'd get on aim and such Mar 25, 2007 2:47:39 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i see Mar 25, 2007 2:47:45 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: isn't it the school's responsibility to foster the best possible environment for learning? Mar 25, 2007 2:48:08 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and doesn't blocking AIM, games, and things like Myspace trying to creat that environment Mar 25, 2007 2:48:37 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: Its up to the students to get the most out of their education Mar 25, 2007 2:48:41 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: True Mar 25, 2007 2:48:56 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: you can always find ways to deviate from the education Mar 25, 2007 2:49:03 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yeah but i went to a public school with roughly 2000 students and they were too busy worring abour people "thrusting" at dances and stuff Mar 25, 2007 2:49:04 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: schools should provide, not restrict Mar 25, 2007 2:49:10 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: so teachers and administrators shouldn't try to help the students get the most out of their education? Mar 25, 2007 2:49:22 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: They should Mar 25, 2007 2:49:32 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: no they should, but ultimately it's up to the student Mar 25, 2007 2:49:38 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yes Mar 25, 2007 2:49:42 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: They can do all they want, but it takes the will of the student for any of it to work Mar 25, 2007 2:49:56 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: They can cut distractions to aide in that, but it is still ultimately up to the student Mar 25, 2007 2:50:08 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: right, and blocking AIM, etc. is cutting distractions Mar 25, 2007 2:50:24 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: yes Mar 25, 2007 2:50:35 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yes Mar 25, 2007 2:50:57 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: besides, if education were ultimately up the student, why are there compulsory school attendence laws Mar 25, 2007 2:51:11 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I think its ok to use aim if you have a free period, but its not ok to use it in class Mar 25, 2007 2:52:17 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well if your education is important, you'll show up for class Mar 25, 2007 2:52:23 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but use aim where, on school computers? Mar 25, 2007 2:52:36 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: and the attendence police won't be an issue Mar 25, 2007 2:52:40 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: yeah Mar 25, 2007 2:52:40 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: That's an example of the educators promoting education to the students Mar 25, 2007 2:52:50 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: school computers that are meant for students to do work on? Mar 25, 2007 2:52:51 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: sure Mar 25, 2007 2:53:00 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: and that could be taking away from a student who actually needs to do work Mar 25, 2007 2:53:18 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: a "free" period is free for you to do whatever Mar 25, 2007 2:53:22 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: really, is it free for you to do drugs? Mar 25, 2007 2:53:41 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: if you want Mar 25, 2007 2:53:49 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: If that's your choice, yes Mar 25, 2007 2:53:52 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: on school property? Mar 25, 2007 2:53:55 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but you will get caught, most likely Mar 25, 2007 2:53:57 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: No, there are rules against that Mar 25, 2007 2:54:01 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: you just better not get caught Mar 25, 2007 2:54:05 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: exactly, just like there are rules against using AIM Mar 25, 2007 2:54:19 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: What's your point Mar 25, 2007 2:54:25 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: those really arent comparable Mar 25, 2007 2:54:27 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I've lost your point here Mar 25, 2007 2:54:31 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: I'm saying that "free" time is not time when you can do whatever you want Mar 25, 2007 2:54:53 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: why not? Mar 25, 2007 2:55:02 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: because schools have rules Mar 25, 2007 2:55:10 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: My school did not have rules against me walking the halls for 50 minutes during my free periods Mar 25, 2007 2:55:30 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: well obviously youre not allowed to smoke up in the bathroom Mar 25, 2007 2:55:35 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: but were you not just condoning that? Mar 25, 2007 2:55:51 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: because that is against the law Mar 25, 2007 2:55:56 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: No he's saying just because there are rules does not mean you cant do it Mar 25, 2007 2:56:11 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well i think that schools have a responsibilty to make sure you are safe during your free period, and that involves having some rules Mar 25, 2007 2:56:21 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I'm saying if you want to risk being caught, then go for it Mar 25, 2007 2:56:22 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: You get caught, those are the consequences Mar 25, 2007 2:56:24 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Right Mar 25, 2007 2:56:32 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: but it is up to the student whether or not to adhere Mar 25, 2007 2:56:39 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: I didn't condone it Mar 25, 2007 2:56:40 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: just having rules does not guarentee everyone will follow Mar 25, 2007 2:56:46 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: i know in my high school you weren't allowed to leave campus unles syou were a senior and had a certain gpa during free periods Mar 25, 2007 2:56:46 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: oh obviously not kids left all the time to go do drugs or whatever the hell else they wanted to do Mar 25, 2007 2:57:09 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Alright, so what is the issue here Mar 25, 2007 2:57:29 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: well you said not everyone would follow the rules and i was just giving an example, no issue Mar 25, 2007 2:58:11 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: i believe that it is blocking AIM, games, and sites like MySpace Mar 25, 2007 2:58:12 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: on school computers Mar 25, 2007 2:58:26 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: I know, I was just asking in general Mar 25, 2007 2:58:35 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Alright, I agree with that Mar 25, 2007 2:58:45 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: best way to mitigate it to block that stuff upfront Mar 25, 2007 2:58:53 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: If you put something up on the internet, its your responsibility to know that it isn't private information Mar 25, 2007 3:01:53 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: well, I think that schools have a responsibility to first and foremost provide a safe environment in which students can learn and grow Mar 25, 2007 3:01:56 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: My final thought, as we discussed, is that there must be some jurisdiction set to the establishment under which internet or other infromation is used. The information should be pertinent and relevant to that establishment and free speech must not be forgotten. Additionally, problems can be mitigated if schools and the like just understand the technology, block the technology, and not even allow for temptation Mar 25, 2007 3:02:25 PM EDT
CMC Klutzo178: and that they should act on any threats, suspicions, etc. that they find on public website like MySpace Mar 25, 2007 3:02:27 PM EDT
CMC Janada18: agreed, schools should provide safe environments but they should also know their bounds Mar 25, 2007 3:02:27 PM EDT
CMC Rocket_ship21: Yes Mar 25, 2007 3:02:35 PM EDT
CMC mtnbike9: agreed Mar 25, 2007 3:03:05 PM EDT
