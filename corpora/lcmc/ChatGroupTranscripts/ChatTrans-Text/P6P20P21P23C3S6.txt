Melissa Carbone: OK, do you all feel that gender discrimination is still present in the US? Apr 15, 2007 5:00:47 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: if so, what can we do to change it? Apr 15, 2007 5:00:55 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: YES Apr 15, 2007 5:00:57 PM EDT
CMC dah88: in some cases it is Apr 15, 2007 5:01:18 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: it's definitely still here, but disappearing slowly Apr 15, 2007 5:01:19 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: in reality, i don't think it will ever go away entirely Apr 15, 2007 5:01:26 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: sorry ladies Apr 15, 2007 5:01:28 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i dont think so either Apr 15, 2007 5:01:35 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: probably not Apr 15, 2007 5:01:54 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but we rarely consider gender bias against men Apr 15, 2007 5:01:59 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:02:00 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but it makes us feel better to have laws and stuff now Apr 15, 2007 5:02:04 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i'm sure it does Apr 15, 2007 5:02:18 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, it's a problem of changing attitudes that are eons old Apr 15, 2007 5:02:33 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: (okay, maybe not eons) Apr 15, 2007 5:02:44 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha Apr 15, 2007 5:02:48 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: (but you get the idea) Apr 15, 2007 5:02:54 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: do you think there's a gender bias against men at all? Apr 15, 2007 5:03:03 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yes Apr 15, 2007 5:03:08 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: like in nursing and stuff? Apr 15, 2007 5:03:13 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yes Apr 15, 2007 5:03:22 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: and yet again Apr 15, 2007 5:03:24 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i have a personal experience Apr 15, 2007 5:03:28 PM EDT
CMC dah88: and with the "stay at home mom" ideal Apr 15, 2007 5:03:30 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i'm a dude secretary........i get a lot of crap Apr 15, 2007 5:03:43 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Apr 15, 2007 5:03:44 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: aww Apr 15, 2007 5:03:56 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but half the time, it's me giving it to myself Apr 15, 2007 5:03:57 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: as a joke Apr 15, 2007 5:03:58 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: lol Apr 15, 2007 5:04:02 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: there are male secretary jokes? Apr 15, 2007 5:04:09 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha Apr 15, 2007 5:04:10 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: not that i know of Apr 15, 2007 5:04:15 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i just talke about how i get pinched in the butt and make coffee all the tiem (not the actual case though) Apr 15, 2007 5:04:32 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: time* Apr 15, 2007 5:04:37 PM EDT
CMC dah88: well it would be the same thing if i was a female construction worker Apr 15, 2007 5:04:40 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: hahaha Apr 15, 2007 5:04:41 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: very true Apr 15, 2007 5:04:47 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats true Apr 15, 2007 5:04:48 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, there are a lot of professions that are seen as being exclusively female, but a lot more that are considered male Apr 15, 2007 5:04:52 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: do you think that there is something wrong with some of those? Apr 15, 2007 5:05:13 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: for instance, most womens voices are more "pleasant" on the phone Apr 15, 2007 5:05:26 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think there are jobs that women can be more capable of and ones that men can Apr 15, 2007 5:05:32 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: naturally, they make good secretaries Apr 15, 2007 5:05:36 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (for that reason i mean) Apr 15, 2007 5:05:42 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think dah is right, some jobs just suit one sex more Apr 15, 2007 5:05:51 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but that doesnt mean someone of the opposite sex should be made uncomfortable for choosing a job like that Apr 15, 2007 5:06:17 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but that doesnt mean women cant be construction workers, its more that most wouldnt want t Apr 15, 2007 5:06:18 PM EDT
CMC dah88: to* Apr 15, 2007 5:06:21 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: right Apr 15, 2007 5:06:21 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yep Apr 15, 2007 5:06:27 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: and that's not in a discriminatory way either, like with construction, the men are just built for it Apr 15, 2007 5:06:28 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but if they did, it should be easy for them Apr 15, 2007 5:06:29 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, there are some big ladies out there also Apr 15, 2007 5:06:49 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: hey thats fine, i hope i'll never be a construction worker, personally Apr 15, 2007 5:06:51 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah, i mean women are offended than men are seen as stronger Apr 15, 2007 5:06:57 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: some women are Apr 15, 2007 5:07:11 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i don't understand that Apr 15, 2007 5:07:16 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but it really doesnt mean anything negative to women, just that men happen to get more fit for things like construction Apr 15, 2007 5:07:21 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: is that just insecurity or something? Apr 15, 2007 5:07:38 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i dont either, i mean i wouldnt ever be offended if someone told me i waasnt cut out for construction Apr 15, 2007 5:07:46 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: maybe since men are naturally stronger, they feel inferior for some reason? Apr 15, 2007 5:07:51 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i guess Apr 15, 2007 5:07:52 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: they're physiological differences, to a certain extent, too Apr 15, 2007 5:07:56 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well women are psychologically stronger apparently Apr 15, 2007 5:08:13 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: and i can totally see that Apr 15, 2007 5:08:19 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:08:24 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i will agree to that in a heartbeat Apr 15, 2007 5:08:35 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: absolutely Apr 15, 2007 5:08:48 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:08:49 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: best to keep in mind that that's an "on average"-type statement, though Apr 15, 2007 5:09:16 PM EDT
CMC dah88: well, what do you think about women being drafted? Apr 15, 2007 5:09:30 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: do you think women construction workers are ever denied promotion because they're women? Apr 15, 2007 5:09:32 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: ahhh i GUESS we should be, if the draft is reinstated Apr 15, 2007 5:09:49 PM EDT
CMC dah88: some people think that since women are so caught up with being equal to men that if there were to be a draft women should be too Apr 15, 2007 5:09:57 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i don' tthink that women should be drafted Apr 15, 2007 5:10:01 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but i dont agree with that Apr 15, 2007 5:10:07 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i mean, it should be up to them Apr 15, 2007 5:10:14 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, i don't think we should have a draft, period Apr 15, 2007 5:10:26 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but i definitely dont think all women are cut out to go to war Apr 15, 2007 5:10:34 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well im sure most men dont want to be drafted either, but they dont have a choice Apr 15, 2007 5:10:39 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, depends on the guy Apr 15, 2007 5:11:05 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i'm one of the few that wouldn't mind Apr 15, 2007 5:11:10 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (and i'm not trying to act macho by saying that) Apr 15, 2007 5:11:20 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: definitely not, but i mean isn't there a screening process or something after you're drafted? Apr 15, 2007 5:11:21 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: there is Apr 15, 2007 5:11:30 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: (talking about women being cut out for war) Apr 15, 2007 5:11:36 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: they tend to lower standards during times they're pressed for soldiers, though Apr 15, 2007 5:11:43 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: my dad was drafted for vietnam and then got denied Apr 15, 2007 5:11:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: for some problem he had Apr 15, 2007 5:11:52 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah it depends on like Apr 15, 2007 5:11:55 PM EDT
CMC dah88: health Apr 15, 2007 5:11:56 PM EDT
CMC dah88: and other issues Apr 15, 2007 5:12:00 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but, i agree with frogger Apr 15, 2007 5:12:08 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, the whole drafting women thing is very controversial Apr 15, 2007 5:12:33 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean, i personally don't think that they should be since they naturally aren't cut out for it as men, but if they want to be equal, then they should be treated as equals Apr 15, 2007 5:13:01 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: they just recently lowered the minimum acceptable test scores to get into the military, for instance Apr 15, 2007 5:13:05 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i'm like at a standstill Apr 15, 2007 5:13:06 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thinking in terms of helping our country: every soldier counts, and a lot of women would be perfectly capable of fighting for the country Apr 15, 2007 5:13:21 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats how i think anyhow Apr 15, 2007 5:13:37 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but at the same time, whether its a sterotype or not, a lot of women have a family that they would need to take care of if their husbands were sent off to war Apr 15, 2007 5:14:01 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: obviously you couldn't send a husband and a wife both off to war... Apr 15, 2007 5:14:18 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah lol Apr 15, 2007 5:14:21 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, there's no reason a husband can't stay home for the same reason, though Apr 15, 2007 5:14:22 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: there would be a lot to take into account Apr 15, 2007 5:14:27 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: so do you mean that the draft should count for women, and a lot should get denied, but the few capable ladies should go on? Apr 15, 2007 5:14:42 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah idk Apr 15, 2007 5:14:42 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but also with infants, the woman can't go because of natural needs of the baby Apr 15, 2007 5:15:00 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think they should draft everyone, but it should be a womans choice Apr 15, 2007 5:15:05 PM EDT
CMC dah88: if they have to draft Apr 15, 2007 5:15:14 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but if they want to be equal, then all of them should Apr 15, 2007 5:15:25 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well... but if they were going to choose to be in the army they would just enlist Apr 15, 2007 5:15:29 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that's like giving them an advantage Apr 15, 2007 5:15:37 PM EDT
CMC dah88: maybe, but i think a lot of women would go if they were called to rather than taking it upon themselves to enlist Apr 15, 2007 5:15:54 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: im not saying only the few capable should go on if they were drafted Apr 15, 2007 5:16:04 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: im saying those who meet requirements should go on Apr 15, 2007 5:16:14 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: same with men Apr 15, 2007 5:16:16 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: whoever fits the profile Apr 15, 2007 5:16:26 PM EDT
CMC dah88: well there are a lot of factors, women arent capable of the same things men are a lot of times, like the emotional factors of war Apr 15, 2007 5:17:10 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: right Apr 15, 2007 5:17:22 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: which is why not a tont of women are in the military now Apr 15, 2007 5:17:37 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: ton* Apr 15, 2007 5:17:40 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well wait a second Apr 15, 2007 5:17:46 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but every little bit helps Apr 15, 2007 5:17:46 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: what about earlier when we said that women are psychologically stronger? Apr 15, 2007 5:17:58 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (generally...) Apr 15, 2007 5:18:02 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: not when it comes to killing people.... Apr 15, 2007 5:18:12 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: lol Apr 15, 2007 5:18:13 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:18:15 PM EDT
CMC dah88: ahah Apr 15, 2007 5:18:16 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: just throwing it out there... Apr 15, 2007 5:18:23 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Apr 15, 2007 5:18:24 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: how many women serial killers and assassins are there? Apr 15, 2007 5:18:30 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: lol Apr 15, 2007 5:18:31 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i don't know that's a fair basis though...not enough women have been through war for their to be reliable psychological data on it Apr 15, 2007 5:18:57 PM EDT
CMC dah88: theyre psychologically stronger in more emotional aspects, but that doesnt mean they would be ok with shooting someone Apr 15, 2007 5:19:11 PM EDT
CMC dah88: thats why traditionally women are nurses and men are soldiers Apr 15, 2007 5:19:27 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: true Apr 15, 2007 5:19:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that's a terrific point Apr 15, 2007 5:19:54 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i mean, there was a reason that separation happened int he first place Apr 15, 2007 5:20:03 PM EDT
CMC dah88: haha, thanks Apr 15, 2007 5:20:03 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: not good....terrific....good job Apr 15, 2007 5:20:05 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Apr 15, 2007 5:20:05 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, i think the separation descends from the men being hunter/gatherers more than anything else. it has to do w/ women's stereotypical role as a nurturing gender. that doesn't mean that they're psychologically less capable of killing people, it just means that's the role associated with them Apr 15, 2007 5:21:24 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah, and stereotypically men are more aggressive than women, theyre just more cut out for it Apr 15, 2007 5:22:00 PM EDT
CMC dah88: which doesnt mean some women arent Apr 15, 2007 5:22:04 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: true Apr 15, 2007 5:22:16 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but if you dont use it, you lose it Apr 15, 2007 5:22:28 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: so maybe because of their nurturing roles, even if they started out the same as men, many women dont have the capability any more to be ok with killing Apr 15, 2007 5:22:58 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah true Apr 15, 2007 5:23:20 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: not necessarily. i think that the ability to kill is something you can lose, per se; it's probably more instinctual Apr 15, 2007 5:23:22 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: *can't Apr 15, 2007 5:23:28 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well, we have evolved over the years Apr 15, 2007 5:23:37 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: gaining some skills and losing others Apr 15, 2007 5:23:54 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: so i dont know Apr 15, 2007 5:23:59 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right, but a person's reactions depend on their environment; male soldiers kill b/c that's the environment they're placed in Apr 15, 2007 5:24:20 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yes Apr 15, 2007 5:24:36 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: they have to in order to survive, theoretically Apr 15, 2007 5:24:38 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but most of them are able to reconcile it because they feel its their duty and they did a good thing Apr 15, 2007 5:24:54 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: so if you placed a woman in the same situation, there's nothing to say she wouldn't do the exact same thing Apr 15, 2007 5:24:59 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: are women able to accept it in the same way? Apr 15, 2007 5:25:22 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: never having killed anyone.... i woulodn't know Apr 15, 2007 5:25:32 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: wouldn't* Apr 15, 2007 5:25:40 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i dont know, i mean it is instinct to save yourself but im not sure women have the same instinct as men in that way Apr 15, 2007 5:25:46 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i'm not saying they do, but i don't think we're able to say that they don't, either Apr 15, 2007 5:26:09 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i dont think we can say they do or they dont but i think if they did there would be a lot more women soldiers now Apr 15, 2007 5:26:52 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think womens instinct lies more in going and getting the man to protect them rather than fighting themselves Apr 15, 2007 5:26:57 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but i cant make a generality for everyone at all Apr 15, 2007 5:27:14 PM EDT
CMC dah88: ahaha thats a stereotype Apr 15, 2007 5:27:14 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i mean i agree Apr 15, 2007 5:27:16 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: hahaha i know Apr 15, 2007 5:27:19 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but thats kind of the problem Apr 15, 2007 5:27:24 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i know it, but hey, thats the way i think! Apr 15, 2007 5:27:30 PM EDT
CMC dah88: women dont want that view of them Apr 15, 2007 5:27:31 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: women stereotype themselves Apr 15, 2007 5:27:36 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha Apr 15, 2007 5:27:40 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i think that the fact that their haven't been many women soldiers before is at least as large a mitigating factor Apr 15, 2007 5:27:41 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah its true Apr 15, 2007 5:27:41 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but yeah, but if we continue to look at it that way, then they'll never be treated equally Apr 15, 2007 5:28:02 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right Apr 15, 2007 5:28:20 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but getting back to the main point, i dont know that they can be treated equally Apr 15, 2007 5:28:22 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i think that depends on what we mean by equal, though Apr 15, 2007 5:28:38 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: then what needs to change the most is the way women view themselves Apr 15, 2007 5:28:50 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think Apr 15, 2007 5:28:54 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: at least Apr 15, 2007 5:28:57 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i mean women complain that they want to be equal to men, but every female in here and most you would ask would agree that they wouldnt want to be drafted Apr 15, 2007 5:28:58 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: right Apr 15, 2007 5:29:10 PM EDT
CMC dah88: you cant have it both ways Apr 15, 2007 5:29:17 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: we want all the good things that men have and none of the bad Apr 15, 2007 5:29:20 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha Apr 15, 2007 5:29:21 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:29:23 PM EDT
CMC dah88: ahaha, exactly Apr 15, 2007 5:29:26 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right, but does the idea of "equality" have to be profession-specific? Apr 15, 2007 5:29:37 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: what you're talking about is a complete 50/50 split of the work force. that's a very literal form of equality Apr 15, 2007 5:30:04 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah i mean women have come a llong way Apr 15, 2007 5:30:18 PM EDT
CMC dah88: professionally Apr 15, 2007 5:30:20 PM EDT
CMC dah88: there are just as many women CEOs as men these days Apr 15, 2007 5:30:35 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think that they will definitely be treated equally in daily life, etc., but in different areas they'll never be Apr 15, 2007 5:30:46 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: not in the fortune 500, there aren't, i don't think Apr 15, 2007 5:30:49 PM EDT
CMC dah88: and some jobs are going to be sterotyped, but it goes both ways Apr 15, 2007 5:30:50 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: daily life including things such as jobs, etc. like the CEO bit you were talking about right then Apr 15, 2007 5:31:01 PM EDT
CMC dah88: well the fact that there are any in fortune 500 is saying something, but even small companies Apr 15, 2007 5:31:17 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i just think there is less of a "glass ceiling" now Apr 15, 2007 5:31:25 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: especially since CEO positions don't need muscle Apr 15, 2007 5:31:34 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:31:41 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yes, but there's still the problem of what we mean when we say "equality". Apr 15, 2007 5:31:56 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: there is way less opposition to women advancing Apr 15, 2007 5:32:07 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah def Apr 15, 2007 5:32:13 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, totally Apr 15, 2007 5:32:21 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: it just means there shouldnt be any barriers Apr 15, 2007 5:32:30 PM EDT
CMC dah88: women can be just as smart as men, which is the equality they were looking for for a long time Apr 15, 2007 5:32:33 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:32:51 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right, but what does "no barriers" mean in the drafting example, for instance? Apr 15, 2007 5:33:00 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i dont know what that means Apr 15, 2007 5:33:19 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think it means that everyone, including all females able, will go in for the draft Apr 15, 2007 5:33:19 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: right Apr 15, 2007 5:33:26 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but like we said earlier, only the ones able will go on Apr 15, 2007 5:33:32 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but they should also have the same opportunity to climb ranks in the army as men Apr 15, 2007 5:33:48 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: like the girls that can't do a pushup won't...but it's also the same way for guys Apr 15, 2007 5:34:01 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i guess thats mostly what people think of in equality Apr 15, 2007 5:34:07 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:34:15 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: it all goes back to stereotypes in reality Apr 15, 2007 5:34:24 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: they should be judged by the same standards Apr 15, 2007 5:34:26 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: men are more intimidating than women, which is also why you see them in these high ranking positions everywhere Apr 15, 2007 5:34:39 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah because even if they did get drafted a lot less women than men would be qualified i would imagine Apr 15, 2007 5:34:42 PM EDT
CMC dah88: like with the push-up thing you just said Apr 15, 2007 5:34:49 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, and even though some men can't do the pushups, more men than women can Apr 15, 2007 5:35:14 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and ambitious in general Apr 15, 2007 5:35:18 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: men are* Apr 15, 2007 5:35:32 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i just think women will never be physically equal to men so whether theyre drafted or not doesnt nescessarily mean that theyre equal Apr 15, 2007 5:35:35 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: more* Apr 15, 2007 5:35:37 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well i think now a days women are also just about, if not equal to men in ambition Apr 15, 2007 5:35:43 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah definitely Apr 15, 2007 5:35:55 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: true Apr 15, 2007 5:36:09 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but it doesnt matter how much ambition you have, a lot of women just cant do 50 pushups Apr 15, 2007 5:36:17 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: ahhhhh another stereotype Apr 15, 2007 5:36:17 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: this sucks Apr 15, 2007 5:36:21 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well a lot of women can Apr 15, 2007 5:36:34 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: hell, i can't do 50 pushups Apr 15, 2007 5:36:36 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Apr 15, 2007 5:36:37 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: on the flipside Apr 15, 2007 5:36:38 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: lol Apr 15, 2007 5:36:40 PM EDT
CMC dah88: ahaha Apr 15, 2007 5:36:40 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean damn, im a stringbean Apr 15, 2007 5:36:47 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i think "equality" is a much-abused term...in application it's rather messy. if women are equal, than to what extent is society obliged to mandate and monitor that equality? Apr 15, 2007 5:36:56 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: (like preferential treatments, for example) Apr 15, 2007 5:37:16 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: women should be equal to men in the same way that races are equal Apr 15, 2007 5:37:30 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: like affirmative action? Apr 15, 2007 5:37:42 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well.... Apr 15, 2007 5:37:46 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: races are "equal," but they're not actually equal Apr 15, 2007 5:37:59 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: you know what i mean? Apr 15, 2007 5:38:02 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i just think there are a lot of instances when women cant do the same things men can, and also a lot of them where men cant do what women can Apr 15, 2007 5:38:14 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but the laws and protection trying to make that happen should be the same Apr 15, 2007 5:38:14 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well that will just sort itself out on its own Apr 15, 2007 5:38:33 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: its not like there wouldbe laws forcing a certain number of women to go into construction or the military Apr 15, 2007 5:38:59 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: its just that the women who choose that should be respected Apr 15, 2007 5:39:13 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:39:17 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well i think they already are respected just as much if they're in the military Apr 15, 2007 5:39:50 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think it should be their choice, no one is stopping women from being in the army, but that doesnt mean it should be drafted. its the same for men, no one is stopping men from being stay at home dads, but that doesnt mean all of them are cut out for it Apr 15, 2007 5:40:06 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean, yeah, their physical tests are easier, but that's just allowing nature to take its course since women "cant do those 50 pushups" Apr 15, 2007 5:40:20 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i just think as long as nothing is STOPPING women from being equal, for example they can enlist or become construction workers if they want to Apr 15, 2007 5:41:14 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: hey, i vote that the draft not be reinstated at all, for anyone lol Apr 15, 2007 5:41:24 PM EDT
CMC dah88: then weve come a long way Apr 15, 2007 5:41:27 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: right Apr 15, 2007 5:41:31 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and that they can move up the ladder from construction worker to supervisor or whatever if they have the ability Apr 15, 2007 5:42:01 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah, i think equality should be based on ability Apr 15, 2007 5:42:17 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think thats all we could really ask for Apr 15, 2007 5:42:20 PM EDT
CMC dah88: men and women are different, theres no way to change that Apr 15, 2007 5:42:32 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: definitely a woman shouldnt be given a job over a man with more skill just to aid "equality" Apr 15, 2007 5:42:45 PM EDT
CMC dah88: no, def not Apr 15, 2007 5:42:55 PM EDT
CMC dah88: if a man and a woman are both cut out for a job, thats where equality should come in Apr 15, 2007 5:43:20 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: okay, but play devil's advocate a minute: don't past and some current social attitudes toward the role of women in the workplace and at home place them at a disadvantage when it comes to their careers and other things? and should people be required to redress that? Apr 15, 2007 5:43:37 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, ability should determine the equality, i mean, we obviously shouldn't look down upon people who can't do as much as others, but yeah, i agree in the workplace that people should only advance if they well deserve it Apr 15, 2007 5:43:38 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: frogger, you mean like sitcoms? Apr 15, 2007 5:44:24 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i dont get it... Apr 15, 2007 5:44:51 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: wait, which part? Apr 15, 2007 5:45:07 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah me either Apr 15, 2007 5:45:15 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: if you mean like sitcoms, then yeah, it does put them to a disadvantage Apr 15, 2007 5:45:18 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but on the other hand, it is our natural course, of say like how women are more nurturing Apr 15, 2007 5:45:36 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: for some reason, i'm thinking of Home Improvement right now Apr 15, 2007 5:45:47 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: partially. i was talking more generally than just tv, though Apr 15, 2007 5:45:50 PM EDT
CMC dah88: well women are stereotyped in sitcoms but so are men Apr 15, 2007 5:45:53 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: let's compare that to Full House Apr 15, 2007 5:45:53 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think those are two good things to compare Apr 15, 2007 5:46:08 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:46:27 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: for instance, tim allen works with tools while whoever his wife is is more of the nurturing character Apr 15, 2007 5:46:30 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: right.... Apr 15, 2007 5:46:36 PM EDT
CMC dah88: and full house Apr 15, 2007 5:46:37 PM EDT
CMC dah88: hes a stay at home dad Apr 15, 2007 5:46:40 PM EDT
CMC dah88: or well, hes a full time dad Apr 15, 2007 5:46:46 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: there's lots of variety in sitcoms Apr 15, 2007 5:46:54 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but then look at bob saggot in full house of how he's very feminine and cleans and vaccuums, but on the other hand, he can't play sports or do physical labor worth crap Apr 15, 2007 5:47:01 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha thats trueee.... Apr 15, 2007 5:47:17 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but in sitcoms the natural tendency is like home improvement Apr 15, 2007 5:47:20 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: so they made him womanly? Apr 15, 2007 5:47:24 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right, i wouldn't say bob sagget's character is the norm Apr 15, 2007 5:47:40 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah and there are plenty of sitcoms that protray men as sloppy beer drinking sport fans Apr 15, 2007 5:47:45 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but that doesnt play a role in their applying for work Apr 15, 2007 5:48:02 PM EDT
CMC dah88: so it shouldnt for women either Apr 15, 2007 5:48:06 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: oh oh! Apr 15, 2007 5:48:07 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: what about king of queens? Apr 15, 2007 5:48:12 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i've only watched like 2 episodes Apr 15, 2007 5:48:25 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: she has a higher paying, white collar job Apr 15, 2007 5:48:26 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah that makes sense Apr 15, 2007 5:48:37 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and her husband's a truck driver Apr 15, 2007 5:48:43 PM EDT
CMC dah88: even shows like sex and the city, where women are independently successful Apr 15, 2007 5:48:52 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that's society turning things around, showing that, since it's more of a recent show, how views have been, and are continuing to change Apr 15, 2007 5:49:03 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: exactly Apr 15, 2007 5:49:09 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and that helps things change Apr 15, 2007 5:49:17 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah so i dont think sitcoms really affect anything Apr 15, 2007 5:49:17 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: because the more people see it, the more they get used to it Apr 15, 2007 5:49:26 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think they affect the way people think Apr 15, 2007 5:49:34 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right, but which attitudes do you think are most prevalent? Apr 15, 2007 5:49:46 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think they do though- because of what little....just said, and it portrays the views of society quite well Apr 15, 2007 5:49:48 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but i think there's a trend that they're affecting it in a good way Apr 15, 2007 5:49:50 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i agree Apr 15, 2007 5:50:01 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:50:04 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:50:05 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think they change with society Apr 15, 2007 5:50:12 PM EDT
CMC dah88: which is important Apr 15, 2007 5:50:15 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i mean, a blatantly racist, sexist sitcom would never get on the air today Apr 15, 2007 5:50:20 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:50:26 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah, def Apr 15, 2007 5:50:29 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (dave chapelle....) Apr 15, 2007 5:50:37 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: welllllll... Apr 15, 2007 5:50:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Apr 15, 2007 5:50:50 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: lol Apr 15, 2007 5:50:52 PM EDT
CMC dah88: ahah Apr 15, 2007 5:50:53 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: ok fine Apr 15, 2007 5:50:54 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: sorry, i had to Apr 15, 2007 5:51:03 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but they just kicked some radio show host off the air for a sexist, racist remark Apr 15, 2007 5:51:10 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i was just going to say that Apr 15, 2007 5:51:16 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:51:19 PM EDT
CMC dah88: imus Apr 15, 2007 5:51:20 PM EDT
CMC dah88: don imus or soemthing Apr 15, 2007 5:51:25 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha so i wonder why its fine in some settings and not in others? Apr 15, 2007 5:51:32 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right, but chapelle is doing something different; he reduces racist attitudes to absurdity, and makes them look ridiculous Apr 15, 2007 5:51:39 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: true Apr 15, 2007 5:51:46 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: its a parody Apr 15, 2007 5:51:48 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: same thing with the office Apr 15, 2007 5:51:52 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: this guy totally meant it Apr 15, 2007 5:51:53 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: same thing with borat, to a certain extent Apr 15, 2007 5:51:58 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah and thats not really the same kind of show as like full house or home improvement Apr 15, 2007 5:51:59 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well, not that he meant it, but that's how he talks Apr 15, 2007 5:52:02 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:52:04 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: he's a southern man Apr 15, 2007 5:52:05 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: brought up through the south in the 60's and 70's Apr 15, 2007 5:52:16 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: isn't he buds with howard stern, or no? Apr 15, 2007 5:52:28 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: wow lol Apr 15, 2007 5:52:32 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: that doesnt add to his credibility Apr 15, 2007 5:52:38 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: because the south mixed with stern......= that comment Apr 15, 2007 5:52:39 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:52:59 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: he's kind of a blowhard Apr 15, 2007 5:53:18 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i'm not saying it's right, i'm just saying that there are still people like that and inequalities in that sense does still exist for reasons such as that Apr 15, 2007 5:53:54 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think in a few generations it will be in textbooks though Apr 15, 2007 5:54:09 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well its already harder to listen to howard stern Apr 15, 2007 5:54:33 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah, same Apr 15, 2007 5:54:36 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:54:49 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean, look at how one/two generations has changed views on Race AND Gender Apr 15, 2007 5:54:57 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:55:19 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: absolutely Apr 15, 2007 5:55:37 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: these things do take time Apr 15, 2007 5:55:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, nothing this big and this imbedded in even our culture will change over night Apr 15, 2007 5:56:03 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but i do see a promising future Apr 15, 2007 5:56:17 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yayyy Apr 15, 2007 5:56:29 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah thats always good news Apr 15, 2007 5:56:40 PM EDT

CMC frogger428: indeed Apr 15, 2007 5:57:02 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: wow, what an uplifting end Apr 15, 2007 5:57:21 PM EDT
CMC dah88: ahah Apr 15, 2007 5:57:26 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha Apr 15, 2007 5:57:27 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: oh the future is so bright for humanity... Apr 15, 2007 5:57:37 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but look at the nations reaction to imus' comment Apr 15, 2007 5:57:46 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: it was an absolute outrage Apr 15, 2007 5:57:56 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah that alone shows weve come a long way Apr 15, 2007 5:58:15 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: true that Apr 15, 2007 5:58:25 PM EDT
CMC dah88: for people to be outraged about something he said about a womens college basketball team Apr 15, 2007 5:58:28 PM EDT
CMC dah88: and for him to be fired fori t Apr 15, 2007 5:58:38 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that just tells you that so many people are willing to have and implement change, and even looking at the students accepting the apology, it shows that both "sides" are willing to cooperate through this in the future Apr 15, 2007 5:58:54 PM EDT
CMC dah88: it just shows people are standing up for themselves Apr 15, 2007 5:58:55 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Apr 15, 2007 5:59:18 PM EDT
CMC dah88: and thats important if we want change Apr 15, 2007 5:59:25 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: which also shows that they are "gaining power" towards "equality"...for whatever it stands as Apr 15, 2007 5:59:36 PM EDT
CMC dah88: not letting things like that be overlooked Apr 15, 2007 5:59:37 PM EDT
CMC dah88: exactly Apr 15, 2007 5:59:44 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: woop woop! Apr 15, 2007 5:59:49 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and higher authorities like nbc and the govt are helping, not protecting those who wtill discriminate Apr 15, 2007 5:59:51 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yayyy equality Apr 15, 2007 6:00:05 PM EDT
CMC dah88: haha Apr 15, 2007 6:00:09 PM EDT
