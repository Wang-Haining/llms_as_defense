Melissa Carbone: yes Apr 24, 2007 8:06:35 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: that reminds me, I need a sheet saying that I was in the study and what it entailed, can I get that from you Apr 24, 2007 8:06:49 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: i think you should probably go to dr dabin for that Apr 24, 2007 8:07:24 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: oK Apr 24, 2007 8:07:27 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: sabin Apr 24, 2007 8:07:28 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: ok so, your first topic is the legalization of marijuana Apr 24, 2007 8:07:44 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: so, who wants it legal? Apr 24, 2007 8:07:58 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: does everyone agree or disagree? Apr 24, 2007 8:07:58 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i agree with the legalization of marijuana Apr 24, 2007 8:08:07 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: I don't see a reason to keep it illegal, so yeah, i agree Apr 24, 2007 8:08:12 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but if we were to legalize it all of a sudden Apr 24, 2007 8:08:28 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i guess i will go along with the group bc i dont really care Apr 24, 2007 8:08:34 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: do you really think anyone would be able to use it with any type of moderation? Apr 24, 2007 8:08:41 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: I dont think you're giving people enough credit Apr 24, 2007 8:08:44 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: I think they would Apr 24, 2007 8:08:46 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: sure youll have your share of big potheads, but then again, theres also a nice handful of alcoholics Apr 24, 2007 8:09:09 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i don tthink everyone would abuse it Apr 24, 2007 8:09:26 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: me neither Apr 24, 2007 8:09:31 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: right now it is very expensive and difficult to obtain, and people still experience lifestyle problems because they smoke too much Apr 24, 2007 8:09:33 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i know some of my friends parents will smoke casually Apr 24, 2007 8:09:38 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: imagine if you could buy it at a gas station Apr 24, 2007 8:09:46 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: Its easier to obtain for some people than alcohol Apr 24, 2007 8:09:47 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: it's not really all that hard to get Apr 24, 2007 8:09:54 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but its more difficult than it would be were it legalized Apr 24, 2007 8:10:06 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: just because they legalize it doesnt mean they have to sell it at gas stations Apr 24, 2007 8:10:09 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: and people experience lifestyle problems, MAJOR ones from alcohol Apr 24, 2007 8:10:14 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: yes they do Apr 24, 2007 8:10:19 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: dont you think that effect would carry over Apr 24, 2007 8:10:24 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: there could be an age restiction like in denver Apr 24, 2007 8:10:25 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: of course, but thats aNYTHING , anything out of moderation is bad Apr 24, 2007 8:10:38 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and also just like state stores they could have places where you could legally buy it if you were of age Apr 24, 2007 8:10:50 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: and I think people have enough restraint that for the majority it's not going to be a problem Apr 24, 2007 8:10:58 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: sure there would be kids having it bought for them, but come on, you go to loyola, think about the parallels to alcohol in that case Apr 24, 2007 8:11:16 PM EDT
CMC blue322: wait wait im lost Apr 24, 2007 8:11:30 PM EDT
CMC blue322: what are we arguing? Apr 24, 2007 8:11:35 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: lifestyle problems caused by smoking too much Apr 24, 2007 8:11:53 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i think its become a "is pot really any different than alcohol" Apr 24, 2007 8:12:05 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: because of its easily attainable nature with legalization Apr 24, 2007 8:12:05 PM EDT
CMC blue322: what lifestyle problems come from smoking? Apr 24, 2007 8:12:16 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i actually think that if you legalized it though it would become harder to obtain Apr 24, 2007 8:12:25 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: I also dont think everyone will just start smoking, i mean not everyone drinks, albiet many people do but still Apr 24, 2007 8:12:30 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: because there would be fewer underground sources Apr 24, 2007 8:12:33 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: for some people, pot kills motivation because it is so satisfying Apr 24, 2007 8:12:55 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: for SOME people Apr 24, 2007 8:13:05 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: exactly only for some Apr 24, 2007 8:13:12 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: for others its a recreational drug Apr 24, 2007 8:13:14 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: and for some people its the same with alcohol Apr 24, 2007 8:13:15 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: to be used on occasion Apr 24, 2007 8:13:21 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: one of my friends roommates smokes pot and i dont see any problems with him Apr 24, 2007 8:14:00 PM EDT
CMC blue322: how often? Apr 24, 2007 8:14:08 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: he smokes a lot of it Apr 24, 2007 8:14:10 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: hes in a couple of my classes Apr 24, 2007 8:14:16 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: yet he gets amazing grades Apr 24, 2007 8:14:22 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i have heard some people say that it kills brain cells Apr 24, 2007 8:14:26 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: impossible Apr 24, 2007 8:14:30 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: if anything he has a bigger problem with world of warcraft than pot Apr 24, 2007 8:14:30 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: so does alcohol Apr 24, 2007 8:14:33 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: HAHHAAAHA Apr 24, 2007 8:14:36 PM EDT
CMC blue322: kill brain cells? Apr 24, 2007 8:14:39 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: alcohol kills MAJOR brain cells Apr 24, 2007 8:14:41 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: yes Apr 24, 2007 8:14:41 PM EDT
CMC blue322: really Apr 24, 2007 8:14:45 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i didnt know that Apr 24, 2007 8:14:49 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: yeah, it does Apr 24, 2007 8:14:52 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: world of warcraft plus marijuana equals lives ended Apr 24, 2007 8:14:53 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: pot doesnt exactly kill braincells Apr 24, 2007 8:14:56 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its just the fact that youre holding smoke in your lungs that does it Apr 24, 2007 8:15:06 PM EDT
CMC blue322: do u guys know how alcohol exactly kills brain cells Apr 24, 2007 8:15:11 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: respiratory effects Apr 24, 2007 8:15:12 PM EDT
CMC blue322: is it permanent Apr 24, 2007 8:15:16 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: yes brain cells dont regenerate Apr 24, 2007 8:15:26 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: once theyre dead theyre gone Apr 24, 2007 8:15:32 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i read a study, i cant prove its credibility but i know more is being looked into that shows that pot can actually stimulate braincell growth Apr 24, 2007 8:15:32 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: in a good way Apr 24, 2007 8:15:34 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i dont know if i believe that Apr 24, 2007 8:15:45 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: im not saying you should Apr 24, 2007 8:15:52 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but its interesting to see that come out as a result from one study Apr 24, 2007 8:16:00 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and there has not been one known case of lung cancer caused by marijuana smoke Apr 24, 2007 8:16:12 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: not saying it does no damage Apr 24, 2007 8:16:21 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but its not as severe as cigarette smoke Apr 24, 2007 8:16:30 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: but still, theres no reason for it to be illegal when we have things like cigarettes and alcohol Apr 24, 2007 8:16:38 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: fewer chemicals Apr 24, 2007 8:16:38 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i agree Apr 24, 2007 8:16:50 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: has everybody here heard the term "blunt ride" Apr 24, 2007 8:17:09 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but our marijuana prohibition is a moral crusade left over from the early 20th century Apr 24, 2007 8:17:18 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: what is that Apr 24, 2007 8:17:21 PM EDT
CMC blue322: no i have not Apr 24, 2007 8:17:21 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its when a group of kids will get together and roll a marijuana cigar/cigarette and ride in a car and smoke it Apr 24, 2007 8:17:38 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: now, how many fatal accidents have you heard caused by a blunt ride Apr 24, 2007 8:17:48 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: now lets make that a "vodka sprite ride" Apr 24, 2007 8:18:00 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: whole different story Apr 24, 2007 8:18:08 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i have never heard of that either haha Apr 24, 2007 8:18:10 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: well i made that one up Apr 24, 2007 8:18:16 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but it goes to show that the effects of marijuana arent as detremental as those of alcohol in terms of the "mess you up" sense Apr 24, 2007 8:18:37 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i think what the marijuana debate comes down to Apr 24, 2007 8:18:57 PM EDT
CMC blue322: people just abuse alcohol Apr 24, 2007 8:19:04 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: is: is illegality sufficient for immorality Apr 24, 2007 8:19:06 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: immoral? Apr 24, 2007 8:19:18 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: is everything thats illegal necessarily wrong, does the legislature have the power over YOUR life to make YOUR decisions about morality Apr 24, 2007 8:19:27 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: we resign that power to them as citizens... but what happens if someone disagrees with the reasoning behind a lwe Apr 24, 2007 8:19:46 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: *law Apr 24, 2007 8:19:50 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: revolution! Apr 24, 2007 8:20:05 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i think that the whole issue of its morality will slowly fade Apr 24, 2007 8:20:56 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: especially with a generation as tolerant as ours taking over soon Apr 24, 2007 8:21:12 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: well in like 20-30 years our college buddies now will be in congress and on capital hill Apr 24, 2007 8:21:25 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: then what Apr 24, 2007 8:21:43 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: while the introduction of marijuana into our economy wont be a speedy one, as we can already see by denvers example that it will happen Apr 24, 2007 8:21:47 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i dont agree Apr 24, 2007 8:22:00 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i dont think it will become legalized Apr 24, 2007 8:22:06 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: But how is marijuana smoking immoral? Apr 24, 2007 8:22:08 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: im not talking about within the next 2 years blue, im talking over a couple decades Apr 24, 2007 8:22:29 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: well the government says it is Apr 24, 2007 8:22:31 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: immoral Apr 24, 2007 8:22:33 PM EDT
CMC blue322: oh oh ok Apr 24, 2007 8:22:36 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: This is all of a sudden making me feel like Im watching reefer madness Apr 24, 2007 8:22:37 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: propoganda film Apr 24, 2007 8:22:43 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: so my Q was is that sufficient for it actually BEING immoral Apr 24, 2007 8:22:46 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i have seen reefer madness Apr 24, 2007 8:22:49 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i meant the original not the musicak Apr 24, 2007 8:23:01 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: its a musical? Apr 24, 2007 8:23:10 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: tehy made a musical yeah Apr 24, 2007 8:23:17 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: refer madness was a joke Apr 24, 2007 8:23:17 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: no the original reefer madness was not a joke Apr 24, 2007 8:23:27 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: it was made as a film titled "Warn your children" Apr 24, 2007 8:23:40 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: ive seen it Apr 24, 2007 8:23:50 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: that was shown at PTA meetings, and city halls Apr 24, 2007 8:23:52 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i mean joke in the sense that it was horribly inaccurate Apr 24, 2007 8:24:12 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: Yet people STILL say marijuana is immoral Apr 24, 2007 8:24:29 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: and people believed it then Apr 24, 2007 8:24:39 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: and some believe it now Apr 24, 2007 8:24:41 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: many i would think still believe it now Apr 24, 2007 8:24:51 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and those were the same people who fell into this propaganda trap Apr 24, 2007 8:25:00 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: what i want to know is How is marijana immoral Apr 24, 2007 8:25:04 PM EDT
CMC blue322: yeah i dont get that Apr 24, 2007 8:25:24 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: well according to refer madness and some of these politicians today it causes you to become an insane murderer Apr 24, 2007 8:25:29 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: and im sorry the government saying it isnt enough Apr 24, 2007 8:25:31 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: or a huge sex fiend Apr 24, 2007 8:25:39 PM EDT
CMC blue322: were there any cases that proved marijuana made u a killer Apr 24, 2007 8:25:51 PM EDT
CMC blue322: or sex fiend Apr 24, 2007 8:25:57 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: no Apr 24, 2007 8:26:00 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: nope Apr 24, 2007 8:26:03 PM EDT
CMC blue322: bc i feel like alcohol makes u do worse things Apr 24, 2007 8:26:09 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: none and there is pleanty of evidence against it Apr 24, 2007 8:26:13 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: LOCOLADY - marijuana is illegal on the grounds that lots of people say it is, including the government Apr 24, 2007 8:26:21 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: maybe not written down, but im sure you all have seen movies such as dazed and confused Apr 24, 2007 8:26:26 PM EDT
CMC blue322: yes Apr 24, 2007 8:26:38 PM EDT
CMC blue322: good movie Apr 24, 2007 8:26:41 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but deciding for yourself is immoral, as using marijuana is apparently a big problem Apr 24, 2007 8:26:42 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: Im not sure that made sense Apr 24, 2007 8:27:08 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its sad that they dont recognize that marijuana isn't nearly as big of a problem as alcohol Apr 24, 2007 8:27:12 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i think there is NO reason for marijuana to remain illegal while alcohol is legal Apr 24, 2007 8:27:36 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: thats what it boils down to Apr 24, 2007 8:27:42 PM EDT
CMC blue322: was marijuana ever legal? Apr 24, 2007 8:27:59 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: they're about the same, harm-wise Apr 24, 2007 8:28:01 PM EDT
CMC blue322: if so when did ut become illegal Apr 24, 2007 8:28:10 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: george washington had hemp fields Apr 24, 2007 8:28:13 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: sure it is a useful material for clothing, but try telling that one to your narcotics officer Apr 24, 2007 8:28:44 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: if they found a hemp field in your backyard today youd be behind bars for the rest of your life Apr 24, 2007 8:29:15 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: yes but he didnt grow it for shmokin Apr 24, 2007 8:29:37 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: we actually dont know that Apr 24, 2007 8:29:47 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: he grew it because hemp is a strong/valuable fiber Apr 24, 2007 8:29:51 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: he had been using some growing techniques that only aid with the THC content Apr 24, 2007 8:29:52 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: according to whom Apr 24, 2007 8:29:59 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: now why would he do that otherwise? Apr 24, 2007 8:30:01 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: according to whom Apr 24, 2007 8:30:09 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: several websites that ive attempted to research this at Apr 24, 2007 8:30:12 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but thats besides the point Apr 24, 2007 8:30:19 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: im making a point that it was legal to grow it at one point Apr 24, 2007 8:30:29 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: just to answer the question if it ever was legal Apr 24, 2007 8:30:56 PM EDT
CMC blue322: thank you Apr 24, 2007 8:31:26 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: alright sooooo....\ Apr 24, 2007 8:32:19 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i stand behind my opinion Apr 24, 2007 8:32:43 PM EDT
CMC blue322: which is? Apr 24, 2007 8:32:51 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: there is no basis for the continuing status of illegality Apr 24, 2007 8:33:12 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i could say "taxation" Apr 24, 2007 8:33:29 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: heh Apr 24, 2007 8:34:09 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: thats what many government guys would give as a reason to oppose legalization Apr 24, 2007 8:34:11 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: do you guys feel that the effects are similar enough to alcohol that it should be legalized? Apr 24, 2007 8:34:17 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but i dont think it would be that bad Apr 24, 2007 8:34:21 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: yes i do melissa Apr 24, 2007 8:34:36 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i think the effects of alcohol are worse Apr 24, 2007 8:34:58 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: the effects of marijuana can be more or less severe than alcohol, depending on the user Apr 24, 2007 8:35:00 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i wouldnt say similar, but id say they are on a much lower scale of "screwed you up" Apr 24, 2007 8:35:01 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and depending on the intake Apr 24, 2007 8:35:10 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but youll never get THC poisoning Apr 24, 2007 8:35:14 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: I think that its similar enough that having one legal and one illegal causes a mockery of our legal system Apr 24, 2007 8:35:17 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: unless you smoke i think it is 2lbs or something Apr 24, 2007 8:35:20 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but by that point youll probably have been knocked out Apr 24, 2007 8:35:36 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: my friend's roomate was so drunk this weekend that he shit on the floor in a carpeted room Apr 24, 2007 8:36:04 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: lovely Apr 24, 2007 8:36:13 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: ive never heard about high people shitting on carpets Apr 24, 2007 8:36:19 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: alcohol poisoning poses an infinitely greater threat to a person than marijuana poisoning Apr 24, 2007 8:36:23 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: hahahahaha Apr 24, 2007 8:36:25 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: dear god, that made me laugh when i noticed it Apr 24, 2007 8:36:32 PM EDT

CMC LoCoLady: so do i Apr 24, 2007 8:37:27 PM EDT
CMC blue322: my roomate is high right now Apr 24, 2007 8:37:30 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: like my friends roommate who plays WOW Apr 24, 2007 8:37:31 PM EDT
CMC blue322: and she seems the same Apr 24, 2007 8:37:35 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: mine was high earlier too Apr 24, 2007 8:37:46 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and i didnt notice much of a difference Apr 24, 2007 8:37:51 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: other than the fact that he was hungrier Apr 24, 2007 8:37:55 PM EDT
CMC blue322: hahah very true Apr 24, 2007 8:38:02 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: why is that anyways Apr 24, 2007 8:38:06 PM EDT
CMC blue322: why is what Apr 24, 2007 8:38:12 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i dont know, i think it heightens senses or something Apr 24, 2007 8:38:19 PM EDT
CMC blue322: weed? Apr 24, 2007 8:38:28 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: making food taste amazing Apr 24, 2007 8:38:29 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: yeah Apr 24, 2007 8:38:30 PM EDT
CMC blue322: well after a night of drinking i love a slice of pizza Apr 24, 2007 8:38:46 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: it effects your brains perception of what is real, the levels of chemicals in the cerebellum trigger a hunger reflex Apr 24, 2007 8:38:47 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: people get the munchies when drunk too though Apr 24, 2007 8:38:48 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i heard it has something to do with metabolism Apr 24, 2007 8:38:51 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: as well as paranoia Apr 24, 2007 8:38:54 PM EDT
CMC blue322: and no matter where its from its good Apr 24, 2007 8:38:56 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but people when high dont throw it up 10 minutes later Apr 24, 2007 8:39:02 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i dont throw up my food Apr 24, 2007 8:39:09 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: well maybe not you Apr 24, 2007 8:39:14 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but ive known enough drunks that they do throw up their pizza valla 10 minutes after eating it Apr 24, 2007 8:39:27 PM EDT
CMC blue322: mmm pizza valla Apr 24, 2007 8:39:41 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: another advantage of marijuana over alcohol Apr 24, 2007 8:39:44 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: alcohol is a poison, marijuana just stimulates different parts of your brain Apr 24, 2007 8:39:57 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: okay so... Apr 24, 2007 8:41:21 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: that marijuana stuff... Apr 24, 2007 8:42:01 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: stunts your mental development Apr 24, 2007 8:42:29 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: so does alcohol, kills brain cells Apr 24, 2007 8:42:50 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: not really Apr 24, 2007 8:42:53 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: so which does everyone think is worse, alcohol or pot Apr 24, 2007 8:43:03 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: alcohol Apr 24, 2007 8:43:07 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: my roommate for one loves to smoke and do his reading for philosophy or politics Apr 24, 2007 8:43:09 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: alcohol Apr 24, 2007 8:43:17 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i think alcohol has more harmful effects then marijuana Apr 24, 2007 8:43:27 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: though i love it to death and will probably be visiting it at my friend murphs Apr 24, 2007 8:43:38 PM EDT
CMC blue322: but if marijuana were legalized do you think people would abuse the privilege Apr 24, 2007 8:43:41 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i doubt it Apr 24, 2007 8:43:50 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i think they probably would similarly to alcohol Apr 24, 2007 8:43:52 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: some people would, but most wouldnt Apr 24, 2007 8:43:57 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: Yeah some people would, just like anything else Apr 24, 2007 8:43:57 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: people cant even control thmselves now and its illegal Apr 24, 2007 8:43:58 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i think if we were ever going to "legalize", decriminalization would be a much better option Apr 24, 2007 8:44:12 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: after all, the prohibition of marijuana is OBSCENELY expensive Apr 24, 2007 8:44:24 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i think legalize with restrictions Apr 24, 2007 8:44:30 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: like i said, i think you dont give people enough credit GBD Apr 24, 2007 8:44:32 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: so is alcohol Apr 24, 2007 8:44:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: relatively speaking they're about the same price Apr 24, 2007 8:44:44 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: every posession charge is an arrest, ride in a popo car, booking, hearing, probation period, etc, and costs the state TONS of money Apr 24, 2007 8:44:48 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: is our moral crusade against pot worth all that? Apr 24, 2007 8:44:57 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: though i dont know from personal experience i know how much marijuana it takes to get "high" and i know the prices Apr 24, 2007 8:45:06 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i dont understand the moral part of it, there is nothing immoral about it Apr 24, 2007 8:46:30 PM EDT
CMC blue322: how much does it take to get high Apr 24, 2007 8:46:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: a couple of people can usually feel really good with a gram Apr 24, 2007 8:46:56 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: how much is that\ Apr 24, 2007 8:47:08 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: which from what ive heard costs around $20 Apr 24, 2007 8:47:10 PM EDT
CMC blue322: you seem to know your facts Apr 24, 2007 8:47:20 PM EDT
CMC blue322: so it costs $20 to get high Apr 24, 2007 8:47:31 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: ive researched from my roommate and others Apr 24, 2007 8:47:32 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: for a couple people Apr 24, 2007 8:47:36 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: a good amount less for 1 person Apr 24, 2007 8:47:49 PM EDT
CMC blue322: that seems reasonable Apr 24, 2007 8:47:52 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but compare that to a night at the bar and getting drunk Apr 24, 2007 8:47:55 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: or even a fifth of captain morgans Apr 24, 2007 8:48:11 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: which is usually very expensive Apr 24, 2007 8:48:13 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: a night in fells point can average between $40 to $60 Apr 24, 2007 8:48:36 PM EDT
CMC blue322: taxi rides Apr 24, 2007 8:48:37 PM EDT
CMC blue322: food Apr 24, 2007 8:48:39 PM EDT
CMC blue322: overpaying the taxi Apr 24, 2007 8:48:44 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and then having your wallet stolen from some random guy who jumps out of the bushes Apr 24, 2007 8:48:57 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: just kidding Apr 24, 2007 8:49:07 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: can we move on yet melissa? Apr 24, 2007 8:50:00 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: cause it seems we are pretty stagnant here Apr 24, 2007 8:50:10 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: did we all get 300? Apr 24, 2007 8:50:22 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: no we need at least an hour, but more so 300 words Apr 24, 2007 8:50:26 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: an hour per topic? Apr 24, 2007 8:50:35 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: lets shoot for 10 more min Apr 24, 2007 8:50:38 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: yes sir Apr 24, 2007 8:50:40 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: ok Apr 24, 2007 8:50:41 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: alright Apr 24, 2007 8:50:41 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: okay Apr 24, 2007 8:50:46 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: economically i think marijuana would be beneficial Apr 24, 2007 8:51:16 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: how so Apr 24, 2007 8:51:28 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: tax that shizzat and the government will be rollin' high stakes Apr 24, 2007 8:51:29 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but wouldnt it affect productivity Apr 24, 2007 8:51:41 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: are high people as productive as sober ones Apr 24, 2007 8:51:49 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: it would still be better than having a very large underground market for it Apr 24, 2007 8:52:03 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: depends on the person Apr 24, 2007 8:52:12 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i doubt drunk people are very productive Apr 24, 2007 8:52:21 PM EDT
CMC blue322: where does the money go to in these underground markets Apr 24, 2007 8:52:22 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: if anything they're more DESTRUCTIVE Apr 24, 2007 8:52:27 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: columbia Apr 24, 2007 8:52:33 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: no the coke money goes to columbia, or at least it did in the early 90s Apr 24, 2007 8:52:46 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: depends on who the "big dealer" is Apr 24, 2007 8:52:47 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and panama Apr 24, 2007 8:52:53 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: cokes still an underground market Apr 24, 2007 8:52:56 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: if you research you can usually find some of the big pot dealers Apr 24, 2007 8:53:21 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: ever seen blow? Apr 24, 2007 8:53:24 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: pot dealers who got caught* is what i meant Apr 24, 2007 8:53:41 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: people who have gardens of marijuana stashed in seceret caverns under their homes Apr 24, 2007 8:54:11 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: do you think a lot of people do Apr 24, 2007 8:54:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: one of them got busted thanks to a flux in the electric bill Apr 24, 2007 8:54:39 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i wouldnt say a lot, but enough to supply smaller dealers Apr 24, 2007 8:54:48 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and then so on Apr 24, 2007 8:54:51 PM EDT
CMC blue322: is weed legal outside of the us? Apr 24, 2007 8:54:59 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: moving down the ladder of dealers to the consumer Apr 24, 2007 8:55:00 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: in some parts of canada Apr 24, 2007 8:55:08 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: amsterdam Apr 24, 2007 8:55:09 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: in jamaica for rastafarians Apr 24, 2007 8:55:19 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: actually Apr 24, 2007 8:55:23 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: in amsterdam its now only legal if you've lived there for 2 years or more Apr 24, 2007 8:55:35 PM EDT
CMC blue322: why did they do that Apr 24, 2007 8:55:47 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: you sure? i havent heard of that Apr 24, 2007 8:56:09 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: because it was the only reason people were going there Apr 24, 2007 8:56:11 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: im sure Apr 24, 2007 8:56:12 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: You can't buy it Apr 24, 2007 8:56:20 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i think you can buy it anywhere Apr 24, 2007 8:56:29 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but you have to smoke it there Apr 24, 2007 8:56:34 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: in the cafes Apr 24, 2007 8:56:36 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: otherwise cannabis cup would be a big failure Apr 24, 2007 8:56:47 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: that attracts people from all over the world Apr 24, 2007 8:57:03 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: I'm not sure if you ,as a non resident, can smoke it anywhere Apr 24, 2007 8:57:09 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: its legal in the canary islands Apr 24, 2007 8:57:15 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: so is that it then? Apr 24, 2007 8:58:42 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i think there are a lot of countries in the world where it isnt legal per se, but the government doesn't have the luxury of a police force that can practically ban marijuana Apr 24, 2007 8:58:50 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: i see that Apr 24, 2007 8:59:36 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: heck, even in the U.S., it is only as illegal as people are receptive to the fact that they MIGHT get caught Apr 24, 2007 8:59:42 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: thats very true Apr 24, 2007 9:00:03 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: because our police, who work their ASSES off, can only catch a small percentage of people who actually smoke marijuana Apr 24, 2007 9:00:05 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: which leads to another question Apr 24, 2007 9:00:21 PM EDT
CMC blue322: which is Apr 24, 2007 9:00:38 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: would the billions spent of pot enforcement be better spent on murder, rape, and other violent crimes? Apr 24, 2007 9:00:41 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: our police force is stretched thin in spots as it is Apr 24, 2007 9:00:58 PM EDT
CMC blue322: is there a significant difference in the amount of time spent Apr 24, 2007 9:01:04 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: yes, absolutly Apr 24, 2007 9:01:06 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i think it would be better spent on other crimes Apr 24, 2007 9:01:34 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: EVERY person caught with weed is arrested, held, booked, released, has to attend multiple hearings, and usually, a supervised probation period Apr 24, 2007 9:01:40 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: the state has to pay the cops, the judges, the public defenders, prosecutors, probation officers, correctional officers, etc etc etc Apr 24, 2007 9:02:00 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: which is not only tedious but expensive Apr 24, 2007 9:02:02 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: and useless Apr 24, 2007 9:02:13 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: so should they prioritize elsewhere Apr 24, 2007 9:02:14 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i mean Apr 24, 2007 9:02:16 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i never thought about it that way Apr 24, 2007 9:02:20 PM EDT
CMC LoCoLady: because the majority of people will use again Apr 24, 2007 9:02:26 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: many suburban towns have TONS of money kicking around from property taxes Apr 24, 2007 9:02:29 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and they hire a huge police force Apr 24, 2007 9:02:37 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: it doesnt solve any problems, it just creates criminals Apr 24, 2007 9:02:37 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: which responds to legitimate problems, but also spends a ton of time chasing kids with pot Apr 24, 2007 9:02:53 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: police are supposed to protect, not harass Apr 24, 2007 9:03:17 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: down the road, there might be a violent crime going on in an urban area where the police almost ignore pot because they have bigger problems Apr 24, 2007 9:03:22 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: like a couple of kids seen in a smoke filled car Apr 24, 2007 9:03:41 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: the police on york road : they obviously care more about crack than underage drinking Apr 24, 2007 9:03:58 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: when barfights break out between 19 year olds at 2am, they dont do a thing to the bar owners Apr 24, 2007 9:04:17 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: haha seriously Apr 24, 2007 9:04:28 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: because in baltimore, alcohol control is practically a JOKE in the shadow of schedule 1 drug enforcement (crack, heroine, coke, etc) Apr 24, 2007 9:04:40 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i think they should focus more on those then alcohol Apr 24, 2007 9:04:59 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: we get enough? 9:05 Apr 24, 2007 9:05:33 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: absolutely Apr 24, 2007 9:05:36 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: ok lets move on Apr 24, 2007 9:05:41 PM EDT
