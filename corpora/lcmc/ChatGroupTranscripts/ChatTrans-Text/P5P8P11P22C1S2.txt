CMC ShoopDaWhoop: im not used to this lack of reading a long paragraph of rules and stuff Mar 18, 2007 1:01:50 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: i think to an extent it is Mar 18, 2007 1:02:19 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: okay well is there anywhere specific you see it? Mar 18, 2007 1:02:49 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i think it is still present especially in the job field Mar 18, 2007 1:03:13 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: i see it in gender roles..its expected that women stay home,. take care of the children, get them to school, etc. Mar 18, 2007 1:03:17 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i dont think its as prevalent a concern as racism Mar 18, 2007 1:03:22 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: and they can have a job Mar 18, 2007 1:03:24 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: most businesses are run by old white men Mar 18, 2007 1:03:27 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: but the distribution of responsibilities is so unfair Mar 18, 2007 1:03:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: typical image of the CEO Mar 18, 2007 1:03:36 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: well ever since betty friedan and what not, we have made progress Mar 18, 2007 1:03:43 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: from the traditional "nuclear family woman" to a more liberated one, which is good Mar 18, 2007 1:04:00 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: progress is being made but it still exists Mar 18, 2007 1:04:00 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: true there has been progress for women but its not there yet Mar 18, 2007 1:04:02 PM EDT
CMC blue322: what do you want it to be? Mar 18, 2007 1:04:48 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: can you clarify what "it" you're talking about? Mar 18, 2007 1:05:14 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: im sure everybody would say "equality" Mar 18, 2007 1:05:19 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: i think while in theory things are equal, in practice they are not Mar 18, 2007 1:05:20 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: women have stereotypical responsibilities as do men and i think that still needs to change Mar 18, 2007 1:05:35 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: what do you feel about commercials that portray the men going off to work and the women at home with their kids, do you think these play a part in gender discrimination? Mar 18, 2007 1:06:08 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: definitely Mar 18, 2007 1:06:24 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: possibly Mar 18, 2007 1:06:32 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: who would really say that they know a majority of men who stay at home? Mar 18, 2007 1:06:37 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: dont think ive seen one Mar 18, 2007 1:06:41 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: true women can work now Mar 18, 2007 1:06:55 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: they exist Mar 18, 2007 1:06:58 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: well if both parents work but they want to have kids Mar 18, 2007 1:07:10 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: but on top of their job, who has to make lunches for the kids? who has to make sure they have carpools to extra activities? Mar 18, 2007 1:07:15 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: then one of them necessarily has to stay home right Mar 18, 2007 1:07:21 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: not necessarily the woman Mar 18, 2007 1:07:25 PM EDT
CMC blue322: my dad has made me lunches Mar 18, 2007 1:07:29 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: even if it ends up that way Mar 18, 2007 1:07:32 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: my dad used to be the one who made my lunch Mar 18, 2007 1:07:39 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: but most of the time and stereotypically it is expected to be the woman Mar 18, 2007 1:07:39 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: on tv especially we are portraying this idea Mar 18, 2007 1:08:03 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i see more independent women on tv Mar 18, 2007 1:08:23 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i think the fact that our society picks up on that is progress in and of itself Mar 18, 2007 1:08:38 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: that is true Mar 18, 2007 1:08:49 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: people used to watch that stuff and think that it was typical Mar 18, 2007 1:08:50 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: and thats something that should continue to make progress Mar 18, 2007 1:08:57 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: what about certain jobs... do you think there is still gender discrimination in what jobs men should have vs what jobs women should have? are certain jobs still seen as jobs for women or men only? Mar 18, 2007 1:09:17 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: agreed Mar 18, 2007 1:09:18 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: they have to be Mar 18, 2007 1:09:47 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: yeah, they're mean Mar 18, 2007 1:09:50 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: there are fewer of them Mar 18, 2007 1:09:50 PM EDT
CMC blue322: ive never encountered a woman police officer Mar 18, 2007 1:10:05 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: really? they are mean! Mar 18, 2007 1:10:25 PM EDT
CMC blue322: did you get pulled over? Mar 18, 2007 1:10:33 PM EDT

CMC ShoopDaWhoop: be are be Mar 18, 2007 1:11:45 PM EDT
CMC blue322: so what is the consensus? do we think there is gender discrimination Mar 18, 2007 1:12:00 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: yes Mar 18, 2007 1:12:10 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: well Mar 18, 2007 1:12:10 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: what about discromonation against men? is there a problem with this aspect also? Mar 18, 2007 1:12:19 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i dont feel threatened by it Mar 18, 2007 1:12:19 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: we dont see active descrimination as much as we see the perpetuation of stereotypes Mar 18, 2007 1:12:24 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: there has been progress but it can continue Mar 18, 2007 1:12:26 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i agree with gobig Mar 18, 2007 1:12:38 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: turn on any tv channel, or look at any magazine, and you see hot chicks paraded like objects Mar 18, 2007 1:12:49 PM EDT
CMC blue322: you also see men Mar 18, 2007 1:12:58 PM EDT
CMC blue322: paraded like objects Mar 18, 2007 1:13:03 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but you dont see men mostly naked spreading their legs in a bikini with a "bang me" look on their face Mar 18, 2007 1:13:24 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i dont see that? Mar 18, 2007 1:13:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: bloody nose Mar 18, 2007 1:13:38 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i see it Mar 18, 2007 1:13:42 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: in every mens magazines, and TONS of womens ones too (especially teen ones) Mar 18, 2007 1:13:57 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: how many girly magazines have articles about crap like "how to please your man" Mar 18, 2007 1:14:20 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: well i dont think men feel the need to wear bikinis anyway Mar 18, 2007 1:14:20 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i do Mar 18, 2007 1:14:26 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: relativly speaking Mar 18, 2007 1:14:27 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: i agree Mar 18, 2007 1:14:34 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: im wearing one right now Mar 18, 2007 1:14:36 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: hey thats your deal Mar 18, 2007 1:14:42 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: women are objects to look at for so many men Mar 18, 2007 1:14:43 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: whatevers up to you Mar 18, 2007 1:14:45 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: and thats degrading Mar 18, 2007 1:14:49 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but all those magazines with "please your man" articles dont help the objectification Mar 18, 2007 1:14:51 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: they have an undertone of sexual subservience Mar 18, 2007 1:15:04 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: i also think there is incredible pressure for women to look a certain way Mar 18, 2007 1:15:09 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: a good way to stop it would be for women to stop conforming to these standards, refuse to pose in certain pictures Mar 18, 2007 1:15:28 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: but then what will they do? Mar 18, 2007 1:15:39 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: the problem is with stuff like even myspace, everybody wants to be a star Mar 18, 2007 1:15:42 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: media is partially to blame for the "look a certain way" thing, but girls still buy into it themselves Mar 18, 2007 1:15:55 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: exactly and society dictates women revealing themselves as the way to do it Mar 18, 2007 1:15:59 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: half of my female friends there have taken a "half nude" shot Mar 18, 2007 1:16:01 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but the thing is Mar 18, 2007 1:16:32 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: sex sells! Mar 18, 2007 1:16:35 PM EDT
CMC blue322: wait where have they taken a half nude shot? Mar 18, 2007 1:16:48 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: so for a magazine trying to make money at the expense of its readers intelligence, its a good marketing strategy Mar 18, 2007 1:16:52 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: myspace Mar 18, 2007 1:16:53 PM EDT
CMC blue322: oh Mar 18, 2007 1:16:59 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: awkward silence Mar 18, 2007 1:18:03 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: obviously Mar 18, 2007 1:19:00 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: yeah Mar 18, 2007 1:19:01 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: the man/woman paygap is still something like $1/.75 Mar 18, 2007 1:19:17 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: is this a major problem in society Mar 18, 2007 1:19:17 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i was paid more then the boys at my work bc my boss liked me Mar 18, 2007 1:19:18 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: traditional values, see women as less Mar 18, 2007 1:19:18 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: there's a pizza place by me that refuses to hire women... any feelings/thoughts? Mar 18, 2007 1:19:42 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i think its good women dont work there Mar 18, 2007 1:19:56 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: really? why? Mar 18, 2007 1:19:56 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i guess women in your town make bad pizza Mar 18, 2007 1:19:59 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: bad joke. Mar 18, 2007 1:20:05 PM EDT
CMC blue322: the pizza guys by me are creeps Mar 18, 2007 1:20:12 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: well what about title IX Mar 18, 2007 1:20:13 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: thats just absurd though Mar 18, 2007 1:20:13 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: good example of discrimination though, they arent allowed to work there on one hand, and even if they did they would get stared down everyday (by the creeps working) Mar 18, 2007 1:21:04 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: actually the guys that work there aren't creepy, they're really nice Mar 18, 2007 1:21:26 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: what about places like hooters Mar 18, 2007 1:21:40 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: dont even get me started Mar 18, 2007 1:21:52 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: guys should be allowed to work there as waiters Mar 18, 2007 1:21:54 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: hooters is a perfectly g-rated family restauraunt that discriminates against men! Mar 18, 2007 1:21:58 PM EDT
CMC blue322: HAHA Mar 18, 2007 1:21:59 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: please, get started, haha Mar 18, 2007 1:22:03 PM EDT

CMC ShoopDaWhoop: wings*( Mar 18, 2007 1:22:31 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: the place has a monstrous turnover rate though Mar 18, 2007 1:22:46 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: my brother goes to hooters with all his friends and they think its a big joke to joke with the women there and be rude Mar 18, 2007 1:22:50 PM EDT
CMC blue322: thats not nice Mar 18, 2007 1:23:00 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: those girls put up with so much shit Mar 18, 2007 1:23:01 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: but they make so much money Mar 18, 2007 1:23:08 PM EDT
CMC blue322: they are just trying to make money Mar 18, 2007 1:23:08 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: and most of them just need the money Mar 18, 2007 1:23:13 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: they need to stop applying at degrading restaurants Mar 18, 2007 1:23:19 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: its pretty shitty that they are ding that for cash tho Mar 18, 2007 1:23:22 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: thats like one step away from stripper Mar 18, 2007 1:23:28 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: but should they have to put up with men who go there, thinking its ok to be like that to them? Mar 18, 2007 1:23:34 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i dont think its just there Mar 18, 2007 1:23:49 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: no Mar 18, 2007 1:23:51 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: they shouldnt have to Mar 18, 2007 1:23:54 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: but you dont know why thats where they work..maybe its the only place that would hire them Mar 18, 2007 1:23:56 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i think those attitudes can be everywhere Mar 18, 2007 1:23:59 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: maybe its close to their house Mar 18, 2007 1:24:04 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: but thats the premise for the whole restauraunt and the whole job, so they do Mar 18, 2007 1:24:04 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: a lot of the girls who work at hooters in the cities are waiting to be actresses Mar 18, 2007 1:24:18 PM EDT
CMC blue322: do you personally know anyone that works at a hooters? Mar 18, 2007 1:24:35 PM EDT

CMC fresca31: she says you wouldnt believe how crazy it gets in there Mar 18, 2007 1:25:17 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: men want to take her picture, they grab her ass, and they whistle at her Mar 18, 2007 1:25:32 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: she says its good money, i say shes an attention freak who has trouble differentiating between good and bad attention Mar 18, 2007 1:25:34 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: but she works there because it is the only place near her school that would hire her when she really needed some extra money Mar 18, 2007 1:26:02 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: when i go to hooters i almost dont even want to talk to the waitress Mar 18, 2007 1:26:24 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: are there any other positions there that she can have? Mar 18, 2007 1:26:26 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: they do that whole sit down at the table and flirt with you thing Mar 18, 2007 1:26:31 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: im kind of uncomfortable around them anyways Mar 18, 2007 1:27:20 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i didnt think the women were very attractive at the one in inner harbor Mar 18, 2007 1:27:22 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: because their job is just so bizarre Mar 18, 2007 1:27:27 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: but i dont even want to deal with all the underlying issues of my conversation with them Mar 18, 2007 1:27:37 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: haha my brother even flew on hooters airlines once with his buddies to check out the women Mar 18, 2007 1:27:43 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: how did that work out for him Mar 18, 2007 1:27:54 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: see..you make a mental note of them and their appearance though' Mar 18, 2007 1:27:54 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: thats just ridiculousa Mar 18, 2007 1:27:55 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: and judge them based on how they look! Mar 18, 2007 1:28:00 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: thats because they promote it Mar 18, 2007 1:28:10 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i just want to say "jesus christ, ill give you a fucking tip, stop jumping rope" Mar 18, 2007 1:28:12 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: in a way yes, but places like hooters probably arent going anywhere Mar 18, 2007 1:28:36 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: sure their job forces them to, but come on, hooters isnt the only restauraunt out there. even if you dont have the money dont give into the discrimination Mar 18, 2007 1:28:37 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i thought they were trying for global domination Mar 18, 2007 1:28:54 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: haha Mar 18, 2007 1:29:00 PM EDT

CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and how does that student body look/act/etc Mar 18, 2007 1:33:36 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i dont think theres gender discrimination as much as a shitty state of gender relations Mar 18, 2007 1:33:38 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: i dont think gender discimination is prevalent Mar 18, 2007 1:33:44 PM EDT

Nicole Becker: okay how about this scenario: Mar 18, 2007 1:34:27 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: i actually think its harder for guys to be their own person and do what they want to do at loyola than it is for girls Mar 18, 2007 1:34:33 PM EDT
CMC blue322: opposite Mar 18, 2007 1:34:47 PM EDT

CMC blue322: no they dont! Mar 18, 2007 1:35:27 PM EDT
CMC blue322: they dress up for guys Mar 18, 2007 1:35:33 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: but what if a guy doesnt drink? its alot harder for him to feel like he fits in than if a girl doesnt want to Mar 18, 2007 1:35:39 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: so they can hook up with some dude? Mar 18, 2007 1:35:47 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: they dress up for other girls Mar 18, 2007 1:35:49 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: okay that clothing that girls wear to the bar just makes dudes want to dive into their pants Mar 18, 2007 1:36:13 PM EDT
CMC blue322: ok... Mar 18, 2007 1:36:23 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: girls dress up so other girls dont talk about how disgusting they look Mar 18, 2007 1:36:28 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: girls degrade themselves by wearing frilly mesh shirts in -5 degree weather with a short skirt Mar 18, 2007 1:36:32 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and then guys take advantage of that Mar 18, 2007 1:36:40 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: still discrimination Mar 18, 2007 1:36:43 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: it is Mar 18, 2007 1:36:48 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i dont think girls dress up so other girls dont talk about them Mar 18, 2007 1:36:55 PM EDT

[Melissa Carbone left the session] Mar 18, 2007 1:37:16 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: that too...but how is their self image enhanced? if they get positive feedback from others Mar 18, 2007 1:37:23 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: then how come girls dont wear really nice non-revealing clothing Mar 18, 2007 1:37:37 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: to the bar Mar 18, 2007 1:37:40 PM EDT
CMC blue322: they feel better about themselves Mar 18, 2007 1:37:41 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: here's a scenario for you guys to think about... : recently in Maryland, several IT executives are being investigated for creating a minority-owned business that was just a front. The executives' wives were listed as the heads of the business so that they could more easily procure goverment contracts targeted at minority and women-owned businesses. .. but there weren't any employees- all the work was to be done by the firms headed by the male executives Mar 18, 2007 1:37:43 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: okay Mar 18, 2007 1:38:10 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: that is weird...and seems like a lot of work to not allow women to make decisions Mar 18, 2007 1:38:16 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: so thats an example of a government program being taken advantage of Mar 18, 2007 1:38:31 PM EDT
CMC blue322: so women owned businesses get help from the govt? Mar 18, 2007 1:38:52 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: thats degrading in itself..its like saying we know women cant do it on their own so we'll lax up things for them Mar 18, 2007 1:39:19 PM EDT
CMC blue322: yeah that sucks Mar 18, 2007 1:39:43 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: or just "we want money, the government will dish out contracts to women owned business, so lets camo ourselves as one of those" Mar 18, 2007 1:39:44 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: thats what happened in this story Mar 18, 2007 1:40:03 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i dont think thats sexism, its just crooked business practices Mar 18, 2007 1:40:11 PM EDT
CMC fresca31: alright nicole, i have to go Mar 18, 2007 1:40:16 PM EDT

Nicole Becker: so you guys don't think that exhibits sexism? Mar 18, 2007 1:41:55 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: that does seem like they were just in it for the money Mar 18, 2007 1:41:57 PM EDT
CMC blue322: people do what they have to do for money Mar 18, 2007 1:42:14 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: like work at a place as discriminating as hooters Mar 18, 2007 1:42:38 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: well what about the fact that the government has contracts targeted towards women-owned businesses, is that sexist against men? Mar 18, 2007 1:42:41 PM EDT
Roberta Sabin: just evesdropping--don't mind me. Mar 18, 2007 1:42:56 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: no more than affirmative action is sexism against white people Mar 18, 2007 1:43:00 PM EDT

CMC blue322: ooooh Mar 18, 2007 1:44:14 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: that govt contract thing for women owned businesses is an official aknowledgement of some kind of inequality Mar 18, 2007 1:44:17 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: do you think the government should have these kinds of programs then? Mar 18, 2007 1:44:19 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: as is affirmative action Mar 18, 2007 1:44:21 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i dont think anyone can think of anything better Mar 18, 2007 1:44:40 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i think that its one thing to acknowledge that it exists and another to try and reverse the roles to fix it Mar 18, 2007 1:44:50 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: i guess if they do have these programs they should make sure that they work and they arent taken advantage of Mar 18, 2007 1:44:55 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: as much as i like the concept i cant say id support it, all that does is anger the old white men who hold the values that women are less Mar 18, 2007 1:45:25 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: and then discrimination is only even furthered Mar 18, 2007 1:45:39 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: it creates tension rather than results Mar 18, 2007 1:45:53 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: do you guys feel there is anything that CAN be done to fix this problem? Mar 18, 2007 1:46:44 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: gradual change Mar 18, 2007 1:46:56 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: which weve seen so far Mar 18, 2007 1:47:02 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i agree Mar 18, 2007 1:47:10 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but it still hasnt made it to the place where it should be Mar 18, 2007 1:47:15 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i dont really know what to say bc i dont hold a full time job Mar 18, 2007 1:47:28 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: its a huge cultural trend/problem though Mar 18, 2007 1:47:42 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: and its been around for thousands of years... so itll take a lot to change it Mar 18, 2007 1:47:53 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: do you guys think people are as aware of sexism as they should be? do we need to raise more awareness of it before the problem can be fixed? Mar 18, 2007 1:48:14 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: we are a more tolerant generation than our parents and i think this will help Mar 18, 2007 1:48:42 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: awareness doesnt really fix things Mar 18, 2007 1:48:55 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: we are more aware of sexism Mar 18, 2007 1:48:56 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: its a start though Mar 18, 2007 1:49:04 PM EDT
CMC blue322: it will take action to change things not awareness Mar 18, 2007 1:49:13 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: you don't feel that awareness is needed before actions can be taken? Mar 18, 2007 1:49:33 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: definatly is Mar 18, 2007 1:49:59 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: awareness is such a cliche term though Mar 18, 2007 1:50:03 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: in order to take action on an issue you need to be aware of it Mar 18, 2007 1:50:09 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: everyone throws it around all the time Mar 18, 2007 1:50:17 PM EDT
Roberta Sabin: Aren't women still paid less than men for the same work? Mar 18, 2007 1:50:35 PM EDT
CMC blue322: i dont know Mar 18, 2007 1:50:44 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: ive seen statistics that show that they are Mar 18, 2007 1:50:56 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: yes, thats the paygap we were talking about a minute ago Mar 18, 2007 1:51:00 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i cant assure you where they are or their validity Mar 18, 2007 1:51:17 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: but i still think that it is pretty clear that there is a gap Mar 18, 2007 1:51:36 PM EDT
CMC blue322: dr. sabin..do you get paid less then other male professors here? Mar 18, 2007 1:52:12 PM EDT
CMC blue322: or do you see that on the loyola campus? Mar 18, 2007 1:54:08 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i dont know if it would exist on the loyola campus Mar 18, 2007 1:54:24 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: loyola unlike most schools is run by the jesuit institution Mar 18, 2007 1:54:35 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: that would have to play some role Mar 18, 2007 1:54:46 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: across corporate america and what not Mar 18, 2007 1:54:56 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: definatly across corporate america Mar 18, 2007 1:55:05 PM EDT
Nicole Becker: what about doctors? do you feel like there is still that stereotype that men are doctors and women are nurses? Mar 18, 2007 1:55:18 PM EDT
CMC GOBIGDONNY: no Mar 18, 2007 1:55:26 PM EDT

CMC GOBIGDONNY: but the doctors part though? Mar 18, 2007 1:56:05 PM EDT
CMC ShoopDaWhoop: i think that could be argued Mar 18, 2007 1:56:13 PM EDT
CMC blue322: everywhere i go there is an equal spread of doctors and nurses Mar 18, 2007 1:56:13 PM EDT
