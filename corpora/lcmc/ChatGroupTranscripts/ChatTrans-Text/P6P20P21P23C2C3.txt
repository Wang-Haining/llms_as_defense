Melissa Carbone: OK your first topic is the catholic church Mar 25, 2007 4:06:25 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: does anyone feel that they need to reform their ways for the 21st century Mar 25, 2007 4:06:41 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yes Mar 25, 2007 4:06:47 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yep Mar 25, 2007 4:06:49 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: nope Mar 25, 2007 4:06:55 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i heard recently that they might have found Jesus' body? Mar 25, 2007 4:07:08 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: no, that's a load of bs Mar 25, 2007 4:07:16 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that's on the discovery channel Mar 25, 2007 4:07:19 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: it's crap Mar 25, 2007 4:07:22 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 25, 2007 4:07:23 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah. jesus was a common name back then. Mar 25, 2007 4:07:34 PM EDT
CMC dah88: hahaa i guess Mar 25, 2007 4:07:39 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: they found a tomb of some ancient people...so they probaby automatically assumed JESUS! Mar 25, 2007 4:07:55 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 25, 2007 4:07:56 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah. time to re-write the bible again. Mar 25, 2007 4:08:11 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: I don't think so Mar 25, 2007 4:08:20 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean Mar 25, 2007 4:08:21 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think they need to twist things alot but basically live by the same rules Mar 25, 2007 4:08:37 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: why should a religion change to fit what people want? Mar 25, 2007 4:08:38 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: the way i figure it Mar 25, 2007 4:08:54 PM EDT
CMC dah88: times change Mar 25, 2007 4:09:01 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: people want the church to change because of things that they don't personally agree with Mar 25, 2007 4:09:13 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: sorry, but is anybody saying anything right now? i just want to make sure my internet didn't freeze again Mar 25, 2007 4:09:13 PM EDT
[CMC littlestanemone left the session] Mar 25, 2007 4:09:24 PM EDT
CMC dah88: uh oh Mar 25, 2007 4:09:34 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: they don't have to change, but what i mean is that if they intend to survive as a relevant social force, they should change, or else they'll lose that relevance Mar 25, 2007 4:09:41 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: and yeah, ruh-roh Mar 25, 2007 4:09:46 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! THE INTERNET HAS GOT LITLESTANEMONE!!!!! Mar 25, 2007 4:09:46 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i agree with ya frogger Mar 25, 2007 4:10:05 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i don't see the point in doing that Mar 25, 2007 4:10:18 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean Mar 25, 2007 4:10:19 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: a religion wouldn't be a steadfast religion if it changed as times changed Mar 25, 2007 4:10:37 PM EDT
CMC dah88: times change - you have it has to somehow adapt to thechange Mar 25, 2007 4:10:44 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: as in constantly Mar 25, 2007 4:10:48 PM EDT
CMC dah88: it doesnt have to change its views Mar 25, 2007 4:10:50 PM EDT
CMC dah88: the church has aldready changed from the time of Jesus Mar 25, 2007 4:11:16 PM EDT
CMC dah88: we dont fast for days Mar 25, 2007 4:11:22 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: So if the Church would change, what do you guys think that it would change? Mar 25, 2007 4:11:22 PM EDT
[CMC littlestanemone joined the session] Mar 25, 2007 4:11:24 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: wow, i diea. i'm sorry Mar 25, 2007 4:11:41 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: died* Mar 25, 2007 4:11:43 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, and it's fine if they want to remain the way they are now, but they're going to lose significant portions of their members, and i don't think they want that Mar 25, 2007 4:11:43 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: haha, salgood Mar 25, 2007 4:11:53 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: they obviously don't want that, yeah Mar 25, 2007 4:11:59 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think they shuold become somewhat more lenient Mar 25, 2007 4:12:04 PM EDT
CMC dah88: they are already losing members becaus of the priest issues Mar 25, 2007 4:12:28 PM EDT
CMC dah88: in long island a whole catholic school is going to close due to lack of attendance Mar 25, 2007 4:12:54 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well in reality, if people are going away from religion based upon stuff like that, then they don't have enough faith in their own religion anyways Mar 25, 2007 4:13:02 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i think their biggest issues involve 1.) birth control, and probably even more importantly 2.) the structure of the church istelf Mar 25, 2007 4:13:22 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i disagree Mar 25, 2007 4:13:24 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: me too Mar 25, 2007 4:13:28 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: what's wrong with the structure of the church? Mar 25, 2007 4:13:46 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i believe that as a catholic - u have a personal joice of how you want to worship Mar 25, 2007 4:13:47 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: do you mean like the heirarchy? Mar 25, 2007 4:13:54 PM EDT
CMC dah88: choice* wow lol Mar 25, 2007 4:13:56 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yes. the structure of the is paternalistic and insulated; this often causes it to lose touch with significant portions of its congregation Mar 25, 2007 4:14:45 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think that if you choose not to go to church because u dont get anything out of it - thats your choice - ersonally thats how i feel but i still worship Mar 25, 2007 4:14:57 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: paternalistic? like only men can be preiests? Mar 25, 2007 4:15:03 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i feel the same dah88 Mar 25, 2007 4:15:16 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yes, and the hierarchy itself (pope as father of the church) Mar 25, 2007 4:15:21 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i agree with the paternalistic comment as well Mar 25, 2007 4:15:41 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i agree with that Mar 25, 2007 4:15:50 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: women being priests i think would solve a lot of problems many people have with the church Mar 25, 2007 4:16:06 PM EDT
CMC dah88: the world is changing, women have rights and are eqquals, why cant they be priests? Mar 25, 2007 4:16:14 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i agree Mar 25, 2007 4:16:21 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but about the heirarchy... what would happen to the church if the pope wasnt the lead authority any more? Mar 25, 2007 4:16:29 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yep Mar 25, 2007 4:16:29 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i'm not saying he shouldn't be Mar 25, 2007 4:16:40 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: ok, i guess i just dont understand Mar 25, 2007 4:16:50 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i figure the church made itself the way it is for specific reasons, and therefore i don't hink that it should change, like having women priests...etc. Mar 25, 2007 4:17:01 PM EDT
CMC dah88: it made itself thousands of years ago Mar 25, 2007 4:17:14 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i'm just saying that the structure shouldn't be so insulated; none of the rank and file church members have any say in what goes on in the upper echelons Mar 25, 2007 4:17:23 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: and this leads to the kind of corruption you saw in the priest scandal Mar 25, 2007 4:17:38 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yup Mar 25, 2007 4:17:45 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: so you think the church should be more democratic instead of authoritarian? Mar 25, 2007 4:17:48 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah Mar 25, 2007 4:17:55 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: because that would be a good idea Mar 25, 2007 4:17:59 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i agree Mar 25, 2007 4:18:03 PM EDT
CMC dah88: whats wrong with women priests? because it wasnt accepted socially a thousand yrs ago? Mar 25, 2007 4:18:05 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i figure that they can be nuns and thats good enough Mar 25, 2007 4:18:27 PM EDT
CMC dah88: how do u figure Mar 25, 2007 4:18:41 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: the rationale was based upon traditional views of gender roles which are now outmoded Mar 25, 2007 4:18:50 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think a religion has a certain amount of responsibility to stick to its foundations, but also a responsibility to serve the needs of its people Mar 25, 2007 4:18:55 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: it's kind of like how guys and girls have different sports? i guess is the best way to explain it Mar 25, 2007 4:19:00 PM EDT
CMC dah88: this is about rights not sports Mar 25, 2007 4:19:12 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i realize that Mar 25, 2007 4:19:18 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah... but girl can play on boys teams if they really want to and they're good Mar 25, 2007 4:19:18 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 25, 2007 4:19:20 PM EDT
CMC dah88: so its alot different Mar 25, 2007 4:19:30 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: and the guys sport is the power to change the bread and wine into christ's blood and flesh and minister to the people, whereas the nuns mostly pray in convents Mar 25, 2007 4:19:56 PM EDT
CMC dah88: some women would make wonderful priests and its a shame that the church wont let them share that Mar 25, 2007 4:19:57 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: you seem to have a really positive view of the role of nuns.... Mar 25, 2007 4:20:15 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i'm not saying they'd be bad at being priests Mar 25, 2007 4:20:25 PM EDT
CMC dah88: the church is lacking priests as it is - it would be a good move Mar 25, 2007 4:20:26 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: haha, i was pointing out the disparity between their roles, not commenting on what they do Mar 25, 2007 4:20:35 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: and i'm not putting down on nuns Mar 25, 2007 4:20:44 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i know but its true - all we can do in the church is pray in convents, and give homilies once in a while Mar 25, 2007 4:20:49 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: hey i know, i didnt mean it to sound like that Mar 25, 2007 4:21:03 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yep. which is not the same. at all. Mar 25, 2007 4:21:05 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: its just cause you're right Mar 25, 2007 4:21:07 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: right now women can't really contribute to the church at all Mar 25, 2007 4:21:26 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but we're still members... Mar 25, 2007 4:21:36 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: church is about giving ones self into service of God and others Mar 25, 2007 4:21:46 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah. you have to be a man to have a significant decision-making role Mar 25, 2007 4:21:46 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: how can you say that nuns don't really contribute? Mar 25, 2007 4:22:03 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i'm not saying they don't contribute at all Mar 25, 2007 4:22:15 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: but they don't make any policy-making decisions Mar 25, 2007 4:22:26 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well neither do priests, really, do they? Mar 25, 2007 4:22:41 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: that goes back to the heirarchy Mar 25, 2007 4:22:48 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah they really dont Mar 25, 2007 4:22:53 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: no, but priests have the potential to through promotion Mar 25, 2007 4:22:53 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well they work their way up "the chain" Mar 25, 2007 4:22:59 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah Mar 25, 2007 4:23:00 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: true Mar 25, 2007 4:23:00 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: plus, as one nun once pointed out to me, priests make a hell of a lot more money Mar 25, 2007 4:23:40 PM EDT
CMC dah88: wow yeah Mar 25, 2007 4:23:50 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: wow i never knew that Mar 25, 2007 4:23:51 PM EDT
CMC dah88: they do Mar 25, 2007 4:23:57 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i believe it Mar 25, 2007 4:24:01 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: being a nun seems liek the equivalent of being a monk to me Mar 25, 2007 4:24:16 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well they don't really make a lot of money, but like housing and stuff is provided for i thought Mar 25, 2007 4:24:24 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yep. it's a much more comparable role Mar 25, 2007 4:24:29 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (priests) Mar 25, 2007 4:24:29 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: no, they definitely make more money Mar 25, 2007 4:24:42 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i know a lot Mar 25, 2007 4:24:45 PM EDT
CMC dah88: priests do make more Mar 25, 2007 4:24:57 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: (of priests, i mean) Mar 25, 2007 4:25:02 PM EDT
CMC dah88: a nun i feel takes more of the "giving up of possessions" role Mar 25, 2007 4:25:24 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: right Mar 25, 2007 4:25:32 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and thats right for some women Mar 25, 2007 4:25:39 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yes, but those are the only roles open to them Mar 25, 2007 4:25:48 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but they also make an oath of "joyful service" Mar 25, 2007 4:25:51 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but others would do better in the role of a priest Mar 25, 2007 4:25:54 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right Mar 25, 2007 4:26:13 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i talked with father rossi about that the other day Mar 25, 2007 4:26:20 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well, i attended a talk Mar 25, 2007 4:26:26 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: what is the whole women not being preists thing based on anyhow? the 12 apostles? Mar 25, 2007 4:26:44 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, an ingrained view of the male in the role of shepherd, more generally Mar 25, 2007 4:27:18 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think its just about peter and how he was the father of the church ( i could b wrong) Mar 25, 2007 4:27:28 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i really have no clue Mar 25, 2007 4:27:42 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: partially, but in the very early church, there were female priests with some comparable powers Mar 25, 2007 4:27:57 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: there's some specious documentation of it Mar 25, 2007 4:28:07 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: ok Mar 25, 2007 4:28:08 PM EDT
CMC dah88: interesting Mar 25, 2007 4:28:10 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well Mar 25, 2007 4:28:11 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: but that changed once it was organized Mar 25, 2007 4:28:18 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Mar 25, 2007 4:28:22 PM EDT
CMC dah88: does anyone regularly attend church? Mar 25, 2007 4:28:55 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i know that lots of things in the church are based on tradition, and that is good. we wouldn't have religion without tradition. but it seems to me that when the tradition becomes this ingrained and stubbornly enforced, its more of a hindrance than a help Mar 25, 2007 4:29:15 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i used to Mar 25, 2007 4:29:19 PM EDT
CMC dah88: wow i agree Mar 25, 2007 4:29:33 PM EDT
CMC dah88: good point Mar 25, 2007 4:29:46 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: true dat Mar 25, 2007 4:29:56 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: btw, i looked it up and it looks like the whole just male priests bit is based upon the 12 apostles Mar 25, 2007 4:30:07 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats what i thought Mar 25, 2007 4:30:15 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and it makes no sense to me Mar 25, 2007 4:30:20 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Mar 25, 2007 4:30:42 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: because that was a day and age where only men really had to option to "go out and spread the good word" like that Mar 25, 2007 4:30:49 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and now women have the same abilities and responibilities that men do Mar 25, 2007 4:31:18 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, they probably would have offed jesus a lot sooner if he'd walked around with a bunch of women as his right-hand people Mar 25, 2007 4:31:23 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: hahahahaha Mar 25, 2007 4:31:28 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i bet Mar 25, 2007 4:31:36 PM EDT
CMC dah88: hahahahha Mar 25, 2007 4:31:42 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think it would only benefit the church Mar 25, 2007 4:31:53 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think they are just denying the fact they have to adapt Mar 25, 2007 4:32:03 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: me too Mar 25, 2007 4:32:06 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: here, i found this on a website Mar 25, 2007 4:32:06 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: "Only a baptized man (vir) receives sacred ordination. The lord jesus chose men (viri) to form the college of the twelve apolstles, and the apolstles did the same when they chose collaborators to succeed them in their ministry. Mar 25, 2007 4:32:55 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: right, thats what ive heard Mar 25, 2007 4:33:27 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, but that outlines a tradition, not a reason Mar 25, 2007 4:33:33 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but is that a good reason for it to stay that way? Mar 25, 2007 4:33:39 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah - i still think thats because thats what was accepted at the time Mar 25, 2007 4:33:42 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: same Mar 25, 2007 4:33:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: The college of bishops, with whom the priests are united in the priesthood, makes the college of the twelve an ever-present and ever-active reality until Christ's return. The Churhc recognizes herself to be bound by this choice made by the Lord Himself. For this reason the ordination of women is not possible. Mar 25, 2007 4:33:54 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: they just feel like if Christ made the decision of that, then that would probably be the best decision Mar 25, 2007 4:34:25 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: right Mar 25, 2007 4:34:30 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: for 2000 years ago Mar 25, 2007 4:34:34 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: hey, Christ wasn't dumb Mar 25, 2007 4:34:39 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: that's sophistry though. jesus' gender would have been irrelevant in another context Mar 25, 2007 4:34:53 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah - no disrespect for Jesus - but i dont think he was looking too far ahead Mar 25, 2007 4:35:06 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Mar 25, 2007 4:35:26 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well he probably didn't think that his followers would imitate every single little thing he did for centuries Mar 25, 2007 4:35:28 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: its like how some people use the old testament to jusitfy gay bashing Mar 25, 2007 4:36:03 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah. we don't walk everywhere in sandals anymore. Mar 25, 2007 4:36:03 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha yeah Mar 25, 2007 4:36:11 PM EDT
CMC dah88: if we can change the ages for whom has to participate in not eating meat on fridays and we can make up rules like that - y cnt women b priests Mar 25, 2007 4:36:14 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: seriously Mar 25, 2007 4:36:26 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, here's the thing about the no meat on fridays Mar 25, 2007 4:36:36 PM EDT
CMC dah88: its for medical reaons right? Mar 25, 2007 4:36:48 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: that was instituted to help the fishing industry, since a lot of catholics fished Mar 25, 2007 4:36:50 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yep - and times have changed Mar 25, 2007 4:37:05 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: just more reasons the catholic church should rethink its traditions Mar 25, 2007 4:37:27 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah. and priests not being able to marry was instituted because when they could, the title of priest became heriditary, and they could bequeath church property to their children, which caused financial problems Mar 25, 2007 4:37:51 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well going back to the whole jesus didn't look to far ahead comment, the church believes in divine omnipotence Mar 25, 2007 4:38:13 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah thats weird Mar 25, 2007 4:38:14 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (sorry, a little late) Mar 25, 2007 4:38:19 PM EDT
CMC dah88: what do u mean Mar 25, 2007 4:38:36 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, but jesus didn't necessarily have omnipotence in the general sense, b/c he was corporeal Mar 25, 2007 4:38:50 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: also, the only accounts we have of his life are secondhand Mar 25, 2007 4:39:48 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and mostly written by men. Mar 25, 2007 4:39:52 PM EDT
CMC dah88: 60yrs after his death Mar 25, 2007 4:40:01 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: so we don't ACTUALLY know what he did and didn't do to the specifics Mar 25, 2007 4:40:11 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah. and often badly trasnlated Mar 25, 2007 4:40:14 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: *translated Mar 25, 2007 4:40:22 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Mar 25, 2007 4:40:29 PM EDT
CMC dah88: and the Bible is meant to be taken figuratively not iterally Mar 25, 2007 4:40:30 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: it depends on which parts of the bible Mar 25, 2007 4:40:54 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: there's so much going against the literal interpretation of the Bible - it's almost irrational to take it as absolute truth Mar 25, 2007 4:40:58 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: which is a problem i'll say Mar 25, 2007 4:40:59 PM EDT
CMC dah88: by parts u mean just the new testament? Mar 25, 2007 4:41:30 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (frogger, where are yougetting your information? is it just assumed or is it factual?) Mar 25, 2007 4:41:55 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: 12 years of catholic education, not including loyola Mar 25, 2007 4:42:12 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: and i have an uncle who's a priest Mar 25, 2007 4:42:20 PM EDT
CMC dah88: hahaha i hear ya Mar 25, 2007 4:42:24 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: wow ok Mar 25, 2007 4:42:27 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 25, 2007 4:42:29 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: haha, shh...don't tell i was criticizing the church Mar 25, 2007 4:42:48 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: what does your uncle think? Mar 25, 2007 4:42:48 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: lol Mar 25, 2007 4:43:08 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: he's actually very liberal on things like this. he's for women priests and married priests, but he'd been told by the bishop several times to keep his mouth shut in public about it Mar 25, 2007 4:43:24 PM EDT
CMC dah88: wow interesting Mar 25, 2007 4:43:37 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i dont like the secret aspect of the hurch Mar 25, 2007 4:43:48 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: my grandpa and uncle who are deacons feel the same way Mar 25, 2007 4:43:49 PM EDT
CMC dah88: church* Mar 25, 2007 4:43:52 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Mar 25, 2007 4:43:54 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i feel like evrything is very hush hush Mar 25, 2007 4:44:01 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: they have to put on the appearance of unity though Mar 25, 2007 4:44:05 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i suppose... Mar 25, 2007 4:44:11 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Mar 25, 2007 4:44:12 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, most of the decision-making goes on in the upper echelons and then is handed down as writ Mar 25, 2007 4:44:21 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Mar 25, 2007 4:44:30 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah - i mean, the church even got to decide what we regard as the Bible Mar 25, 2007 4:44:49 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: so how are we supposed to say that the Bible is absolute? Mar 25, 2007 4:45:14 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: from beginning to end it's human interpretation Mar 25, 2007 4:45:29 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i just feel like the church isnt a welcoming place Mar 25, 2007 4:45:36 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and by human, i mean men Mar 25, 2007 4:45:42 PM EDT
CMC dah88: it intimidates me Mar 25, 2007 4:45:45 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: really? why? Mar 25, 2007 4:45:57 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: if you talk to a priest about it, you should think differently Mar 25, 2007 4:46:20 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: especially here at loyola Mar 25, 2007 4:46:38 PM EDT
CMC dah88: my aunt got pregnant at 17 and was shunned by her church i just fel like its not as welcoming of an institution as it should be - Jesus being compassionate and all Mar 25, 2007 4:46:42 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: how old's your aunt? Mar 25, 2007 4:46:59 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: aww - well i have to say that sucks, but it does depend on the church Mar 25, 2007 4:47:07 PM EDT
CMC dah88: almost 60 Mar 25, 2007 4:47:08 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, the views of individual priests vary widely, of course, too Mar 25, 2007 4:47:24 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: my cousin is 19 and she got pregnant out of marriage last year, and her church was very supportive Mar 25, 2007 4:47:33 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: it's so different from area to area Mar 25, 2007 4:47:41 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: its awful Mar 25, 2007 4:47:45 PM EDT
CMC dah88: true Mar 25, 2007 4:47:46 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah Mar 25, 2007 4:48:01 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: any church i have seen would support the person Mar 25, 2007 4:48:10 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: and some priests are just jerks....they're all different- they're human Mar 25, 2007 4:48:31 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Mar 25, 2007 4:48:36 PM EDT
CMC dah88: very true Mar 25, 2007 4:48:38 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, the problem is more the decision-making structure Mar 25, 2007 4:48:53 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Mar 25, 2007 4:49:15 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: so do you guys think like if they had voting things within the church for priests and nuns that everything would be better? Mar 25, 2007 4:49:46 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yes Mar 25, 2007 4:50:03 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: probably. it doesn't seem like a very likely option, though Mar 25, 2007 4:50:20 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: no, not at all, because the higher-ups probably wouldn't care at all Mar 25, 2007 4:50:20 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i do think that that would help out obviously a LOT Mar 25, 2007 4:50:24 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: it would just be going through the motions Mar 25, 2007 4:50:29 PM EDT
CMC dah88: because then it wouldnt be jsut the view of one person making all the desicions Mar 25, 2007 4:50:31 PM EDT
CMC dah88: just like a president Mar 25, 2007 4:50:37 PM EDT
CMC dah88: at least he would hear more views and be more open minded (the pope) Mar 25, 2007 4:50:56 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well the way i'd figure it would be the voting could be for reference reason sfor the guys way up Mar 25, 2007 4:51:02 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think that somehow everyone over 50 would have to leave the church first before that happened Mar 25, 2007 4:51:05 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats true Mar 25, 2007 4:51:16 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i agree with dah Mar 25, 2007 4:51:17 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: maybe then he would see the extent of people who are dissatisfied Mar 25, 2007 4:51:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: no, my parents are devout catholics, and they'd totally support that (they're over 50) Mar 25, 2007 4:51:58 PM EDT
CMC dah88: wait what does it have to dowith eople over 50? Mar 25, 2007 4:52:03 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: nonono, i meant all the cardinals and all Mar 25, 2007 4:52:09 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (different generation...different views..) Mar 25, 2007 4:52:14 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: here - Mar 25, 2007 4:52:15 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but wouldnt they want their opinions heard more? Mar 25, 2007 4:52:32 PM EDT
CMC dah88: im not sure i understand lol Mar 25, 2007 4:52:38 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i know some nice, very liberal old preists who want to change - but they are the serious minority Mar 25, 2007 4:52:39 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: at least from what i've seen Mar 25, 2007 4:52:44 PM EDT
CMC dah88: as new priests climb the ladder - i feel like the church will naturally become more liberal Mar 25, 2007 4:53:05 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats what i think too Mar 25, 2007 4:53:12 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: and we have to remember that the views of american catholics are very different from those elsewhere in the world in many cases Mar 25, 2007 4:53:38 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think the voting system would never work until there are people in power who will listen to the votes Mar 25, 2007 4:53:40 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats true Mar 25, 2007 4:53:47 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: ahhhh! global issues! Mar 25, 2007 4:54:06 PM EDT
CMC dah88: true Mar 25, 2007 4:54:33 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i actually completely forgot that there might be people elsewhere in the world who would fight to keep the church the way it is Mar 25, 2007 4:54:40 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, we need to remember that changing the church would change it all over the world, not just the U.S....so if priests around the world don't agree with the U.S...tough luck, that's the way it goes... Mar 25, 2007 4:54:58 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: wow, there is SO much to think about in overhauling a massive oranization like the church Mar 25, 2007 4:55:03 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah - i thinkeverywhere else they would want it to stay the way it is Mar 25, 2007 4:55:03 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: for that reason, since the U.S. would be the minority, i don't hink that it should change Mar 25, 2007 4:55:28 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: we need to keep the majority of the church happy Mar 25, 2007 4:55:35 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think it shuld but i dont think it could Mar 25, 2007 4:55:44 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha we could break off and form our own church like England did Mar 25, 2007 4:55:55 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: can you imagine out much controversy that would create? Mar 25, 2007 4:56:32 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 25, 2007 4:56:33 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha ooooooh yeah i can. Mar 25, 2007 4:56:40 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i can't Mar 25, 2007 4:56:45 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 25, 2007 4:56:46 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, i don't know that it's true to say that the majority wouldn't want any kind of change. it's not all or nothing Mar 25, 2007 4:56:47 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: just kidding about breaking off :) Mar 25, 2007 4:56:55 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i know Mar 25, 2007 4:56:59 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: haha Mar 25, 2007 4:56:59 PM EDT
CMC dah88: didnt the church spit once b4 and it was chaos Mar 25, 2007 4:57:12 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think we need to see what the majority says first Mar 25, 2007 4:57:15 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Mar 25, 2007 4:57:24 PM EDT
CMC dah88: that would be interesting to see Mar 25, 2007 4:57:30 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: we dont really know how other countries feel at all right now Mar 25, 2007 4:57:39 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: at least i dont Mar 25, 2007 4:57:42 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well Germany would definitely be against it with benny D as pope Mar 25, 2007 4:58:30 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i feel like the euro counrties would be more reluctant to change Mar 25, 2007 4:58:45 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: what about africa? Mar 25, 2007 4:58:57 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: people die every day in africa for being christian Mar 25, 2007 4:59:11 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, some, but not necessarily all. we have to remember that there's as much potential dissent within countries as here, too Mar 25, 2007 4:59:16 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think if their thoughts are that steadfast, then they won't want to change Mar 25, 2007 4:59:20 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: there are still a large percentage of catholics in africa Mar 25, 2007 4:59:32 PM EDT
CMC dah88: u never know - we cant make assumptions Mar 25, 2007 4:59:40 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: even if they die for it Mar 25, 2007 4:59:48 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i had a priest from africa talk to my church about it Mar 25, 2007 5:00:06 PM EDT
CMC dah88: cool Mar 25, 2007 5:00:12 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well...it was kind of depressing Mar 25, 2007 5:00:23 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Mar 25, 2007 5:00:24 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i believe it Mar 25, 2007 5:00:29 PM EDT
CMC dah88: by cool i meant interesting lol Mar 25, 2007 5:00:40 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i know, i was joking Mar 25, 2007 5:00:50 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but look at it that way Mar 25, 2007 5:01:15 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: if you're dying for a cause Mar 25, 2007 5:01:19 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: would you want the cause not to steady, but changing a lot? Mar 25, 2007 5:01:31 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i sure as hell wouldn't want that Mar 25, 2007 5:01:46 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: the thing is, we're comfortable enough here that we can philosophize about ways to make it better Mar 25, 2007 5:02:01 PM EDT
CMC dah88: lol...im not sure still - u cnt make assumptions as large as this Mar 25, 2007 5:02:02 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: in africa, so much is going on that they just accept what is Mar 25, 2007 5:02:11 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: what are we assuming? that everyone else wouldn't want to change? Mar 25, 2007 5:02:52 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i believe that Mar 25, 2007 5:02:54 PM EDT
CMC dah88: that most people want i to stay the same Mar 25, 2007 5:03:08 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: OK would everyone like to throw out some final thoughts and then we will move on to the next topic? Mar 25, 2007 5:03:24 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i couldnt say one way or another without a poll Mar 25, 2007 5:03:29 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: sure, all done Mar 25, 2007 5:03:34 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yup Mar 25, 2007 5:03:44 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: kew Mar 25, 2007 5:03:46 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: good to go Mar 25, 2007 5:04:18 PM EDT
