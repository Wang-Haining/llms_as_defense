Melissa Carbone: how do you all feel about school officials being able to check myspace and facebook profiles? Apr 15, 2007 4:00:58 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: do you feel that is an invasion of privacy? Apr 15, 2007 4:01:07 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think its a little weird Apr 15, 2007 4:01:17 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: if you have your profile set to private, than yes. otherwise, it's in a public forum Apr 15, 2007 4:01:27 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: it's kind of weird but they're within their rights Apr 15, 2007 4:01:33 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:01:39 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think that its ok for people who are interviewing you for a job can do that but not your teachers Apr 15, 2007 4:01:41 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i don't like the idea AT ALL, but it IS public Apr 15, 2007 4:01:48 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: right, if its public, you dont get to choose who can and can't look Apr 15, 2007 4:01:50 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:01:57 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: seriously Apr 15, 2007 4:01:58 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but on the other hand Apr 15, 2007 4:02:03 PM EDT
CMC dah88: so u cant say like no you can do that Apr 15, 2007 4:02:04 PM EDT
CMC dah88: cant* Apr 15, 2007 4:02:12 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: exactly, but everything that goes up on stuff like facebook is like partying (for the most part) Apr 15, 2007 4:02:33 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: true Apr 15, 2007 4:02:42 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that doesn't give a good representation of the people Apr 15, 2007 4:02:45 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but thats a personal choice Apr 15, 2007 4:02:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: true Apr 15, 2007 4:02:50 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Apr 15, 2007 4:02:51 PM EDT
CMC dah88: they dont have to but those pictures up Apr 15, 2007 4:02:57 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well you can post pics of yourself being normal too Apr 15, 2007 4:02:59 PM EDT
CMC dah88: however i dont think facebook should be used to gather a first impression of someone Apr 15, 2007 4:03:10 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, but for me....i'm not going to put up pics of me studying, which is what i do 24/7 Apr 15, 2007 4:03:21 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Apr 15, 2007 4:03:22 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha Apr 15, 2007 4:03:25 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean Apr 15, 2007 4:03:29 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right, but there's no way to prevent people from looking at the profiles Apr 15, 2007 4:03:40 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: ME AND WESTERN CIV....NEW FACEBOOK PICS! AWWWWRIGHT! Apr 15, 2007 4:03:42 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right thats why teachers shouldnt go on to get a first impression Apr 15, 2007 4:03:46 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: oh baby Apr 15, 2007 4:03:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: hahah Apr 15, 2007 4:03:49 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats true Apr 15, 2007 4:03:53 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: very true Apr 15, 2007 4:04:02 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i mean, they would have to take it with a grain of salt Apr 15, 2007 4:04:02 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and KNOW that the kids they're looking at aren't like that all the time Apr 15, 2007 4:04:24 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i dont think its any of the teachers business and i dont know why they would want to look except to be nosey but its their right Apr 15, 2007 4:04:34 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Apr 15, 2007 4:04:38 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i don' think that' they're violating anyone's rights, but on the other hand, it's not a good method for them to go about if they want to get good information Apr 15, 2007 4:04:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: so basically, i agree Apr 15, 2007 4:04:58 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Apr 15, 2007 4:04:59 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats true Apr 15, 2007 4:04:59 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: why would they want to see that? Apr 15, 2007 4:05:06 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha Apr 15, 2007 4:05:08 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:05:14 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: it really is creepy Apr 15, 2007 4:05:20 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: ok, so all the kids in your class go out once in a while on the weekend Apr 15, 2007 4:05:31 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but look at america in general Apr 15, 2007 4:05:33 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: does that affect how you treat or grade them? Apr 15, 2007 4:05:42 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i guess if i was a teacher i would probably look too because i ammmm nosey Apr 15, 2007 4:05:44 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: america is OBSESSED with looking at other peoples' personal lives Apr 15, 2007 4:05:45 PM EDT
CMC dah88: true Apr 15, 2007 4:05:53 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah lol Apr 15, 2007 4:06:13 PM EDT
CMC dah88: seeing that some kids do drink heavily on the weekends may effect how the teacher views them and grades them Apr 15, 2007 4:06:17 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, but at the same time, people are posting their lives on-line Apr 15, 2007 4:06:17 PM EDT
CMC dah88: very true Apr 15, 2007 4:06:28 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: if that's what you're doing, that's the risk you run Apr 15, 2007 4:06:35 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: everyone gets warned a LOT on entering college that teachers and admins may look at your profile, and to be careful Apr 15, 2007 4:06:51 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: not many listen, though Apr 15, 2007 4:07:05 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: very true Apr 15, 2007 4:07:12 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well, at least we get fair warning about it Apr 15, 2007 4:07:17 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:07:23 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: we do, but on the other hand, i don't hink that they should be anal about it Apr 15, 2007 4:07:33 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: how do you mean? Apr 15, 2007 4:07:46 PM EDT
CMC dah88: no, but they most likely will Apr 15, 2007 4:07:49 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well i don't know how anal they really are Apr 15, 2007 4:07:50 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: very true Apr 15, 2007 4:07:57 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: so far i've only had one professor who actually went on and looked Apr 15, 2007 4:08:02 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: (at least that i know of... lol) Apr 15, 2007 4:08:12 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think i've only heard like one or two stories of people getting screwed by it Apr 15, 2007 4:08:14 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah, same Apr 15, 2007 4:08:19 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, if they wanted to just cruise facebook for a while, half the school would be going in for judiciary hearings Apr 15, 2007 4:08:25 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:08:33 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: it's not worth it, they don't want to do that to us Apr 15, 2007 4:08:51 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think dah is right, it's more of a nosiness thing Apr 15, 2007 4:09:01 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:09:01 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yep, and they don't have the resources, anyway Apr 15, 2007 4:09:16 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: this definitely goes back to the cliche of judging a book by its cover Apr 15, 2007 4:10:22 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think more students should kno bout this though Apr 15, 2007 4:10:26 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think that employers should only base their opinions off of things like resumes and interviews Apr 15, 2007 4:10:41 PM EDT
CMC dah88: because i think they put up pictures on facebook like its nothing not knowing that they now belong to facebook Apr 15, 2007 4:10:52 PM EDT
CMC dah88: it shhhhooooulld b that way, but it wont Apr 15, 2007 4:11:09 PM EDT

CMC frogger428: yeah, he stands to make a lot of money off facebook Apr 15, 2007 4:11:41 PM EDT
CMC dah88: which i think is kind of creepy Apr 15, 2007 4:11:46 PM EDT
CMC dah88: seriously Apr 15, 2007 4:11:52 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: employers should only look at the things that would affect work performance - if what kids do in pictures doesn't affect their school performance, it won't affect them at work Apr 15, 2007 4:12:08 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i thought you can remove the pictures Apr 15, 2007 4:12:13 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: someone offered him an exorbitant sum for ownership of the site (i forget what the figure was) and he turned it down Apr 15, 2007 4:12:23 PM EDT
CMC dah88: they even say after you delete your proifile, the pictures still belong to mark wwhatever his last name is Apr 15, 2007 4:12:42 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: wow, i'm slowly hating facebook Apr 15, 2007 4:13:00 PM EDT

CMC dah88: that will be an interesting case Apr 15, 2007 4:14:35 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: so how do you guys feel about privacy in relation to your safety Apr 15, 2007 4:14:46 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: for instance if a threat were posted Apr 15, 2007 4:15:05 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i don't think that many people take that seriously Apr 15, 2007 4:15:19 PM EDT
CMC dah88: when it comes to national security, i think the gov has to do what they have to do Apr 15, 2007 4:15:23 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: if it were publicly posted and not in an email or something, the police should have every right to act Apr 15, 2007 4:15:28 PM EDT
CMC dah88: right Apr 15, 2007 4:15:37 PM EDT
CMC dah88: its their job Apr 15, 2007 4:15:46 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean, i've said things to people, and they're like COME DOWN TO NORTH CAROLINA AND SAY THAT TO MY FACE.....i'm in maryland...so no??? Apr 15, 2007 4:15:51 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that's for like a personal case Apr 15, 2007 4:15:55 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well yeah, a lot of threats like that aren't serious, but if its been made by someone they've been watching for a while they should investigate Apr 15, 2007 4:16:06 PM EDT
CMC dah88: exactly Apr 15, 2007 4:16:23 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: frogger? Apr 15, 2007 4:16:25 PM EDT
CMC dah88: especially if it could lead to something as horrible as 9/11 Apr 15, 2007 4:16:35 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right, public officials have the right to act on information they have legitimate, legal access to Apr 15, 2007 4:16:36 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, stuff like that is never serious Apr 15, 2007 4:16:39 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:17:37 PM EDT
CMC dah88: we always agree lol Apr 15, 2007 4:17:49 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i know lol Apr 15, 2007 4:17:54 PM EDT

CMC John_Bastow: ahhhh the separation of this glorious group! Apr 15, 2007 4:18:57 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: I DON'T THINK THAT OFFICIALS SHOULD BE WASTING THEIR TIME CHECKING FACEBOOK Apr 15, 2007 4:19:09 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: there, what do you think about that? Apr 15, 2007 4:19:15 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well they dont Apr 15, 2007 4:19:24 PM EDT

[CMC dah88 left the session] Apr 15, 2007 4:19:36 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: well, it is mostly a waste of time, since they rarely act on it Apr 15, 2007 4:19:38 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think your right haha Apr 15, 2007 4:19:42 PM EDT

CMC littlestanemone: the kid who posted a threat bulletin Apr 15, 2007 4:21:05 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: if you're planning something you don't want other people to know about, don't post it in a public forum Apr 15, 2007 4:21:10 PM EDT
CMC dah88: ooooooo Apr 15, 2007 4:21:12 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: the one in this question Apr 15, 2007 4:21:16 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: oh ahaha, i thought you meant something recently on the news Apr 15, 2007 4:21:18 PM EDT

CMC littlestanemone: just good old classic cmc Apr 15, 2007 4:21:44 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: he was looking for attention Apr 15, 2007 4:21:47 PM EDT
CMC dah88: wait i didnt hear this Apr 15, 2007 4:21:50 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yes you did Apr 15, 2007 4:21:57 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Apr 15, 2007 4:21:58 PM EDT
CMC dah88: did i? Apr 15, 2007 4:22:13 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: a kid posted a threat of a shooting for a school, and he got caught by officials on it Apr 15, 2007 4:22:24 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: the kid who posted a threat in a myspace bulletin and his school officials found it and prevented him from carrying it out Apr 15, 2007 4:22:25 PM EDT
CMC dah88: the kid who said he was gonna bring a gun to school? Apr 15, 2007 4:22:27 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yep Apr 15, 2007 4:22:32 PM EDT
CMC dah88: o ok Apr 15, 2007 4:22:34 PM EDT
CMC dah88: well its good that they stopped it Apr 15, 2007 4:23:07 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, that was definitely NOT an invasion of privacy Apr 15, 2007 4:23:32 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:23:38 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats just a kid fishing for a defense for a stupid action Apr 15, 2007 4:23:57 PM EDT
CMC dah88: well, technically it was an invasion, but for a valid reason Apr 15, 2007 4:23:59 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: how was it an invasion? Apr 15, 2007 4:24:26 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but if youre going to post something like that on myspace i guess youre looking for an invasion of privacy Apr 15, 2007 4:24:32 PM EDT
CMC dah88: its his private thoughts no matter what, making it an invasion, but in this case it was justified Apr 15, 2007 4:25:00 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i guess i just dont think he really intended it to be private Apr 15, 2007 4:25:19 PM EDT
CMC dah88: and if you dont want your privacy to be invaded you probably shouldnt post it on the internet Apr 15, 2007 4:25:22 PM EDT
CMC dah88: lol Apr 15, 2007 4:25:23 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yea, exactly Apr 15, 2007 4:25:31 PM EDT
CMC dah88: he couldnt have intended for it to be private Apr 15, 2007 4:25:38 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, nothing on the internet is really private, in the sense of being secure Apr 15, 2007 4:25:46 PM EDT
CMC dah88: anyone can access a myspace Apr 15, 2007 4:25:51 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: wait, so dah Apr 15, 2007 4:26:00 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yea? Apr 15, 2007 4:26:10 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: you're saying that it was an invasion because he may not have intended it to be public? Apr 15, 2007 4:26:18 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (just curious) Apr 15, 2007 4:26:26 PM EDT
CMC dah88: well, if he tried to use invasion of privacy in his defense i guess he was somewhat justified because they read what he posted, but i think hes using that as an excuse Apr 15, 2007 4:27:28 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i cant imagine he would post something on myspace and not expect it to get read Apr 15, 2007 4:27:40 PM EDT
CMC dah88: especially something like that Apr 15, 2007 4:27:48 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:27:56 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:28:06 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well "post" is basically always been used with public display Apr 15, 2007 4:28:20 PM EDT
CMC dah88: thats true Apr 15, 2007 4:28:27 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i mean, any of his friends could have been freaked out by it and showed it to officials... they wouldn't have necessarily even had to go looking Apr 15, 2007 4:28:35 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean a poster...used to show people things....a post on a wall like a flier is used to get people's attention Apr 15, 2007 4:28:39 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i guess it depends how he "posted" it, if it was public then im not sure it counts as being private Apr 15, 2007 4:28:50 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well i think that's probably how it went down Apr 15, 2007 4:28:54 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i dont know a lot about myspace Apr 15, 2007 4:29:03 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, it's not like they hacked in Apr 15, 2007 4:29:06 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: me neither Apr 15, 2007 4:29:08 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: ohh ok Apr 15, 2007 4:29:08 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, so aren't all posts public? Apr 15, 2007 4:29:17 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: a bulletin shows up to every single person you're friends with Apr 15, 2007 4:29:20 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: and thats what he posted Apr 15, 2007 4:29:26 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that's rediculous Apr 15, 2007 4:29:34 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah lol Apr 15, 2007 4:29:37 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: does anyone remember how old the kid was? Apr 15, 2007 4:29:47 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: high school age, right? Apr 15, 2007 4:29:51 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think so Apr 15, 2007 4:30:02 PM EDT
CMC dah88: well in that case, it was meant to only be seen by the people he was friends with, tecnically making it invasion, but its his friends' right to contact authority Apr 15, 2007 4:30:03 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: right, but everyone has access to his account unless it's marked private Apr 15, 2007 4:30:24 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but wait Apr 15, 2007 4:30:26 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yep Apr 15, 2007 4:30:31 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, but if his friends showed somebody, then how is that an invasion Apr 15, 2007 4:30:33 PM EDT
CMC dah88: can people youre not friends with access your myspace page? Apr 15, 2007 4:30:34 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: for instance Apr 15, 2007 4:30:34 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yes Apr 15, 2007 4:30:40 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: they can Apr 15, 2007 4:30:47 PM EDT
CMC dah88: oh then nevermind. Apr 15, 2007 4:30:56 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i've talked with people on IM before, and they've said stuff that's threatened themselves, and i contacted people Apr 15, 2007 4:30:57 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i thought it was like facebook Apr 15, 2007 4:30:59 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: nah, myspace is sketch Apr 15, 2007 4:31:08 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah, his friends def should have contacted someone Apr 15, 2007 4:31:15 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: u can turn it to private tho Apr 15, 2007 4:31:15 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah...it's still a really creepy place, though Apr 15, 2007 4:31:29 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yes, yes it is Apr 15, 2007 4:31:34 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: haha Apr 15, 2007 4:31:35 PM EDT
CMC dah88: its not invasion if they were contacted, it would be invasion maybe if they thought he seemed suspicious and then hacked into it Apr 15, 2007 4:31:48 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well i now think facebook is also since this mark guy owns my pics now apparently Apr 15, 2007 4:31:49 PM EDT
CMC dah88: without anyone contacting them Apr 15, 2007 4:31:59 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i bet there was some sort of incident that preceded it that made officials suspicious Apr 15, 2007 4:32:50 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah...facebook looks nicer, at least Apr 15, 2007 4:32:57 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:32:58 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: otherwise they probably wouldn't have even taken the threat seriously Apr 15, 2007 4:33:02 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: indeed Apr 15, 2007 4:33:07 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, i agree with that Apr 15, 2007 4:33:09 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i'm not sure if this relates to the topic Apr 15, 2007 4:33:41 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but do you guys think that people like peds should get their myspace's frequently checked after their hearing as check ups? Apr 15, 2007 4:34:07 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yes Apr 15, 2007 4:34:20 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (i don't even know if they're allowed to have one after they're convicted, etc.) Apr 15, 2007 4:34:22 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yes i think so Apr 15, 2007 4:34:31 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: if they do, it should be monitored Apr 15, 2007 4:34:33 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but i doubt they would be stupid enough to post threatening things after getting caught Apr 15, 2007 4:34:43 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that would not be an invasion though, because they were already convicted though, right- you guys agree? Apr 15, 2007 4:34:45 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: i don't know that there are any laws related to the internet activity of convicted peds yet Apr 15, 2007 4:34:49 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: true, but some people in this world......stupid Apr 15, 2007 4:34:58 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Apr 15, 2007 4:34:59 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i dont think thats invasion Apr 15, 2007 4:34:59 PM EDT
CMC dah88: aha thats true Apr 15, 2007 4:35:05 PM EDT
CMC dah88: it shouldnt be invasion of privacy if they were conviced, after that pretty much everything you do should be monitered in a sense Apr 15, 2007 4:35:31 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:35:40 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, they're already on a lot of lists Apr 15, 2007 4:35:48 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:35:51 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:35:52 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: they already have a lot of their privacy rights revoked... myspace should be on that list Apr 15, 2007 4:36:00 PM EDT
CMC dah88: its just important that they dont generalize because that person was already conviced Apr 15, 2007 4:36:21 PM EDT
CMC dah88: for example if they read what he said to his friend and he said something like: hey i hate english i could kill my teacher Apr 15, 2007 4:37:04 PM EDT
CMC dah88: or something Apr 15, 2007 4:37:06 PM EDT
CMC dah88: idk if that makes sense Apr 15, 2007 4:37:10 PM EDT
CMC dah88: teenagers tend to use slang that could be considered more dangerous than they mean it to be Apr 15, 2007 4:37:50 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i guess is my point Apr 15, 2007 4:37:53 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats true Apr 15, 2007 4:38:13 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: it all needs to be taken in context Apr 15, 2007 4:38:19 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah exactly Apr 15, 2007 4:38:28 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, and times have changed Apr 15, 2007 4:38:29 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: like, when we were in elementary school, we could threaten to kill somebody, and it wouldn't be taken seriously Apr 15, 2007 4:38:54 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:39:02 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: true dat Apr 15, 2007 4:39:09 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i could yell as a kid, aahhhh i'm gonna kill you, but then columbine hit Apr 15, 2007 4:39:16 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: sadly, yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:39:17 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: or however you spell that Apr 15, 2007 4:39:25 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: so like people like us sometimes slip with that, not saying i do, but some do Apr 15, 2007 4:40:10 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah and once they have something on their record they tend to be assumed guilty Apr 15, 2007 4:40:11 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that should also be taken into consideration...for a certain age group Apr 15, 2007 4:40:21 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: like kids now never say that... Apr 15, 2007 4:40:41 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: that's fair Apr 15, 2007 4:40:45 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah... Apr 15, 2007 4:40:46 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah, thats fair Apr 15, 2007 4:40:54 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i still have friends threaten to shoot me in the face on a regular basis lol Apr 15, 2007 4:41:05 PM EDT
CMC dah88: kind of like how you cant say bomb on an airplane anymore Apr 15, 2007 4:41:07 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i would hate it if they got arrested for it Apr 15, 2007 4:41:11 PM EDT
CMC dah88: teenagers need to curb what they say Apr 15, 2007 4:41:14 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: that's true too Apr 15, 2007 4:42:00 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: going back to what i said earlier...on IM Apr 15, 2007 4:42:10 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: when i talked to a kid, and he made threats actually against himself....and i got older people at the time Apr 15, 2007 4:42:29 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: do you guys think that's an invasion of privacy that i did that Apr 15, 2007 4:42:39 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: nooooo Apr 15, 2007 4:42:49 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: since that was a private conversation between him and myself? Apr 15, 2007 4:42:51 PM EDT
CMC dah88: no Apr 15, 2007 4:42:58 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: dont they tell you to do that? Apr 15, 2007 4:42:59 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: like in school? Apr 15, 2007 4:43:02 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: not really Apr 15, 2007 4:43:08 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: if you think a friend has a problem, bet help Apr 15, 2007 4:43:11 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well i don't remember Apr 15, 2007 4:43:13 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: get* Apr 15, 2007 4:43:13 PM EDT

CMC littlestanemone: haha well we learned that in health Apr 15, 2007 4:43:20 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, that's right Apr 15, 2007 4:43:26 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: same here Apr 15, 2007 4:43:28 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that was before that age though Apr 15, 2007 4:43:34 PM EDT
CMC dah88: thats not invasion of privacy Apr 15, 2007 4:43:55 PM EDT
CMC dah88: if your friend is in trouble you have every right to try to help them Apr 15, 2007 4:44:27 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: right, you were just trying to help Apr 15, 2007 4:44:37 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: true dat...does anybody else have any personal experiences that they can relate to this topic with? Apr 15, 2007 4:44:45 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: not spreading it around the internet or something Apr 15, 2007 4:44:46 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: not really Apr 15, 2007 4:44:55 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: not at all Apr 15, 2007 4:44:59 PM EDT
CMC dah88: no Apr 15, 2007 4:45:01 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, it's not common, lol Apr 15, 2007 4:45:02 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well that's good, but it sucks for the convo Apr 15, 2007 4:45:16 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: lol Apr 15, 2007 4:45:17 PM EDT
CMC dah88: aha Apr 15, 2007 4:45:20 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: we've been talking about this for quite a while lol Apr 15, 2007 4:46:09 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah... Apr 15, 2007 4:46:31 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: 13 more minutes Apr 15, 2007 4:46:43 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: LETS GO TEAM! FEEL THE BURN! Apr 15, 2007 4:46:52 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: or not Apr 15, 2007 4:47:04 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: arrrrgh Apr 15, 2007 4:47:08 PM EDT
CMC dah88: EOOO Apr 15, 2007 4:47:09 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: hahah Apr 15, 2007 4:47:11 PM EDT
CMC dah88: WOO* Apr 15, 2007 4:47:11 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: too much burning... Apr 15, 2007 4:47:11 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: ok so: privacy! Apr 15, 2007 4:47:36 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats a good thing Apr 15, 2007 4:47:41 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: myspace sucks Apr 15, 2007 4:47:44 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: privacy is good. indeed Apr 15, 2007 4:47:47 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: anddddd.... dont post stuff on the internet unless you want people to see it Apr 15, 2007 4:47:56 PM EDT
CMC dah88: esp myspace Apr 15, 2007 4:48:10 PM EDT
Melissa Carbone: where do you think school officials should draw the line? Apr 15, 2007 4:48:12 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but you need to know the line between privacy and well....."internet privacy"....which doesn't exactly exist Apr 15, 2007 4:48:16 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: also true. i think the courts are going to be fighting that one out for the next several years Apr 15, 2007 4:48:41 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: in reality, i don' think that school officials should go on it unless they get a hint towards a threat, etc. Apr 15, 2007 4:48:51 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i think anything that comes into school is no longer private Apr 15, 2007 4:48:54 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: internet privacy is a different story Apr 15, 2007 4:49:00 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah i dont really agree with schools that check kids backpacks every morning when they come in Apr 15, 2007 4:49:13 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: they do that?! Apr 15, 2007 4:49:25 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: well thats ridiculous Apr 15, 2007 4:49:29 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: in some places Apr 15, 2007 4:49:35 PM EDT
CMC dah88: a lot of high schools do Apr 15, 2007 4:49:36 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: wow Apr 15, 2007 4:49:41 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: there would've been a riot at my high school if that happened Apr 15, 2007 4:49:43 PM EDT
CMC dah88: especially after columbine Apr 15, 2007 4:49:43 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: i meant like if they were tipped off, they should have the right to do a search Apr 15, 2007 4:49:52 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i think that's definitely an invasion Apr 15, 2007 4:49:52 PM EDT
CMC dah88: well, it happens more in public schools especially in bad areas Apr 15, 2007 4:49:59 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah... Apr 15, 2007 4:50:03 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i mean Apr 15, 2007 4:50:04 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: sheesh tho Apr 15, 2007 4:50:05 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well they can check the lockers and everything inside them, because that's their space Apr 15, 2007 4:50:20 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:50:27 PM EDT
CMC dah88: and kids that had things like swiss army knives in their bags werent nescessarily going to use them to kill their peers Apr 15, 2007 4:50:33 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: (not myspace...ba dum...symbol crashhhhhhhh) Apr 15, 2007 4:50:34 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: aaaaaaahahahahaha. Apr 15, 2007 4:50:51 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: good one lol Apr 15, 2007 4:50:53 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: that was so bad Apr 15, 2007 4:50:57 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: hahaha Apr 15, 2007 4:51:01 PM EDT
CMC dah88: i think they should only check lockers tho if they have a reason Apr 15, 2007 4:51:43 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: absolutely Apr 15, 2007 4:51:54 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i've heard stories of kids who have gotten suspended for bringing in batteries and some wire because they could make a bomb out of this....the kid was in elementary school.... Apr 15, 2007 4:52:02 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: eww Apr 15, 2007 4:52:08 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats such an overreaction Apr 15, 2007 4:52:15 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: exactly Apr 15, 2007 4:52:19 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:52:21 PM EDT
CMC dah88: there was a boy in our brother high school that fixed peoples ipods Apr 15, 2007 4:52:37 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:52:39 PM EDT
CMC dah88: and he had one in his locker that was reported stolen Apr 15, 2007 4:52:45 PM EDT
CMC dah88: but he was just fixing it for someone he didnt know it was stolen Apr 15, 2007 4:52:54 PM EDT
CMC dah88: and he got kicked out Apr 15, 2007 4:52:56 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: aww Apr 15, 2007 4:53:00 PM EDT
CMC dah88: stuff like that isnt fair Apr 15, 2007 4:53:10 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well that's a private school Apr 15, 2007 4:53:17 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: so you can't do a lot about that Apr 15, 2007 4:53:20 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: but for instance if it was a public school Apr 15, 2007 4:53:28 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah thats true Apr 15, 2007 4:53:51 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: i don't hink that they should necessarily be penalized within the school system for stolen goods, i t hink that the cops should do their job and deal with it Apr 15, 2007 4:53:55 PM EDT
CMC dah88: and also you hear about people "planting" things Apr 15, 2007 4:54:11 PM EDT
CMC dah88: and then no one really knows who to believe Apr 15, 2007 4:54:19 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: yeah, and with a lot of private schools, there aren't locks on the lockers Apr 15, 2007 4:54:27 PM EDT
CMC dah88: exactly Apr 15, 2007 4:54:53 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: thats true Apr 15, 2007 4:54:53 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: or the administrators have access to all the locker combinations Apr 15, 2007 4:55:07 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah thats how it was at my school Apr 15, 2007 4:55:16 PM EDT
CMC dah88: we had to use locks they provided Apr 15, 2007 4:55:22 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: well that's everywhere i thought Apr 15, 2007 4:55:22 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: at least if they're going to enforce their own punishments there should be a thorogh investigation Apr 15, 2007 4:55:26 PM EDT
CMC dah88: and they had all the combos Apr 15, 2007 4:55:26 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah thats how it was with me too Apr 15, 2007 4:55:39 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: but i mean, you shouldnt really bring anything to school you could get in trouble for Apr 15, 2007 4:56:06 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: yeah, you're risking your privacy if you're going to behave stupidly Apr 15, 2007 4:56:28 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: as said before....some people just don't get it and are stupid Apr 15, 2007 4:56:31 PM EDT
CMC dah88: yeah, but at the same time they shouldnt be allowed to check your things unless someone reports that they heard something bad or saw you with something Apr 15, 2007 4:56:39 PM EDT
CMC frogger428: haha, right Apr 15, 2007 4:56:39 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: and especially in well, elementary school, middle, and beginnings of high school....the kids aren't mature enough to realize how dumb it really is Apr 15, 2007 4:57:01 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: yeah Apr 15, 2007 4:57:08 PM EDT
CMC littlestanemone: they should be more lenient then Apr 15, 2007 4:57:13 PM EDT
CMC John_Bastow: some need strict rules, but the majority don't....it just comes down to the system trying to get to a small group of students that aren't any bood Apr 15, 2007 4:57:59 PM EDT
