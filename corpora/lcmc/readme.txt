This folder contains all samples provided by particiipants in the Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) study
      at Loyola College, Maryland. All samples were collected 9/2006 through 12/2007.

All files are in .txt format.  Chat group transcripts also appear in Word format.  

For file naming conventions, giving meaning of digits and letters of the file names,
   see the file FileCodingSchemes3 in this folder.

Correlated folders contain samples of the same partcipants, renumbered 1-21. See Excel spreadsheet PartipantContinuity
   (in this folder) for renumbering mapping.

Extra folders contain samples from participants of Phase 1 or Phase 2 who did not complete all genres.
   In these folders, the original numbering is maintained: files of original participants are named
                      n* where n is the original number of a Phase 1 participant
                or    n*R where n is the number assigned a Phase 2 participant.

See additional readme files in each genre subfolder for more detailed information.
