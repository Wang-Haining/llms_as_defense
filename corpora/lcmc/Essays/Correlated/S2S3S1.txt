	Gender discrimination is not a huge issue in the present-day United States.  While it may have been a larger issue in the past half-century, it does not pose much of a problem to our society today.  In the modernized country we live in, which is the most ethnically spread country in the world, gender differences do not concern the common citizen.  Also, through my own experience, I have never witnessed a situation in which gender discrimination was evident. I have worked for the same company for three years, I have several women and men as bosses, and gender discrimination never occurred.
	Whether or not the common citizen of the United States today would consider gender discrimination a major issue, one fact always boggles me about the entire issue in general.  Men and women are inherently different. Therefore, it would make no sense if we were treated in exactly the same way. For instance, women do not typically play American football, as it is a very physical sport. Since there are a great number of differences between men and women, I would not call it discrimination to acknowledge those differences.
