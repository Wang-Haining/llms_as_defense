	Preventing a school shooting by accessing information from a MySpace bulletin is not an invasion of privacy by any means.  MySpace, along with Yahoo Personals, Facebook, and many other groups, are all public forum-like environments where information is passed amongst hundreds of thousands of internet users.  If someone posts any information on that type of website, he or she is allowing the world to view whatever information that might be.  Therefore, it makes no sense to treat such usage of that information as an invasion of privacy.
	It is difficult to determine where school officials should draw the line as to whether or not they are invading the privacy of their students.  They must determine exactly what type of information is public and which is private.  Any information that is posted in a public environment, such as MySpace, is a legitimate source of information, especially if it means preventing a school shooting.  To deny the use of this information would be like denying a person the right to look up someone’s phone number in the Yellow Pages.  Any person listed in the Yellow Pages has their right to privacy, but they chose to leave their phone information public.  On the other hand, school officials should not delve into the private lives of any students, whether it is through a personal diary, cell phone text message, or crumpled up letter.  Usage of this type of information is morally wrong and a definite invasion of privacy.
