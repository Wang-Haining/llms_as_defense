	When the war in Iraq first began, I fully supported President Bush’s decision to send troops into the country.  With aspirations of toppling an evil dictator and recovering weapons of mass destruction, it seemed that Bush had concrete, noble objectives that were within our reach to achieve.  Both of these objectives came to a climax.  Saddam Hussein was apprehended and put to trial.  However, no weapons of mass destruction were found. Ever since then, the media has mocked Bush each and every day for sending our troops into Iraq.
	At this time, it would be in our country’s best interests to pull out of Iraq.  We have been over there for several years, and even though we have made some progress towards bringing democracy to the people of Iraq, the development is coming to a screeching halt.  My brother joined the Marine Corps after the war started, and he has already returned from his second tour of duty there.  However, many of our soldiers are not as fortunate as my brother.  Every day we hear of more and more casualties.  This continuous, fruitless war, with fighting that leads to more deaths and less progress, is drastically hurting the morale of our nation at a time when we need it most.  We need to accept the fact that even though we have captured Saddam Hussein, the people of Iraq are not going to change.
