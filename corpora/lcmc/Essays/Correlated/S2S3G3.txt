	Gay marriage should be legalized in every state.  It is wrong to discriminate against someone for any reason, especially if that reason is not under his or her control.  Many people say that homosexuals are just confused or sick with a disease and they can choose to be straight.  Logically, that is completely ridiculous.  No person would ever voluntarily submit themselves to the pain and anguish a homosexual and his or her family inevitably goes through when that person finally “comes out of the closet.”  This pain is caused by the media and its everyday assistance in painting an embarrassing picture of homosexuals in general.  Therefore, no person holds the right to label a couple’s love for one another as wrong simply because both members of the couple are of the same sex.
	Furthermore, the Federal government should have no say regarding a couple’s right to marriage.  Marriage is neither a legal nor moral concern, nor is it a matter of national security.  It is a right that any two people should have to graft their lives together in a beautiful act of love for one another.  To deny someone’s right to marriage is a violation of their rights as a human being.  Unless the government can present a legitimate reason for the banning of gay marriage, it should be legalized in every state in this country.
