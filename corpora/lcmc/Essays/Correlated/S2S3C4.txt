	The Catholic Church should adapt to life in the 21st Century with some very important and worthwhile changes.  While it is hard to make changes to traditions that seem as permanent as Catholicism itself, there would be many advantages to adopting certain new practices.  For example, with regards to pedophilia amongst priests, if the Catholic Church allowed priests to marry, this would greatly lessen the amount of pedophilic incidents.  Also, since the Church is experiencing a continuous shortage of priests, allowing females priestesses would help solve this problem.
	Even though the Church could use many changes in our modern times, this does not lessen the massive amount of good the Church bestows on our world.  It is unfair for the media to expound the pedophilia within the Church when, really, it only occurred amongst a very low number of priests.  There is no doubt that pedophilia is a sickening crime that should be fought at every turn.  Nevertheless, there are thousands of good, innocent men out there who have contributed their lives to God for noble causes, and it is wrong to undermine the efforts of these men and lessen our view of the Catholic Church in general.
