	The legalization of marijuana is a wonderful idea for a variety of reasons.  First of all, crime would drop dramatically.  In places like Amsterdam and Canada, where limited amounts of marijuana are legal, crime rates are extremely low.  Also, jails in our country would have more space for criminals more at fault then a person with a marijuana problem who is otherwise innocent.  Aside from these reasons, if marijuana were legal, the government could tax it and help our country move out of the economic secession we have fallen into over the past several years.
	Marijuana effects are very similar, if not less dangerous, than the effects of alcohol.  While marijuana has no scientifically proven negative side effects, the negative side effects of alcohol are numerous.  Also, many people I know would smoke marijuana and drive a car with full confidence but would never get behind the wheel after having a single drink.  If an intoxicating substance as dangerous as alcohol is fully legal after 18 or 21, marijuana should be as well.
