	Gender discrimination is more commonly associated with the past, when peoples roles in life were defined by their gender.  Nowadays, it easier for women to hold professional positions, and there are men who run their households.  That is not to say, however, that the problem of gender discrimination has been eliminated.  While it is possible for people today to break through the boundaries imposed by gender discrimination, those boundaries still exist in a very real way.   Stereotypical gender roles are still prevalent, and women are often discriminated against in the workplace and in traditionally male settings.  There is also a less significant issue of men being discriminated against in traditionally female roles.  Overall, a lot of gender discrimination still exists in the present-day United States, to which there is no simple solution.
	Solving the problem of gender discrimination is no easy task.  It will of course take much to time to completely even out the expectations for males and females, and it may not even be achievable given the United States’ past history of unequal gender roles.  The best thing to do is to encourage men and women who take on positions and tasks typically designated for the opposite sex.  Only with widespread acceptance of such actions will they become the norm, which is necessary to eliminate gender discrimination.  It is important to try to separate a role from a gender, so that it becomes accepted for any role to be played by any individual regardless of gender, which is what it means to be free of gender discrimination.  There is a long way to go to solve the problem of gender discrimination, but hopefully the conscious efforts that people make to accept untraditional roles will contribute to the elimination of such a negative force that shapes society.
