	I absolutely support the legalization of marijuana. The reality is, pot, in many ways, is no different from alcohol. In fact, it’s probably safer simply because you can’t kill yourself from overdosing, the way you can with alcohol and many other drugs. Certainly there are risks to using any drug, and there would have to be restrictions put upon activities such as driving, but allowing the use of a small amount of legalized pot would do the world no harm.
	 I have a personal interest in marijuana being legalized. A majority of my close and lasting friendships, from high school through to college, began, or were nurtured, through a common bond: marijuana. I’ve met a lot of people after someone asks the question, “hey, want to smoke?” Some might consider this shallow, and my friendships 
unhealthy, but the reality is, I’ve never met a group of people as close as my friends. We’ve stuck together through break ups and people moving away, through college and 
fights. I can go to any of my close friends for advice on anything, and we can talk intelligently about sports, politics, philosophy, and a whole number of things. If given 
the chance, we could certainly disprove many misconceptions people may have about youth who smoke marijuana. 
	 Marijuana should be legalized because its affects are similar, and probably milder, than those of alcohol. Marijuana cannot directly kill you, unlike alcohol. And 
although I have not personally driven stoned, many of my friends do so on a regular basis and have never once encountered any problems. Marijuana is a social drug, just like alcohol. My best friendships have been born from a common interest: smoking pot. All of us are attending major universities of repute, all of us excel in athletics or 
academics, and none of us have ever been imprisoned or reprimanded for any sort of misbehavior. Marijuana, in moderate amounts, would be great for American society. We 
all need to loosen up a bit.
