	On a personal level I do not agree with the war anymore. At first right after 9/11 I felt like the war was justified and it needed to happen because we needed to let the world know that those kinds of actions against America would not go unpunished. Through the years I have become increasingly less supportive of the war for the sheer fact that I feel it is a fight we can not win. The Iraqi people do not want to help; how do you help people who do not want your help in the first place. Now I feel like the Iraqi war should end as soon as possible and America should just cut it losses and just let them take their own course. 
	 It would be in the best interest of the country, I feel if they were to pull out of the war in Iraq. In the beginning the War in Iraq and the war of Terror I felt were both good things not only for the country but for the world. Without Saddam in power the world instantly became a better place, but the problem is that the people who lived under Saddam do not want our help. So why are we offering it? 
	In the end I feel like it is a problem that just needs to take its course. It is not something that we as Americans can fix mostly because we don’t not understand their culture or why they do things as a whole. We need to sit back and let the Iraqi people to live their lives and I feel in the end everything that is going on in Iraq will be straightened out by them.
