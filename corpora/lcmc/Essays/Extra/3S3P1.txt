	I do not believe that the who school officials prevented a school shooting because one of the shooters posted a myspace bulletin were invading the student’s privacy in any way. In fact, I think it is a blessing that these officials were able to see this student’s bulletin and were able to stop him before anything bad were to happen. I also believe that posting your personal thoughts on a web page for everyone to see is negating your own privacy so the student was at fault to begin with.
	I think that in this case, the student officials did the right thing by reading the student’s bulletin and taking actions on what they said. What the student was planning on putting the lives of everyone in the building in danger. It directly involved the school and the had every right to step forward and take action. If they didn’t stop the student from what he was planning to do, who knows how many people would have been injured, or hurt even worse. And if the school officials knew this was going to happen and didn’t take action, then bigger problems would have in sued. 
	The student should have also realized that by posting this on a web page, any person in the world who owns a computer would be able to view it. The student was foolish for thinking that they would be able to post a bulletin like this and would get away with it and not be stopped. I’m not sure if it was a student who first saw the message and then reported it to officials or if they officials saw it first hand while looking at students pages, but either way, both were at liberty to see it. If the student had used common sense he would have realized that anyone who reads about something that would potentially endanger their life, they would do anything in their ability to change it.
	I think that there is a line where school officials would have to draw when it comes to students’ privacy. If school officials were to hear about two students that are in a fight and were planning to physically resolve in the school area or during the school day, they would have the right to step in and prevent the fight from happening. But if the students were just having a verbal spat via internet and had no intention of bringing it into the school building, then I don’t think that the officials would have the right to stop the fight, and it would be considered and invasion of privacy. Also if the school officials were to hear about a party that was going on during a weekend night where students would be in attendance, I don’t believe that they would have the right to call a parent, or talk to the student holding the party. I believe that that would be an invasion of privacy. No person who is not involved in the party would be getting hurt. For the students who are attending, it is their own personal choice and are responsible for their actions at the party.
	I definitely think that there are some lines when it comes to students’ privacy. If uninvolved parties are in danger, then I think the school officials have the right to step in and it would not be considered an invasion of privacy. But if other parties would not be affected, then I don’t believe they would have the right to step in. But in the case of the student who posted  a bulletin saying he was going to bring a gun to school, the school officials had every right to step in and it was not considered and invasion of privacy.
