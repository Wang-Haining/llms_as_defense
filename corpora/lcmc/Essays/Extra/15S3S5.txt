I think that discrimination of any sort, especially gender discrimination, is still an issue in the United States.  While feminists are not necessarily as vocal as they were in years past, there is still much that needs to be done for true gender equality.  Few people realize that the true, original meaning of feminism is not necessarily the militant bra-burning “empowered” woman, but a philosophy that is striving towards equality for both genders.

In the workplace, both women and men are often victims of discrimination.  There is always sexual discrimination, which often springs to mind, but fewer people realize that one's gender plays a role in being hired in the first place.  There is still the idea of “quotas”, where a more well-qualified man will be rejected for a job if a woman applies for it as well, simply to meet a diversity percentage.  Sexual harassment figures are also heavily skewed, because it is commonly believed that men cannot be sexually harassed-- so they do not report any incidents that they have been involved in.

Really, the only thing that can be done for such a huge social issue is to raise awareness.  This can and should start as early as childhood, even in something as simple as going against the traditional McDonald's boys' Hot Wheels and girls' Barbies toys.  It is much easier to instill tolerance at a young age than it is to go back and have to re-teach it to someone who sterotypes.  The culture is getting better with this-- the past few weeks in the city, I've seen several ads encouraging parents to teach their children tolerance.  This should continue, and with even more force, if we hope to ever live in a society where all people truly are treated equally.
