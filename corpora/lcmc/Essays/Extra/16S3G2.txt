	Honestly I feel that the states that are still opposed to gay marriage need to re-evaluate what it means to be married. I feel that being married only means that you want to join your love with another person under the law. Why is it that heterosexual couple have the right to join the love for eternity but homosexuals are not allowed to do the same thing. All the states who still oppose need to realize that there is truly nothing wrong with gay marriage and they should let it take place. For people who say it is against there religion, they need to understand that religions chose to recognize any marriages they want. If they do not want to recognize gay marriages then they don’t have to. America is a place where all races, genders, and religions are tolerated. If you understand this why would gay marriage also be legal?
	I feel like President Bush’s amendment to ban gay marriage is in itself unconstitutional and should not be pushed through the house or the senate.  The federal government should not be allowed to influence, or have any say on this decision. The real question is why is it illegal in the first place?
	I think in the long run it would be better for society if we allowed gay marriage. I think it would be an overall feeling that with more people being happy cause they can do as they wish there lives it will be better for the country. I already feel that the country has to much control over the population; this is the land of the free and everyday I feel like we lose another part of our freedom. If we allowed gay marriage it would have no affect on the already existing laws that the country has so why not allow it? 
	In the end I think people in the United States will come around and so will the government and eventually gay marriage will not only be legal but it will be looked upon the same way as a regular heterosexual marriage would be.
