	Marijuana has long been used as a prescription drug to help treat various symptoms for patients. I think that the city of Denver has seen that Marijuana has not caused any disruptions within their society and they have chosen to legalize it to gain some type of added revenue on its sale. I do not know the effects of marijuana, however I am sure that the city of Denver must have good cause to legalize it sale and usage.
