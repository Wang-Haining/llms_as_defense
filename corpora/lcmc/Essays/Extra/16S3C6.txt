	I feel like there are many things that the church does not have to do to change and adapt to life in the twenty first century. For the most part I feel like the Catholic Church does not need to change its ways. It is an institution that has exists for almost two thousand years based off of the same basic principles and morals. Why should they have to change the way they conduct their faith and some of the beliefs and foundations of it just to fit people of today? The one thing that I feel they should change is that they should allow priest to get married that is something that I never really understood in the first place because matrimony is one of the most sacred sacraments of the Catholic religion and it brings you closer to achieving the ultimate good which is a relationship with god. So why would not the Catholic Church want their most holy of people to be closer to god?
	There only thing the church could have done to prevent those acts of pedophiliac from occurring would have been to set guidelines that priest were not allowed to be with little children alone in the same room. By letting priest get married it would have done nothing because being a pedophiliac is not something that being married would cure. It means that something is seriously wrong with the person who has the problem and they need to be helped mentally. Allowing female priest would not fix this problem either. That has nothing do with being a pedophiliac. 
	In the end I feel like the Catholic Church mostly does not have any changes to make to fit the people of today, if anything people need to change to fit the Catholic Church. Although I do feel like priest should be allowed to marry.
