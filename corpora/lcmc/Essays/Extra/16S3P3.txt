	I do not feel like checking a myspace to prevent a school shooting is an invasion of privacy. This is mainly because myspace is a public site that anyone can use and access as long as they have an email address. If you put something on the internet then you have to come to the facts that someone might see what is up there. For now the internet is free and anyone can access it so how is it an invasion of privacy to look at someone’s myspace and stop something horrible from happening. School officials should use the same laws that police use in terms of violating privacy. As long as the school is not breaking any constitutional rights or any laws then what they do is fair, especially in the effort to make sure that the kids in the school are safe.
	There is nothing private about the internet. If you look at this problem that took place in the Denver School you can also apply it to companies now who are using things like Facebook and Myspace to do semi background checks on college students who apply for jobs. Although I do not feel like is right to not hire a person because of something they see on one of those websites, you must take in account that it us up there and it can be seen by whoever wants so if you want to make sure that something like that would affect you getting a job then you must not allow things like that to be on the internet.
	In the end I feel that what the Denver School system was right and they should continue to do it to ensure the safety of the children who go to school there.
