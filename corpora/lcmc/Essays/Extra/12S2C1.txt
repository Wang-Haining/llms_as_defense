	I do not feel that the Catholic Church has to change in order to adapt to the 21st Century. The church made a great effort at modernization in the 20th Century with the Vatican II council. I feel that the morals and values that the Catholic Church offer will be look to for guidance as we enter the 21st Century. The Catholic Church had to also adapt to the recent scandal associated to priests. This scandal has been enhanced by the media coverage it has received and only occurred in a small minority of priests within the Catholic Church.
