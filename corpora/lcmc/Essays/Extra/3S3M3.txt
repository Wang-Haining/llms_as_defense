	I believe that the legalization of marijuana in Denver is a good idea and that it should be legalized throughout the country. I think after recent reports that have come out that prove marijuana is not a gateway drug, that the laws about it and views on the use of it should start to change. I also think that like other drugs, such as alcohol, their should be rules for the buying, selling, and use of marijuana. I also think that marijuana should be made legal because of its affect on the user and other people as compared to other drugs.
	First off, I think that having an age limit of 21 is a good idea. I think that making it any lower would cause problems would cause problems with the age limit for alcohol. Second, I think that marijuana should be sold like alcohol is: only in stores. I think that government run stores that sell marijuana would help reduce the negative reputation that marijuana and the use of it has. People buying marijuana would be carded, just like those who buy alcohol, and a limit on how much is sold to each customer should be enforced as well. It should be a number small enough that the buyer would not have the intention to sell it to other people. I think that by having marijuana available in stores would eliminate drug deals which, I believe, is the biggest problem that is caused by marijuana. It would eliminate the fights and other dangerous and violent acts caused by drug deals. I also think that like alcohol, a person who has used marijuana and still feels high should not get behind the wheel of a car under any circumstance. 	
	I believe that marijuana should be legalized, because compared to other drugs it has much less harmful effects. Statistics have proven that alcohol has caused harm to many more people than marijuana has. Accidents caused by drunk drivers far surpass the number of accidents caused by drivers who have smoked marijuana. People become violently sick, and even have to go to a hospital to be treated for alcohol poisoning when they have drank too much; it is extremely rare for a person to become sick after smoking marijuana or go to the hospital because the drug itself has affected a person badly. Most importantly, thousands and thousands of people die each year from alcohol poisoning caused by an over consumption of alcohol; there has been no reported cases of death caused from an overdose of marijuana. Alcohol is clearly a more dangerous drug then marijuana is and yet, it is legal. Most people couldn’t imagine a place where people can buy and consume marijuana with other people for recreational use. Yet, that is exactly what a bar is, except with the drug being alcohol.  I think that when compared to alcohol, there is no question that marijuana is much safer. The real question is how could alcohol, the more dangerous drug, be legal when marijuana isn’t?
