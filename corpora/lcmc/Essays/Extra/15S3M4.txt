I feel that marijuana and its effects are similar enough to alcohol and, in fact, cigarettes, that it should be legal.  If it were legalized and federally controlled, several health issues inherent with marijuana would be completely taken out of consideration.

The risks of cigarettes and alcohol are quite similar to marijuana-- not to mention, cigarettes contain nicotine, a drug that is habit-forming.  Marijuana is not habit-forming, by contrast, and it seems questionable that something much more harmful, such as cigarettes, would be legalized for those over the age of 18, while marijuana is not.  It is also interesting how it seems that there is much more of a social stigma attached to the use of marijuana, continually renewed by the so-called “stoner culture”; whereas the common cultural view of those who drink or smoke cigarettes is more “manly”, “sexy”, or “adult”.

How often does one read about someone overdosing on alcohol, getting alcohol poisoning and becoming comatose or even dying?  There are no such overdoses for marijuana use.  Responsible use of marijuana also has health benefits, such as relieving eye pressure in glaucoma patients.  Alcohol in moderation also has health benefits-- most commonly, a daily glass of red wine is beneficial for the heart.    It seems quite silly, frankly, that marijuana is still illegal in most places while much more harmful substances are legal and embraced by our culture..
