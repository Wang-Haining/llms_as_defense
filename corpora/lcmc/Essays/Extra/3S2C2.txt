I believe that they would increase their number in followers if they were to make themselves more appealing to modern day times. I believe that these changes would start in what they teach and how they do it.
	The Bible is the staple book that all Catholics follow and are told to live by. But the Bible was written almost two thousand years ago, and it goes without saying that things have changed since that time. Some people consider the Bible to be “outdated” and that there is no way its teaching can pertain to our world today. That is why I think that the Catholic Church should make its first change with the Bible. I’m not saying that they should change the writing, though, but how they teach it. I think that Catholics should say, “This is what the Bible says, this is how they tell you to live, but if you were to choose a different way, that is ok”. To elaborate on this further, I will take one teaching of the Catholic Church that many people are against: that you should not have sex before marriage. In this day and age, most people have engaged in sexual intercourse with before they are married. For married couples, most have had sex before they were married, and, most likely, with others before. These people are also Catholic and feel that when they go to Church, they are being persecuted for doing wrong, when they believe that what they are doing is perfectly alright. This has made some people turn away from Catholicism and stop attending mass. I think that the Church should say that it is okay for two people to have sexual intercourse as long as they love each other. I do not believe that they should accept promiscuity but as long as the sexual act is considered making love, I think that it should be accepted. I think that this change would make attract more people to the Catholic Church because they wouldn’t be committing a sin every time they have sex with someone they love. 
	I don’t think that the Catholic Church should allow priests to have wives. The oath of celibacy has existed among priests since the beginning of the Church. These men have freely dedicated their lives to God and their greatest love it to be with God. I think that if any of the men who want to become priests aren’t positive that they could live like this, I don’t think that they should become priests. They chose to become priests on their own free will and have taken a vow and if they choose to break it then it is no one’s fault but their own. 
	In conclusion, I believe that there are some thing that the Catholic Church needs to change; basically, they need to modernize to fit in today’s world.
