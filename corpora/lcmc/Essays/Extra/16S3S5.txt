	I feel that gender discrimination is definitely still an issue in the United States today. I can speak from personal experience on this topic. I am Cuban and my mother has regularly been discriminated against not only for being Cuban but also for being a woman. In today’s workplace were they saying it is no longer a male dominated society, I feel like it definitely still is. I can honestly say that I am not one to discriminate people by their gender but I know plenty of people who would. The main problem is that it still does exist in a world today where even women could play in the NFL if they were qualified to do so. There has never been a law against women playing in the NFL ever in its history. 
	There really is nothing that we can do change this as individuals. There may be things as a society that we could. For example, we could at least try it is a national movement to persuade other people to do it, to stop from doing it. This really is the only thing that we can do. This is because gender discrimination is something that is done on a personal level not really on a national level as a whole. The reason the problem exist is because of individuals who feel women neither are nor equal to men. 
	I feel like women are definitely discriminated against in the workplace, but again like I said its not a 100 percent chance that it is going to occur. For men I would say that nearly all men can say that men are not discriminated against in the workplace. I have never been discriminated against in the workplace. Although men aren’t discriminated in the work place just because they are men I feel like racial discrimination is still a problem in the United States also.
