	The war in Iraq is a necessary war that if not fought would encourage more terrorism. Terrorism in the Middle East has affected almost every country and needs to be prevented. Our government is trying to prevent terrorism before it reaches our soil. It is a shame that our soldiers have to be sent half way around the world and in horrible conditions, but their bravery is saving countless number of lives here at home.
