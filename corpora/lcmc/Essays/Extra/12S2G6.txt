	The legalization of gay marriage is a controversial topic that has consumed the thoughts of our politicians, state law-makers, and other people involved in policy making for many years. The state also has tried to distance itself from the affairs of religious organizations. I feel that this issue should not really be decided by the state; rather religious organizations should decide whether they condone gay marriage.
