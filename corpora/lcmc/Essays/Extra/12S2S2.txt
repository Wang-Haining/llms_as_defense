	Gender discrimination is not as big of a problem in this country as it ever used to. Today most all business’ and organizations encourage people of different gender and ethnicities to apply themselves and be as much of a business or organization as everyone else. Equality is a huge aspect of our society and economy and I feel that gender discrimination can be considered at the most an extremely small problem that effects a fraction of our society.
