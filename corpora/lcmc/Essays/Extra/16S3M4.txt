	If the city of Denver legalized marijuana use for people over the age of 21 I feel like it something that is alright. I do not see many differences that exist between marijuana use and alcohol use. If you were to evaluate the side affects of both they have similar affects on the body, if not marijuana has less of an affect. When you look at it this way you start to wonder why marijuana is illegal and alcohol is legal for people over the age of 21. 
	If the government applied the same laws that they already have in place for alcohol to marijuana use I feel like that would sufficient in making it legal. The only obvious difference they would have to make is instead of having a BAC like alcohol does, they could just make driving will under the influence of marijuana is illegal completely. That would be sufficient enough I feel.
	Also if they were to go ahead and make marijuana legal all over the United States it would also lower the amount of drug charges in the United States significantly. I do not know this for a fact but I feel like most people who are arrested and imprisoned for drug use have to do with the use of marijuana. So not only would it be better for the people who use it now illegally, it would also be better for all those people who are already in trouble for it. 
	In the ling run if marijuana was made legal it would definitely have a positive affect on society, and I think some day in the future it will definitely be legal to use.
