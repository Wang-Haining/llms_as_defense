I am all for gay rights. They should have every right that any
heterosexual person has. However, marriage is a sacrament of the Church; a
spiritual bond between a man and a woman recognizable by God through the
eyes of the Church. It is not that the Church does not accept gay people,
it does not look favorably on gay acts hence the fact that they would not
support gay marriage. I do not support gay marriage but I do support gays
being together like a married couple. They just have to use a different
word besides marriage. I do not understand why it is important for the gay
community to be "married" in the eyes of the Church, an institution that
has made it clear that they do not support their way of life. The states
that have legalied gay marriage I think are over stepping their bounds. I
think this is between the gay community and the Church not Bush and not
the States. I think Bush should have nothing to do with this issue. He is
imposing his personal views on the subject on the entire country which is
wrong and unjust. Gay marriage has nothing to do with the federal
government. However, if the gay community decided to use another word and
be recognized by the state as a couple, then I think it would be alright
for the State to step in and legalize it or not legalize it and for the
Federal Gov to support it or not.
