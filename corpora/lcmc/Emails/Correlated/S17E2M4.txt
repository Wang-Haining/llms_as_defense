I think the legalization of marijuana would be an unwise decision.  Marijuana is a harmful, addictive drug that even if used in small quantities can cause many health problems.  Most importantly, marijuana is the gateway drug to more serious, dangerous drugs.  Most people who use illegal substances use them as a result of their previous marijuana.  Legalizing marijuana would only put more people in the downward spiral of addiction by making the drug more easily available.  Marijuana is much more addictive than alcohol and leads to other drug use, unlike alcohol, so it is reasonable for alcohol to be legal and marijuana to be illegal.  One of the main problems in enforcing a law like the one in Denver is limiting the legal quantity of marijuana and defining small.  Overall, it would be best to keep marijuana illegal and avoid the problems associated with this harmful drug.
