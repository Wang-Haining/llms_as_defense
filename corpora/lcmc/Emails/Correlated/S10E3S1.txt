I do feel as though gender discrimination is still very much a part of our scociety today.  Men still have the inner path to success weather our coorporations want to admit it or not.  The sporting world also sees a great deal of gender descrimination.  Women sports do not get as much regognition national or globaly.  Women athletes only make a small percentage of what men athletes make and in individual sports such as tennis or golf the winners of the LPGA and womens tennis events often take home much smaller winnings than that or their male counterparts.  Women have been given a disadavantage in the working world that stems back for centuries, however, now more than ever the tides of change have been rolling in.  It is my belief that within the next 20 years women will share in equall oppertunities that men do within coorprate america. 
     As for reverse gender descrimination, I feel as though it is only present in certain professions such as nursing.  As many movies like to portray, nursing used to be a female dominated profession.  It still is a female heavy job but it does employ many men now.
