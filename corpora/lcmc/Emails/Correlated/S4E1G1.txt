    While gay marriage is a touchy political subject, I don't understand why some people are so opposed to it.  Their main argument against gay marriage is that it corrupts the American family unit.  To this, I say: Look at all the married couples who get divorced – the American family unit is far from perfect.  I think allowing two people of the same sex to marry would actually reduce rates.  This is because gay people currently have to endure so many hardships if they want to get married.  If they choose to get married, or seek marriage, they will have to face a lot of criticism from outside sources.  As a result, gay couples will be less likely to get married on a whim, as many straight couples undeniably do.
    If people learn one thing during their time on earth, I think it should be that all people are different.  Homosexuality is not a "life choice."  Gay people are simply attracted to the same sex.  True, they comprise the minority of the population when it comes to sexual orientation, but society should still accept homosexuality for what it is.
    If gay marriage does become legal, who is it going to hurt.  You are going to see gay couples anywhere you go, so you can't escape reality.  Gays aren't out to take over the world, they simply want to have the same rights as heterosexuals.  To make them a separate class of individuals is cowrdly and childish.  It's the year 2006.  We need to accept people for who they are.
    My uncle is gay, and he is just like everybody else (except his sexual orientation).  My take on the whole gay marriage situation is:  It's not that big of a deal.  If two people want to get married- let them.  End of story.
