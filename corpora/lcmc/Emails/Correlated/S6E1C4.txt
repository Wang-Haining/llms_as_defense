Dear CMC Study,

As with any institution that's been around for millenia (okay, granted, that's the only one I can think of offhand), the Catholic Church is essentially a conservative body which resists any change. This can be seen as a blessing and a curse, but lately it's mostly been a curse. The concerns that the Church served through its current structure died out over a hundred years ago, and relatively little has been done to make that structure relevant since. In order for it to stay alive through the 21st century, I think some major changes are needed. 
I think allowing priests to marry and ordaining female priests would be a step in the right direction, if not the end in itself. The Church is set up like a self-monitering fraternity right now, and as we've seen that hasn't worked out too well (and hasn't prove nearly as funny as, say, "Animal House").

Quick Handy-dandy Guide to becoming a married Catholic Priest:
1. Get married.
2. Attend an Anglican or Episcopalian seminary and become ordained into
one of those sects.
3. Several months later, experience a "conversion" and decide you want to become a Catholic.
4. Because of the preponderance of doctrinal similarities between the sects, the Catholic Church will accept you, marriage and all, as a full-fledged priest in the Roman Catholic Church.

I just thought I'd throw that in.

Peace,
