Stupid debates like gay marriage and abortion are doing nothing but
stalling our political process, hogging media attention, and distracting
us from policy areas where our priorities should really be.  I think this
is beacuse of a "perfect storm" of political factors: a fervent religious
right which is essentially drunk with idealism, a partisan political
system which exploits the "drunk" religious righters for its own benefit,
and a media which largely does the same, fanning the flames.

If you really think marriage should be exclusively between a man and a
woman, that's cool, you are entitled to your opinion.  Lets' just not call
it marriage, lets call it a civil union.  If two men or two women are in
love, they should be able to visit each other in the hospital.  They
should be able to co-sign a mortgage.  I would even go so far as to say
that they should be able to recieve the tax benefits which married couples
recieve.

so lets just not call it gay "marriage", lets call it a civil union, an
enjoining, a happy magical pony ceremony, I don't really care, as long as
it isn't marriage, can't everyone just be happy with it?

Come on Christians, actually show some love for all people, and stop
getting your kicks by condemning others!!
