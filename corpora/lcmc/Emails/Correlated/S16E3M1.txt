I have written about this topic twice already, chatted about it online,
participated in group discussions, and recorded a telephone "monologue"
about it.  I'm probably going to restate almost exactly what I've already
written at least four times.

Okay, so the moral implications of legalizing (or even wide-spread
decriminalization) marijuana aren't really something the US is ready to
deal with.  I feel like the illegality of marijuana contributes to its
novelty in the eyes of adolescents and teenagers, and if it were to all of
a sudden become legal, they simply wouldn't be able to handle themselves. 
There would be no sense of moderation, there would just be a "wahoo! pot
is legal!" craze in middle schools and high schools across the nation. 
This wouldn't be good for anyone.

However, conversely, the illegality of marijuana costs a great deal to
federal, state, and municipal legal systems each year.  When it comes to
cost-cutting and political budget-balancing, I'm sure we could find better
places to cut expenditures than the illegality of marijuana.  However, the
prospect is there, and with a national debt hovering at around $30,000 per
citizen, this detail seems a bit more relevant.

All in all, I don't think marijuana should be legalized.  However, if
cancer patients want to smoke it, let them smoke it.  They are dying of
cancer.
