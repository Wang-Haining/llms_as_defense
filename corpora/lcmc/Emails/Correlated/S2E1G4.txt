    I think gay marriage should be legalized in all states. Some argue that gay marriage undermines the sacredness of marriage in general. However, I believe that two people, regardless of gender, can faithfully devote themselves to each other if they truly love one another.
    I do not think the government has any authority in deciding who can and can not get married. The only arguments against gay marriage are all based on opinion. No legitimate, objective reasons for making it illegal have been put forth, and that is why the federal government should have no say in the matter.
