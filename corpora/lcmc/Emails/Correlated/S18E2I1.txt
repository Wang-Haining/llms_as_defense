The war in Iraq is the hardest issue for me to comment on, due to my lack of knowledge of what exactly is happening overseas.  I think the general public as a whole, no matter what they think they know, isn't aware of most the details of the Iraq War.  There has to be some discretion on the matter - the government has to keep some information private for the sake of national security.  However, in the post 9-11 days it was uniformly decided to invade Afghanistan, and after the general public lost interest, somehow we slipped into Iraq.  There are very many reasons that Saddam should have been taken out of power (namely the violent atrocities he performed on his people), but I'm not sure if it was our place to do it.  Finally, I don't know if I can support a war where we can't see any end, but kids younger than me are dying.
