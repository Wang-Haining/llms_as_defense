I believe that the war in Iraq has had both positive and negative effects on our country, but I think that if we ended the war right now and removed our troops we would just be creating more problems for the people in Iraq that we are trying to help. I have a friend who fought last summer in Iraq. He saw many people die, and saw many terible things but he also helped alot of people. I believe what we are doing for Iraq is good, and needs to continue. They will not be able to achieve what they want without our help.
