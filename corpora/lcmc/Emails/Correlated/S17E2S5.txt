Gender discrimination is still a big issue in the present-day United States.  It is hard to ever fully recover from a great disparity.  Just as African Americans were once oppressed and continue to face discrimination, so will women have a difficult time being seen as equals to their male counterparts.  With a history of inferiority, women still remain somewhat inferior to men, in the workplace and outside the workplace.  More college graduates are female than male, yet men hold higher paying positions on average.  This discrepancy is the result of years of gender discrimination, and it would be hard to deny that this discrimination is still an issue today.  Men are sometimes discriminated against as well, but not in the workplace.  They would face challenges when attempting to take on a traditionally female role, such as that of the homemaker or caretaker of children.  Both men and women face discrimination because the genders, even in modern America, are not viewed as equal and still tend to define roles and jobs.  This is a difficult problem to fix, and it will take a long time to overcome traditional views of gender inequality.  The best thing to do is keep an open mind about the roles of men and women and challenge others to do the same.
