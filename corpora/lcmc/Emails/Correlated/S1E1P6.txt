This is a hard example of privacy rights because on one hand I want to say that school officials should not invade privacy through myspace and facebook among other things. But in this case, the school officials seeing the bulletin prevented a terrible thing from happening. I think that it is an invasion of privacy to go looking at things with the intent to get people in trouble, however if something is brought to their attention they shoul be able to look at it. Anything that you would not want an administrator to see should not be on the internet where anyone can see it.
