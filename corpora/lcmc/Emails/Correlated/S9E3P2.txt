Any material that any person posts on the world wide web is no longer private property.  It's as simple as that.  Anyone has the right to look at someone else's web page or myspace page.  This is one of the things clearly mentioned in by the myspace creators when a person creates an account: the web is not secure and the information that you post will be available for everyone to see.

School officials have the same rights as everyone else, and therefore they had evey right to look at the student's myspace.  Whenever a school official receives any kind of information or indication of violence it must be investigated.  The purpose of the school is to educate its students.  But how can the sudents learn unless they feel safe in their environment.  Therefore one of the top priorities of the school has to be safety, and this priority is vastly more important than the individual privacy rights of the students.  That is why school officials are allowed to search students' lockers (lockers which are school property after all).
