    If one school shooting was prevented by delving a little into someone's myspace, that is enough justification for the action. I do not think reading a post that a person intentionally put up on the internet is an invasion of that person's privacy by any means. However, if someone uses illegitimate means to collect information that was never permissably released by the person being researched, that is a breach of privacy. School officials should not attempt to access private information about any student. On the other hand, any publicly posted information (such as myspace, facebook, etc.), in my opinion, can be legitimately used for any good reason by anyone.
