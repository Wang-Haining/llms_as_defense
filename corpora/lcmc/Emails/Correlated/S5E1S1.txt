I do not feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the present day United States. This may be because I have not been out into the "real world". I held a part time job in high school for 5 years and the only time I felt singled out as a girl was when I was unable to work past 7 o'clock. There were two valid reasons that I was not allowed- first, I think 14 year olds are only allowed to work a certain number of hours, and my boss did not want to leave me alone with the older boys working there..because after hours our store was dead! (I'm glad I had that restriction!) Once I became a freshman in high school I was able to work the rest of the night. At this job, I actually felt that the guys were discriminated..girls never got in trouble. The same mistake could be made by both a guy and a girl, and the guy would get fired. Once again..this was my store-very different from most. I mean...I guess I have been taught that there is discrimination towards women..I don't know by who, but I always grew up feeling like women were second best to men. I don't see it and it doesn't affect me. Idealy, I would hope not to even have to get a job when I graduate college. I would love for my husband to make enough money that I can be a stay at home mom!
