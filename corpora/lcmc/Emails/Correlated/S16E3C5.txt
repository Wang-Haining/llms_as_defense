The Catholic Church, as usual, is behind the times in terms of fully
applying itself in the dynamic, globalized world.  I don't really pay much
attention to it, and thought the media circus surrounding the priest
allegations was really just the hyenas on CBS and NBC and FOX having a
field day and banking tons of cash on advertising space.

It just illustrates that the antiquated doctrine of having celebate,
strictly male, priests isn't going to work for very long.  These people
are turning into gay pedophiles, or if they aren't turning into gay
pedophiles, they are making it all the way through the seminary, and onto
pulpits with tendencies of gay pedophelia.

Through the ages, I don't think the Catholic church has really been a
constructive force at many different periods in time.  Look at the reasons
why martin luther was so disgusted with it, the cronyism and peddling of
relics merely reduced the entire church into a sort of religious "pyramid
scheme" which really only benefitted the clergy.  Clergy take vows of
poverty, but constitute some of the most greedy people I have ever met in
my life.  Sure church teachings on social justice are noble, but they are
so often held way too fervently that they true messages of love are
skewed, and take on attributes of hatred and condemnation,
