The war in Iraq must be stopped immediately. Since the war on terror began way back in 2003 only more terror has been sustained in Iraq.  The streets of bagdad are more dangerous than ever, and bombings and killings have only increased as our military occupation has been prolonged.  With our "new plan" in place to send even more troops over and to refuel our military reserves here in the states, one can only imagin just how many good american will be lost in this trivial act of self affirmation that our president has embarked upon in the middle east.  But what happens when this is over, ok so iraq might not be a threat any longer but terror sure as hell will be.  Iran, North Korea, Lebenon, Lybia, to name a few are all terror driven countries that have more military power than Iraq and still have militaristic dictators in charge.    The war in Iraq has gone on long enough, it has become a quagmire only comparable now to Vietnam and our presidents record low appoval ratings fairly accurately depict the state of the union.
