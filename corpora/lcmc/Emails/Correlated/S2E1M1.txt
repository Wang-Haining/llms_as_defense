    I feel that the legalization of marijuana is a good idea for many reasons. First, as opposed to alcohol, marijuana has no negative side effects. Second, there are no proven health risks to marijuana. Alcohol, on the other hand, has tons of negative side effects, both long-term and immediate. Third, if marijuana were legal, there would be much less crime. In Amsterdam, where marijuana is legal to a certain extent, crime is almost nonexistent. Fourth, if marijuana were legal, its price would certainly drop, and Americans would not have to waste so much money buying it. Whether you drink or you smoke marijuana, both will make you intoxicated in some way. However, alcohol brings with it many negative side effects and health risks. As long as alcohol is legal, marijuana should be legal as well.
