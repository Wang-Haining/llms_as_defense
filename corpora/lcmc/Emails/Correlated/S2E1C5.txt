    The Catholic Church could certainly use some changes in the modern times we live in.  Allowing female priests and allowing priests to marry would certainly prevent any pedophilia from occurring amongst priests.  However, I think people in general give the Catholic Church a lot less credit than they really deserve. There are many good men out there who have chosen to be priests.  The media, in broadcasting so much about the pedophilia incidents and making it seem more widespread than it really was, hurt all of these innocent men. While the pedophilia was not as widespread as everyone thought, I am sure that some changes to the church will keep these incidents to a bare minimum.
