To whom it may concern:

I feel as though the school officials were not invading privacy at all. The entire point of a myspace bulletin is for people- the public- to see. Why anyone would post something as horrible as a potential school shooting on myspace is beyond me, and even more so if the person does not expect to be caught. The school was doing its job by looking out for all of its students. If anyone within the school system is in danger, someone needs to do something to fix it. The school needs to make sure that its environment is a 100% save place for kids to be. Did the school harm the person who was going to do the shooting? No. The school used myspace- since it IS available to the public- to TURN OVER the potential shooter. I don't see anything wrong with the school turning over a student who was willing to kill others. Where should we draw the line for privacy though? I'd say that the school should not go on the internet to  only get kids in trouble. If there are lives in danger, then the school/police should be able to use things such as myspace to get kids in trouble. However, if the school is only looking for pictures of kids drinking, etc., then I think that that is an invasion of privacy. What the school did was good, but if they did the same thing for other reasons (to catch kids drinking, etc.), then THAT would be "taking it over the edge" as an invasion of privacy.
