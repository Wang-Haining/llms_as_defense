Although it has definitly improved, gender discrimination still exists
today. In the workplace, I feel that men harass women and do not even know
it. I learned in my social psychology class that even if an inapropriate
joke about women is made among male co-workers and a woman over hears and
is offended, that is sexual harassment. They can be brought up on charges
and potentially loose their jobs. I think that female discrimination is
the one that we see in the public eye the most but that does not mean that
men are never discriminated against. Little children are taught with falsh
cards. They see the male doctor and the female nurse. What is a man did
not want to be a full time doctor? What if he wanted to a nurse? We have
been conditioned since an early age that this would be breaking some kind
of social norm. Even a stay at home dad sounds creepy in today's society
although it is getting better and only time will help that. These breaking
of social norms are becomming more and more normal and only time will tell
if gender discrimination will be a thing of the past.
