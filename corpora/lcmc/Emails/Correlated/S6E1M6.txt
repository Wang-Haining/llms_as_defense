Dear CMC Study,

I think the primary reason that marijuana is illegal is because the government can't tax it. It's long-term effects are no worse than those of cigarettes (and some would argue markedly better), and the immediate effects it produces are similar to those of alcohol. I think that the other major reason it's illegal is because it has a social stigma attached to it, which is a little ridiculous when you examine the other behaviors society is willing to look the other way on. Denver has made a brave and ultimately very good decision. Even from a logistical standpoint, courts are frequently overwhelmed by cases of petty drug charges (and so are prisons, oftentimes), and a law like that helps to lighten that load in the long term. I think that if the government were to begin (trying) to strictly regulate the drug traffic and to legalize small amounts, as Denver has done, it would be a much preferable situation to the one they're dealing with now.

Peace,
