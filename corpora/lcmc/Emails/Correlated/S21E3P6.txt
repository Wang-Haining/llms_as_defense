This was not an invasion of privacy. Myspace is a public website that
anyone in the world has accesss to. I cannot believe that people would
even argue about a privacy right with this issue. It saved a school! I
trust that the officials of schools and in the government have reasons for
invading the privacy of citizens. I believe that if they do invade your
privacy that it is for a reason. They do not have time to just tap phone
calls to see what Jenny is doing tonight nor do they care. They should
draw the line by only going on concrete evidence. The school officials in
this case were well within their rights. They recieved a threat to their
students and they did something about it. This is what we would hope they
would do. And I think that if they didn't do anything about it because of
this kid's provacy rights people would be slightly upset! I think that as
long as they have a good reason and concrete evidence for invading
someone's privacy, then they are only doing their job, to protect.
