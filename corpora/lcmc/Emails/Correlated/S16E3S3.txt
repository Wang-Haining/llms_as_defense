We have come a long way toward gender equality in this country, and even
though the equal rights amendment failed, even though there is still a
gender-wage gap, we are much better than we used to be.

Women are allowed to vote and can hold almost any job men can.  Women
attend college frequently, right along with men, and then compete for the
same jobs.

We still have some pervasive gender roles involving male "heads of the
household" and female home-makers, but considering how infatuated we were
with the "nuclear family" idea in the 1950s, we have come a long way. 
Thank you Betty Friedan!

So basically, I don't think gender equality is a terribly pressing
issue... I know plenty of happy families who choose to forego traditional
gender roles, and plenty of happy families who adhere to them also.
