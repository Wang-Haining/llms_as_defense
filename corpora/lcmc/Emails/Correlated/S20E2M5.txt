I think that marijuana should be legalized not only in Denver but in all of the United States. Most  people who would want marijuana to be legalized are "pot heads," but I can honestly say that I have never smoked pot. Almost anyone who has smoked pot before would not be against its legalization. To state the opposite, most people who never want it legalized most likely have never even tried it before. I believe that the people who don't want marijuana legalized are afraid of the drug and its affects on its users. I actually think that the affects aren't bad at all. If you look at what it does to you, then I would be surprised if you would still dislike the drug with a passion. Here are somethings to consider: -It calms down the user
-it slows down one's movement
-a lot of times it makes you happy
-It has apparently never killed anyone
If this drug is legalized along the same lines and circumstances as alcohol, then mostly good things would come out of it. Instead of violent/drunk parents, the "abusive" parents would be calm and stoned (they would ignore children, but it would still be better than physical abuse). Given, I do not know a lot about the drug, and this is only based off of what my friends have told me. In relation to alcohol, the drug can definitely be treated as something very similar. Laws should limit it to adults over 21 years of age, you can't have it in a car at all in an opened bag, etc. The black market would decrease if it were legalized, and "bad batches" would not be smoked. As a closing statement, the government might as well make money off of it since a huge amount of America's youth already does the drug. Taxes on this could be used for schools, etc. which would benefit our country in general. Basically, the good affects of marijuana and its legalization would totally outweight its bad affects on its users/the country.
