I do not know which side to agree with. I am a straight Catholic girl. My grandmother condemns homosexuality,I guess being Catholic I should to, but I feel that people should be able to express themselves however they want to.If I were attracted to women, then yes I would be very upset with President Bush, but I'm not. I don't think it is right of Mr. Bush to push for an amendment to ban gay marriage. I am not totally comfortable with it, because it is so different to me, but I feel that in situations like these, you just have to put yourself in the other persons shoes. What if straight marriages were banned? What if the norm was gay marriage? And I was the odd one out? I would be very upset. I am not going to get up and rally about it, but I do sympathize for the people who are denied marriage. Isn't the federal government involved in most things anyways? So, sure, they can be involved here too.
