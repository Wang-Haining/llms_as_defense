I don't think the Church is outdated to the point where people feel isolated from it, therefore I don't think it needs to be changed immediately.  However, if the members of the Church agree that some of the practices are becoming archaic and uneffective in modern day, then change would be appropriate.
The pedophilia scandal is a shame, but it's the priests fault.  The Church is made up of humans who aren't perfect, and sometimes downright evil in the case of the pedophiles. However, priests have managed to do OK for centuries without raping little boys, so these people have no excuse.
