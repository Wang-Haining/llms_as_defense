The Catholic Church is one of theoldest institutions known to man. It is
crucial for any instution to be adaptable to the changing times but also
to keep their tradition alive to some extent. They have already modified
the fasting laws and the age that people are allowed to fast. I think that
there is no reason why women should not be able to further themselves by
becoming priests. They even had women priests in Jesus' day. Women are
equal to men in this society and if the Church refuses to recognize that
then I think they are up against a very large community of angry women. I
also understand that priest take an oath to be faithful and married to
God, however, I do not understand why God would not want them to
experience the joys of married and family life and for them to share God
with their families. I think it would only benefit the Catholic communtiy
seeing the priest with his family and how they act. It would be a good
model for the community. It would also keep mentally ill men from joining
the priesthood to cover up their pediphilia. This is a sick thing that has
happened in the Church and I believe that it could be avoided by giving
priests the option to marry.
