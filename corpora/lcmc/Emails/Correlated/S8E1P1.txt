No, this was not an invasion of privacy.  The internet is a public domain and anything that is put on the internet is accessable to many people.  The fact that the message was in the form of a bulletin is also another give away that it was meant to be seen.  By posting information like that in a bulletin rather than a message of some sort, they were destined to get some kind of negative reaction.
I feel that it is an invasion of privacy when they take a small hint that someone might be plotting something, maybe by saying "I hate my school" or something, and digging deeper into it.  They progress to ordering searches of that student all because of one very ambiguous statement.  While preventing school shootings is a necessity, they need to be able to have some key factors that draw the line between an angsty stressed student and an actual murder hungry savage.
