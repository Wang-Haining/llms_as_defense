In my opinion, if you are posting something on myspace, it's not private.  Myspace is a site that allows any other person who has an account to access your page, so if a creepy old men are able to acess a myspace page and stalk young girls, then school official should be allowed view the same information. If the student who posted the plan on the site really wanted it to be a secret, he wouldn't have exposed the plan in a place where anyone could have access to it. Also, in doing this, the school was able to prevent a very serious event that could have been fatal for many of its students. If I was attending that school, I would much rather my life be saved by an invastion of privacy, than having the school mind its own business and I not  make it home from school that day. I think that doing such things as searching students backpacks and lockers is an invasion of privacy, but if you are spilling your business on a public online site, you are just asking to get caught.
