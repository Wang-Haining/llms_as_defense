Yes, I feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States.  While advancements have been made towards closing this gap, there still exists many places where we have not been doing too well.  While people are taught in elementary school that both boys and girls are equal and we should always be respectful, many children learn from observation. 
Their father goes to the office everyday while their mother may either stay at home or hold some sort of part time job.  This teaches them, by observation, that men are the workers and women are the ones who take care of the family.
In order to make some kind of change, we have to continue on the same path that we have been.  That is, more and more women need to pull themselves out into the workplace and prove that they can do it too and defy aged boundries.  Also, both men and women need to learn to accept the change as a good thing rather than as a battle.  This only increases tension and increases the discrimination.
