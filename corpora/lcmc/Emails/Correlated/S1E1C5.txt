In many ways I do feel that the Catholic Church needs to change its ways. Their current ways of dealing with issues are not acceptable for the 21st century. As for the pedophilia I don't believe that it could have been prevented from changing the church. I do feel however that the church should allow preists to marry. Just becuase they are married it does not mean they aren't dedicated to god.
