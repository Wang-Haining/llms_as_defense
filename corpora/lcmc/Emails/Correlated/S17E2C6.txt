The Catholic Church is very outdated in its extremely conservative views,
and it needs to realize that if it wants to maintain a following, it needs to implement some changes in its doctrine.  We live in a world where anything goes, where we are taught tolerance and acceptance of others who may be different from ourselves in various respects.  The Catholic Church teaches to "love thy neighbor as thyself" but shuns homosexuals and non-Catholics, taking a very hypocritical stance.  Anyone who agrees with these views would be deemed intolerant by today's society, and since we are brought up learning the value of tolerance, this could be quite insulting.  Modern Catholics are put in a very difficult situation of choosing between their religious doctrine and the standards of society.  In order to fit in better with today's society, the Catholic church needs to relax some of its stringent rules to become more accepting and more appealing to a modern audience.  The accusation of pedophilia were probably unavoidable, but changes in the Catholic Church would still be a very beneficial thing.
