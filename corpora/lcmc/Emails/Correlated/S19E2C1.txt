I do feel as though the Catholic church is a bit outdated and should adapt to the 21st century. I feel that in doing this, it would have prevented many of the events that have tarnished the reputation of the Catholic Church. In allowing priests to marry, the church most likely could have prevented the occurrances of pedophilia because they would have had a way to express themselves sexually and in an appropriate manner. The Catholic church is still operating in pretty much the same manner and under the same system it has since its creation, and considering how far society as a whole has come, the Catholic church should greatly considering modernizing with the times. You don't really see these same types of problems in other denominations of Christianity, so I think this goes to show that modernizing would benefit the Catholic Church more than harm it.
