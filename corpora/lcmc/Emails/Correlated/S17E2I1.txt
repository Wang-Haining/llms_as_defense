The war in Iraq has gone on long enough.  No one knows exactly what the US is meant to be doing by occupying Iraq.  The goals of our presence there are unclear to the American public, making it hard as a citizen to support the continuance of the war.  It is easy to see only the negative aspects of war, such as lost lives, the fragmentation of families, the distraction from domestic affairs, and the way in which the war has become the focus of American foreign policy.  With no clear goal in mind, it is difficult to distinguish anything positive that could result from American occupation of Iraq.  The negative effects of the war are already taking a toll on American society, and the longer we continue to stay in Iraq, the worse these effects will become.  More families will be torn apart, more soldiers will die, and more pressing issues will arise and be neglected due to the focus on the war in Iraq.  There is really no purpose to the continued occupation of Iraq.  Americans should realize that their country in doing no good to the Iraqi people by having troops there.  The citizens of Iraq as well as the American population, would fare better if the American government left the war in Iraq and returned to its fulfilling its many other roles.
