Well, the war certainly is a big issue. As of now, I have no family over in Iraq, nor any close to me. I feel safer knowing that our troops are over in Iraq, honestly, I do not know if they are making a difference, but my biggest fear would be, battles here on the U.S. When I speak to people who have visited Iraq, it freightens me..the thought that this could happen here. I would rather the fighting be over seas then on our land. I guess it is selfsih, but it is the truth. I have two brothers, both eligible if there were to be a draft. Now, if that ever happened I would strongly oppose our troops in Iraq. I would never be able to live with the thought of my brothers fighting over there. I would be happier knowing that they are ok, here with me. As for the length of the war, just keep it away from our lands. I feel bad for those who have died, but they did a good thing, they kept people like me who would never dream of being there safe.
