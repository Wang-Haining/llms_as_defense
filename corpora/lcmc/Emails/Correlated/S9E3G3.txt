I am in favor of the legalization of gay marriage, and I support states like Massachusetts that have passed laws to allow it.  Vermont and New Jersey, allow civil unions between two gay people, but refrain from giving it the title of "marriage."  These states are taking the important steps in the fight against discrimination and the fight for equality among all different groups of people.

This is not the first time that the government has restricted the rights of its citizens to marry.  Before the Civil War, American citizens could not marry slaves.  But even after the Civil War, there were several state laws that banned marriage between white people and African Americans.  Some of these contiued into the late 20th century.  When my aunt married a black man in the early 1980's, it took a long time before all the members of my family actually accepted the marriage and welcomed her husband into the family.  I can't help but see in the opposition to gay marriage yet another form of discrimination manifesting itself in the American public.

There should not be an amendment to the Constitution that bans gay marriage.   I think that the President has much more important things to worry about, like National Security and the war that he started in Iraq.  I think questions of marriage should be left up to the states.
