There is no such thing as an unlawful invasion of privacy becuase Americans are nowhere guaranteed the right to privacy.  If the American government suspects potential harm, it has the power to invade the privacy of American citizens in the interest of doing what is best for the nation and the American people as a whole.  National security can only be acheived through invading privacy because subversive acts are naturally kept private.  No one would advertise their involvement in a harmful or malicious act, because of the consequences that could result. In order to uncover these acts before they happen, therefore, it is necessary to invade privacy and investigate suspicious activity.  If the government has reason to believe that someone is hiding something which could be dangerous to the US or to other people, the government has a duty to protect its citizens by investigating the hidden activity.  Of course, no government is justified in invading privacy without cause, but wherever suspicious activity is present or believed to exist, it is absolutely acceptable for the government to intervene, invading privacy if necessary to uphold safety and security. In the case of preventing a school shooting through an invasion of privacy, lives were saved and the invasion of privacy was completely justified because its aim was to maintain American security.
