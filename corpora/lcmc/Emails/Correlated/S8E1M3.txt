My thoughts on marijuana are that it should be legal for people over 21. Marijuana's effects aren't very similar to alcohol though.  The effects of marijuana are in fact much less inhibiting.  Alcohol causes you to slur your speech, fall over, overestimate your own abilities (such as being able to drive a car), and more or less deals a lot more damage healthwise (like it does to your liver and brain).
Marijuana on the other hand slows down the thought process, gives you a lightheaded-highlike feeling, increases philosophical thought and significantly increases appetite.  While smoking anything can cause potential health risks, marijuana does much less damage to the brain than alcohol does.  In fact, some studies are beginning to point out some of the medical uses of marijuana, and one has even been set out to try to show that marijuana actually increases brain cell growth. If it were a match of which should be legal between alcohol and marijuana, my vote would go towards marijuana.  However, I feel that both should be legal anyway, especially since the effects of marijuana are much less detremental both in the short term and long term.  I've heard many incidents of drunk driving fatalities, but I haven't heard a single one of marijuana + driving fatalities.
