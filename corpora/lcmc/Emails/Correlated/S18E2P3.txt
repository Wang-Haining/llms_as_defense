I am happy to hear of this news.  First of all, I personally think MySpace should be taken down from the internet, because there are so many kids under 13 blatently lying about their age to gain access to a profile.  After they do this, they then state their real age in the summary of themselves! With so many underage profiles, a red flag should go up about
the morality of such a site. About the school shooting, good for the school administrators!  Invasion of privacy my ass, if these kids are stupid enough to document every single detail of their life in public domain (ie anyone can join and read it) then they should get caught.  Schools shouldn't draw any line short of illegally gaining access to online info of their students.  The prevention of the school shooting is proof that this kind of monitoring works.
