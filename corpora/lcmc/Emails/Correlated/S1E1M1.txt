Ido not agree with the city of Denver's decision to legalize marijuana. I believe that if marijuana was legalized it would be harmful to us instead of helpful. The only positive side effect of marijuana is when it is used to treat medical patients. I think that it should be legal for this reason only. Other then that effect marijuana is harmful to your body and your mind. I do have friends that would be 100% for the legalization, however I don't think that this drug has had a positive effect on them. The argument could be made that the effects are similar to those of alcohol, but i have seen them as having different effects.
