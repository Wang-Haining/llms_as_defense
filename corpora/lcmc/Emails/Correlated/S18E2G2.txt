I don't care whether gay people get married - whatever lifestyle they choose is their decision, so as long as it doesn't harm anybody else, let them do what they want.  However, it might be easier to have the government view marriages as civil unions (just changing the name, not the benefits), as not  to discriminate between one marriage or the other. A constitutional amendmant banning gay marriage is just stupid. I can't fathom why one of the defining documents of the US would be tampered with to deal with such a relatively minor issue. Finally, if all the states agree with the same decision, I don't see how a federal law to some things up would be that bad.
