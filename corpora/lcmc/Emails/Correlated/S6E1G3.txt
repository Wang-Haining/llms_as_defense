Dear CMCC Study-

The federal debate over gay marriage is asinine. Constitutionally speaking, I believe it's a matter which should be left to the States.

My feelings about President Bush cannot be described in polite terms, so I won't go there.

The erroneous line of reasoning that concludes that the banning of gay marriage will protect "family values" is also absurd in itself. First of all, in order to follow this logic, one has to first posit that there is a coherent standard for what can be considered "family values." This ignores the plethora of cultural norms and values present in American society, and therefore begins on false premises. Second, the conservative push for "family values" is ridiculous in itself. Mark Foley, anyone? Government funding for South American countries to slaughter their own peoples during the Reagan Administration? Economic policies which consistently widen the gap between the top and bottom of the wage-earning spectrum? These don't really jive with any notion of "family values."

Our country is predominantly homophobic. The ability for gays to get married in civil ceremonies wouldn't have have any practical negative consequences for our country. The right would involve just that: civil ceremonies. People can go on holding whatever uptight ideas they please within their own religions, which have nothing to do with government sanctioned unions.

Peace,
