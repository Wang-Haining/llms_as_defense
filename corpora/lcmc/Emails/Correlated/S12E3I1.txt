I believe that war in Iraq has gone on for far too long.  A just cause for going to war would have been to aid another country in need of governmental assisstance.  If our true purpose, as the United States, was to help Iraq restore a Democratic government then the cause, in my eyes, was completely justified.  For whatever reason there are countries in the world that have fallen in to regimes that inflict a great deal of unjust power on their citizens and the regime, over time, has been enforeced and engrained in to the society so that it is very hard to break or even see that it is wrong anymore.  The United States was completey right in starting the war and helping to break down the tyranny so the citizens could experience a more liberating government.

If, however, the government chose to go to war in Iraq for more personal reasons dealing with President Bush's family history with Sadam Hussein, then it was completely unjustified.  There is no reason that an entire country should go to war and spend numerous resources for a cause that stems back to personal bad blood between two men.  There are far better uses to our country's resources than a war for unjust personal reasons.

Since we have already gotten our point across that we wanted to spread democracy, I believe our retreat has been long since overdue.  The point has been made and we are now wasting precious resources on foreign soil.  We are having problems with our social security system, poverty, and many other things on our own soil, yet we are spending billions of dollars to fight a war that has lost any sort of meaning or purpose.  At some point the officials in Iraq need to take the reigns back and take the government over for themselves, and the sooner the better so they do not become dependent.
