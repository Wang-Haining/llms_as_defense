I absolutely feel as though the catholic church needs to change its ways, not only to adapt to life in the 21st century but also to help cleanse its image that has been tarnished over the past decade or so from pedophilia accusations.  Women are as much a part of working America as men are and in many other religions women are perfectly capable of running a congregation as its spiritual leader.  If we are supposed to believe that all men and women have been created in the image of God then should all men... and women be able to teach the word of God.  The church needs to change it's ways now.  With a rather new Pope in office and ever changing landscape of the world we live in Priests should be allowed to marry and women should be allowed to preech.
