I think that alcohol has a more potent effect than marijuana. Marijuana seems to relax individuals. It seems normal for guys to drive when they are high, but then they would never drive when they are drunk. Weed seems easier to obtain then alcohol, which is strange because the easier one to get is illegal. I think any form of smoking is unnecessary..people are just killing their lungs, so if cigarettes are legal, then they might as well make weed legal. But then, on the other hand, when I think of weed and the people that smoke it, I consider them "dirtbags". So I do not think that would create a good image. If we legalized it people would take advantage of it. We seem to overly consume everything..so I take back my previous statement, because if weed was legal, there would be no moderation, just like there is no limit for alcohol.
