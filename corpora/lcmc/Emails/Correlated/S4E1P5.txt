    First off, the internet is a public place.  If you can access information, then by all means, go ahead.  It is your right as an American citizen to look up information that you are authorized to see.
    Furthermore, what are the negative consequences of schools or government organizations monitoring public web sites?  If you aren't doing anything illegal, then what is the problem?  If you are doing illegal things, like planning a school shooting, then it looks as if "invasion of privacy" is a good thing after all.
    The Patriot Act falls somewhat into this category.  This act is designed to protect us.  No one cares about information that might be embarrassing to a certain person.  The NSA monitors phone conversations that contain key words linked to the possibility of terrorist action.  The analysts who monitor these calls don't care about individual people.  They are simply doing their jobs protecting lives.
    People need to grow up and stop worrying about their privacy being breached because certain examples like the one above have shown that it only makes us safer when other people seek out and monitor certain media.
