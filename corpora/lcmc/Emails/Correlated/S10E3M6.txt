Pot should be legal.  In small amounts it would only be used for personal use and without the distribution of it what is wrong with getting a little high once in a while.  The affects of getting drunk lead to violence, rape, impaired vision, and numerous other life threatening situations.  Getting high leads to increaded eating, laziness, and dare i say to much video game playing, i have never heard of the guy who smoked to much then went home and beat his wife, stole the car and then consequentely crashed it into the tree a block from his house.  It is one of the sadest realities of our country.  We will legalize alcohol and cigarettes which both have proven mental and physical health effects far worse than that of pot, but we wont legalize the weed.  IT is a flurishing underground market that needs to become mainstream.  If regulated and controlled properly, the marijuana industry could revolutionize the american trade market with numerous other countries.
