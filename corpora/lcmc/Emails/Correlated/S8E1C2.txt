No, I don't feel the Catholic Church needs to change if they don't want to.  I believe that the Catholic Church is its own institution and it can run how it wants.  Though, it would be nice to see some of these incidents of molestation drift away.  It is really up to the church for change though.
As of now, I think that the Catholic branch of Christianity is way to strict to allowcate any possible change.  It almost feels like the Catholic Church will end up like the Amish.  Strict ties to religion while ignoring society around it.  Though I don't feel that they absolutely NEED to change, as I'm fully content with people practicing what they believe in as much as they would like, I wouldn't mind seeing some kind of change.
