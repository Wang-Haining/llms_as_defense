Considering that the effects of alcohol are potentially much more fatal than those of marijuana, it is not really doing any harm for the government to legalize it. People die from alcohol poisening all the time, but you've never heard of someone overdosing from smoking too much pot. In legalizing marijuana, the government will actually be able to have more control over it and prevent such things as users unknowingly buying the drug laced with other, more dangerous substances. It may also help to reduce drug related violence because there would be no conflicts over being on someone elses turf. Also, law enforcement could focus on more serious crimes, rather than arresting people for possessing a drug that is less lethal than alcohol. Not only is marijuana less lethal the alcohol, it is less lethal than many perscription drugs. At this point, it is doing more harm to make marijuana illegal than it is to legalize it and people will smoke it regardless, so the goverment might as well get control over it.
