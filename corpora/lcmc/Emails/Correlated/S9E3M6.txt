I am quite shocked about this actually.  I had no idea that something like this was even being considered.  I know that the issue of medicinal marijuana has often been discussed, and for that I see some sort of beneficial purpose and good intention.  When hospital patients are in extreme pain, as when they suffer from some sort of chronic illness, sometimes marijuana may be the only thing that relieves that pain.  However, I'm not sure if I can discern any good reason why recreational marijuana should be legal.

Marijuana is very much like alcohol in the negative and often dangerous effects it has on people.  But marijuana does not have any redeeming positive effects.  You see, if alcohol is consumed in moderation, studies have shown that it can be beneficial for one's health (lowering blood pressure and things like that).  Marijuana actually poses a more dangerous health threat than alcohol, because smoking marijuana, like smoking anything, damages your lungs.

This topic raises many questions for me.  How much marijuana is legal?  How much can you have and still be able to drive?  I keep thinking of a commercial that I used to see all the time, about a teenage driver who hit his brother and killed him.  The point of the commercial was that the driver was NOT drunk; he was HIGH.  I also wonder about the production of marijuana.  Will the growth of marijuana still be regulated? How will people over 21 get the marijuana?

I don't think that this is a good idea. And I don't see any other cities folllowing Denver's lead.
