    While I initially supported the war in Iraq, I think it may be time to leave. Regardless of why we entered Iraq in the first place, it seems that the progress we are making over there has dropped to a dead standstill. My own brother, who joined the Marines several years ago, has already been over to Iraq twice. It is not worth risking my brother's life and the lives of all the other military we have over there for the little progress we are making in the country. Also, the country's morale and our view amongst the other superpowers of the world are both steadily dropping each and every day. This country, at its time of need, needs to end the war and rebuild while we still can.
