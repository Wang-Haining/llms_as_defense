    I feel that much of the negative attitude toward marijuana, and other drugs for that matter, stems from the illegal drug trade around the world.  Having a drug legally available for consumption turns it into a whole different story.  I have a summer job working in a hospital pharmacy.  One thing I don't think people realize is that a drug is a drug.  Many of them, including the ones in the hospital, have harmful side-effects that are far greater than those of marijuana.  In fact, our pharmacy stocks THC, the hallucinatory ingredient in marijuana, in pill form.
    I'm not saying that marijuana should be made into an over the counter drug.  It would have to be prescribed by a doctor of course.  There are many other drugs that are available for use with prescription, such as Percoset, Vicodan, and other opiate derivatives.  These drugs are highly addictive, but marijuana is not.  Yet they are legal and marijuana is not
    If a drug has some benefit (and marijuana does) I think it should be utilized.  As far as it being available to the general public – like alcohol for example - this would not be a good idea.  You can't just go out and get prescription drugs at the store, and I feel that marijuana should be placed in the "prescription drug category."  I feel that the legalization of medicinal marijuana should not only be allowed, it should be encouraged.  However, marijuana should not be available to the general public because of the negative side effects on health, regardless of age.  It would be abused.  There's no way to get around that.
