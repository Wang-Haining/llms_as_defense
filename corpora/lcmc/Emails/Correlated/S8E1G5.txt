I think both sides are wrong.  While legalizing it is what I WOULD support, I also am very supportive of separation of church and state.  The government should have no say in a matter like this.  Though being married does create paperwork for things such as taxes, just because the partner is someone of the same sex does not mean that this will become a problem.  I think that it is up to the church to decide matters like this, that way people will always have an option if they want it and always be able to avoid it if they don't.  I am wholely against President Bush's THOUGHT about implementing an amendment of the sort.  Amendment's are supposed to tell us what the government can and cannot do, not tell us what WE can and cannot do.  That's for state law.  In all honesty I feel that President Bush has absolutely no clue about how the government is supposed to work and likes to cross lines that have been in place for scores and centuries.
