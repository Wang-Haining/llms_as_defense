    I do not feel like gender discrimination, collectively, is an issue in the present-day U.S.  There may be examples of discrimination here and there, but I think the vast majority of employers do not use gender discrimination.  In this day and age, it is simply not wise for employers to practice gender discrimination.  If it is apparent that they are doing this, they will find themselves facing a lawsuit that they are likely to lose.  It just makes good business sense to be an equal opportunity employer.
    I do think that women use gender discrimination as a crutch in modern society.  Many women want to be equal in every way, shape, and form as men.  Biology will teach us, however, that men and women are physically different.  There is no disputing this fact.  As a result, men tend to be stronger than women.  Consequently, there are jobs in which men are preferred over women because the worker needs to be strong.  Man employers who need a strong individual will choose a man over a woman.  This is not because of gender discrimination.  The employer is just being smart.
    Gender discrimination is a thing of the past.  Employers today don't want to waste their time discriminating against women - they simply want good results.  Sometimes the way to achieve these results is to hie a man - who is stronger - over a woman.
