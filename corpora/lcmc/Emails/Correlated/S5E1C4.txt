Well, I do not think it is the church, but more the people within the church. Honestly, there are corrupt people everywhere. I think that the pedophilia issues created a bad image for the church...there are so many good priests, and these twisted men just ruined it. I think that the church has adapted its ways to conform to the 21st century. I don't think that we should have female priests though. I have grown up with the idea of male priests and it would just be weird if it were anything different. Like on the show 7th Heaven..I find it weird that the the daughter Lucy is a minister! I do not think that these acts could have been avoided. You cannot change the way people are born, people cannot be tested for a pedophile gene just like they cannot be tested for a gene that will make them a rapist. The question could be found in the pool of people that become priests. Maybe we are recruiting the wrong type of men?
