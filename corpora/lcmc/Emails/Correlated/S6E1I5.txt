Dear CMC Study,

Please give me a minute to compose myself...

Okay, the war in Iraq was a monstrously bad idea. I don't see any two ways about it. It's introduced even more instability into a region that wasn't exactly a sterling example of U.S.-friendly feelings to begin with. Furthermore, I think that many of the unacknowledged motivations for the war were economic, and hundreds of thousands of people have died because of those motivations (blood oil in your gasoline tank, anyone?).

I don't think the war should continue. I think the warring factions in Iraq realize that it really isn't to anyone's advantage to continuously fight each other, though this will probably continue to happen for sometime. By many accounts, much of the animosity in Iraq is directed at the occupying forces (us). I think that if we pulled out now, the country would remain unstable for a period, but would move into a relatively calm position within a reasonable amount of time.

And the Bush administration should really stop rolling dice when it comes to foreign policy.

Peace,
