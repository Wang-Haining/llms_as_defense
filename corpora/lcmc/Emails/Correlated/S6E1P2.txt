Dear CMCC Study,

I'll have to try to put aside my strong distaste for myspace for the moment (it's a disgusting excuse for internet voyeurism and cheapens more legitimate forms of human interaction and communication). People need to keep in mind that myspace is an open forum. This means that anything posted on it can be viewed by anyone else. Myspace does have a "privacy" option, but I'd argue that anyone who places information they wouldn't want other sot see on the internet is asking for trouble.

I think that since myspace is an open forum, school officials were within their rights to use the information they found posted. The student who was dumb enough to make the posting acted the same as if he had posted it on a regular billboard in a hallway somewhere.

There are, of course, limits to the lengths law enforcement and school officials can go, and I believe that those lines need to be more sharply delineated. The Supreme Court has dealt with the privacy rights of minors in the public education system many times before, but questions involving the internet are relatively new and need to be worked through. An important Supreme Court ruling in the 1960's (the name of which escapes me) involving students wearing arm bands in protest of the Vietnam War commented to the effect that "Students do not leave their rights at the schoolhouse gate." I think that a students use of any form of internet communication which could reasonably be considered private should be respected as such.

Peace,
