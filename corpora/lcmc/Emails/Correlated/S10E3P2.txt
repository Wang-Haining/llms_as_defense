I believe in protection of ones privacy.  I would not want the athletic director at loyola looking on facebook seeing a picture of me drinking and then being suspended for the act.  That would be invading my privacy and for no purpose.  However, that all being said any time another persons life is at risk or life in general is at risk i believe in any means necessary to stop it.  So if its facebook invasion or myspace invasion then yes, i agree with it.  You can never be to careful when dealing with crazy people.  But for petty drinking and smoking punishments that are found on these open forums for peoples information, i disagree strongly with that.  Porpper discression must be used by the powerful people checking our websites, that is where the line should be drawn.
