I feel fine about Denver legalizing marijuana.  All the evidence I have seen points to a simple fact - when used in moderation and in an appropriate setting, marijuana does not hurt anyone.  Actually, the people who use it seem to have a blast!  Alcohol, which is legal for people over 21, causes people to get "sloppy drunk" and angry, resulting in bar fights and other idiotic displays of immaturity. People who get stoned just watch
TV -  I don't even think they would have the energy to get in a fight. Most importantly, you can die of alcohol poisoning. Its physically impossible to overdose on marijuana - the amount you would need to consume is so large that the person would simply pass out before they could even get halfway.  Knowing all this, it seems pretty obvious that alcohol has worse effects than marijuana.  Since alcohol is legal, shouldn't marijuana be as well?
