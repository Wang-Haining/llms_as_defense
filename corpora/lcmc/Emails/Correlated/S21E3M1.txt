I feel that the legaliation of marijuana in Denver based on the amount is
not such a good idea. I believe that this drug is similar to alcohol in
that it gives you a high and impairs your judgement. I think that if they
were to even think about the legaliation, they should base it on an age
requirement like they do for alcohol. I have recently read that marijuana
has not yet been proven to be extremely harmful to the body if it is done
every so often, not on a day to day basis. However, it has been proven to
be a "gateway drug" to more intense, powerful, harmful drugs such as
heroine and cocaine. I think that they should legalize it because it would
allow the authorities to focus on more important things and I feel like
less people would be compelled to do it because it would no longer be a
thrill. From most people that I have talked to who smoke marijuana, they
only started because of the aderenaline rush that they got from doing it
because it was illegal. Maybe legalizing it would, in the long run, help.
I do not think it is fair for someone to judge what is a large amount and
what is a small amount, that amount will differ from person to person.
Age, however, is more of a concrete law.
