Gender discrimination will always exist, because people will always reference what has happened in the past. Even when someone satirizes gender discrimination (provide an extreme example to highlight the flaws in that way of thinking), they are still prolonging its life by reminding people how to discriminate. Today, women and men are viewed much more equally in the workplace then the 50s, but I don't believe we have eradicated gender discrimination completely. Anyone can be subject to discrimination - everyone is different in their own way, and that can always be viewed in a negative light.
