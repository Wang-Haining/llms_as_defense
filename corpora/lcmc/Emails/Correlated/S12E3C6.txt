The Catholic Church does need to change its ways to adapt to life in the 21st Century.  This must occur in areas such as social life and scientific endeavours.  Many of their requirements such as no meat on Fridays during Lent or necessary attendance of church once a week have long since lost their true meaning.  The main idea is that people practicing the faith will take in some of the core values of the Catholic Church through these actions; however, they have become what many would describe as monotonous and meaningless.  There should be refreshing and more directly applicable ways to experience the values the church wishes to give to the followers.

In the realm of science the church especially needs to come to the modern world.  When the church was founded over a millenium ago there was barely an existence of science as we know it today.  Over time, however, there have been great advancements for humans in the field of science revealing many new truths.  Many of these truths actually go against reasoning or "truth" the church held early on or had as a part of their religious scripts.  One such example is evolution and the creation of the universe.  There has been great scientific studies proving that evolution exists and that the creation of the universe came about from the Big Bang Theory as opposed to the obviously fictional stories in the Book of Genesis.  I believe there is a loss of credibility when the church refuses to apply reason to such scientific evidence.  It would certainly not take away from their core values and beliefs.

Changes as they pertain to priests should be very minimal.  I believe that the priests, in addition to being officials of the church, are examples for the people practicing the religion to follow.  They are extreme examples in many cases because of the certain vows they take, but nonetheless Catholics can take away less extreme values from the priests to apply to their lives in an effort to aim towards a better life.
