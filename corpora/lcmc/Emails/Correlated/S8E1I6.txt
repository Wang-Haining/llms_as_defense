I've been against the war from the moment we entered it.  When I first heard news of an invasion of Iraq, I asked myself, "What did they have to do with 9/11?  Shouldn't we have our focus on Osama Bin Laden?"  I had no clue how President Bush had even come to the conclusion that Iraq had "weapons of mass destruction," but now it is apparent that is sources were flawed.
While it's impossible to say that the invasion was all bad, considering we removed a brutal dictator from power, it still doesn't cancel out all of the negatives.  The thousands of lives lost, the families of soldiers on both sides, the innocent lives taken are all to remove a dictator and leave a country in a larger state of chaos than it has been in a long time.  We have gotten ourselves stuck in a situation, trying to impose our own system of government on a group of people whom a great amount of do not want.  It's like trying to fit the square block in the round hole.  It just won't work.
