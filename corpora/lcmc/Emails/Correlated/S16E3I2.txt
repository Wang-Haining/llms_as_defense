Faulty intelligence, a cowboy-like mentality, an ass-backwards media whose
priorities AREN'T to spread truthful information but to retain viewership
and sell advertising space, an entire country blaming a single man (our
president), and failure to clairvoyantly perceive the implications of the
power vacuum that would succeed Saddam Houssein's removal.. these are some
of the finer points of the conflict in Iraq.

I have friends over there, and have personally known two of the
three-thousand plus American soldiers who have died.  Basically, it's a
mess in Iraq.  We are caught up in between groups who have hated each
other for a VERY LONG time, since long before Saddam Houssein, or
operation "shock and awe", were on anyone's minds.  The sunnis, shiites,
and kurds simply do not want democracy.  They do not get along.  I doubt
our ability, furthermore, our authority to install a particular political
system where they can all get along.

There is something kind of pretentious about forcing democracy on another
country.

Then again, Saddam Houssein was an absolute nutjob, and he did horrible
things.  Like gas thousands of his own people.  But seriously, how much of
a threat did this man pose?  When he saw us coming into Iraq, he buried
his fighter jets under big piles of sand in the Desert.  He honestly
thought he was going to win the war, and he'd need them afterwards to
suppress a rebellion in the south.

The longer we are in Iraq, the more we will need some sort of shift in our
priorities for being there.  HEARTS AND MINDS!!
