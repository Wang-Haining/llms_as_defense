Marraige is a right that belongs to one person just as much as it belongs to the next.  Homosexuals and heterosexuals alike should be given the opportunity to marry whomever they choose.  Nowhere in the founding American  documents is it written that marraige is to be solely between a man and a woman.  The US government has no grounds for banning gay marraige.  Gay marraige should be accepted everywhere without question. A constitutional amendment banning gay marraige would be intolerant of heterosexual Americans and would be unfair treatment.  Such an amemdment would be outrageous and would likely be widely opposed.  The marraige of two individuals who are in love and choose to spend time with one another should not be the affair of any government.  Love is between two people and two people only, whether that be a man and woman or two people of the same gender.  In all cases, eveyone has the right to solidify their love for and committment to another individual through the binding act of marraige.
