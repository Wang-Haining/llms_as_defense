I think gender discrimination absolutely still exists in our country, but not at the same level of intensity that it once was. There are many men today who still feel that women belong "in the kitchen." Many times it is said in a joking way, but there is still some sense of truth to it in their minds. In the workplace, men often feel that women are not good enough, and are not able to accomplish the same things that they are. Women are looked at as sexual beings and not much more. However, many men have seen discrimination too. The idea of "Mr.Mom", a stay at home dad with a woman as the main source of income is not at all uncommon, but still men who choose this as their profession are ridiculed.
