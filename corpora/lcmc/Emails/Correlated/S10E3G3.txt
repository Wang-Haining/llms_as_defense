This is a topic in which i have very strong opinions about.  I am completely 100% in favor of gay marriage, so much infact that i think it should be a federal law and that law should be marriage is betteen two people not a man and a women.  In high school i was a member of SAGABA my high schools streight gay and bisexual allience.  I met numbers of openly gay students at my school that on a daily basis faced hatred that i knew nothing about.  Many of them lived their daily lives affraid of who they are becaue they were going to a non excepting school that in many cases had predjudice teachers taking out their hatred on them as well.  These kids graduated from my high school and moved on to bigger, better, and more accepting things.  They had spend 7 years in the Strath Haven bubble facing name calling, physical abuse, and worst of all fear of who they really were.  Some of them have now gone on to find love and now why shouldnt they be able to express it with marriage the same way any other loving couple in our country does.  It should be federal law to allow gay marriage, and as soon as our racist, homophobic moron of a president is out of office (and that day can not come soon enough) i feel the next president ellected(a democrat god willing) will  allow for our entire countries population to find love and happiness.
