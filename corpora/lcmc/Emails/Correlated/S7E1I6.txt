Honestly like many Americans on september 11th I was for the war in Iraq.
I wanted the U.S. to go there with our big guns and show them who they
messed with. But now I'm not as sure and to be honest I'm not actually
sure about the details of the war. The main thing is that now I believe
that the war in Iraq is wrong. I believe that Bush is trying the colonize
Iraq and make it a middle  east U.S. I believe that Bush figures its a
win-win situation, the Iraqis will have protection from anyone that tries
to harm them and the U.S. will have control over their oil, which we so
desperately need. If Bush hasn't come up with a set plan on what he is
going to do with Iraq he needs to give them back control of their country.
Which I believe is even more detrimental to the U.S. because we will
probably be leaving there country in shambles. No government, no schools,
no resources to live off and begin a new a life. What are they going to do
if we leave? But if we stay I feel like we will be over there for years to
come because Bush would most likely want to give them a democratic
government which is probably unheard of over there. In a democratic
government that would give women equal rights, what would they do if that
happended?!?! All-in-all im kind of stuck in the middle on my position on
the war, I believe the U.S. should pull out but I don't want another 9/11
because of it.
