I definitely feel as though the war in Iraq has gone on long enough. What began as a war on terrorism has turned into pointless killing of our troops. No progress at all has been made in Iraq, and once Sadaam was out of the country, there was really no other justifiable reason to remain. It is obvious by the way the Iraqis are treating our troops that they no longer want us in their country and I think it is time Bush admit defeat and bring them home. He has lost so much respect and support by keeping our troops there and the best thing to do is to let them return to their families and for us to go about our own business instead of medling in the business of others. We have our own problems to fix here at home so there is no sense in trying to fix the problems of another country, especially one that does not want our help. We have wasted billions and billions of our tax dollars on a pointless war and it is about time we accept defeat and bring everyone home. We are doing no good there and people are dying for a lost cause. We are making about as much progress here as we did in Vietnam and the Gulf War. Just think of the lives we could have saved if Bush had made better decisions and knew when to cut his losses.
