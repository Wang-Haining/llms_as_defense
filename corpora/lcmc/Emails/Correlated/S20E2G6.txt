To whom it may concern-

I believe that gay "marriages" should not exist at all in the U.S. (or anywhere in general). With the occasional events where I am grossed out, I have no problem with gay men or women. I am a Roman Catholic, so it is technically against my religion to allow gay marriages. A marriage was created for a man and a woman to be united. Why doesn't the government create a different word for the union of two men or women? The "union" would not be valid within the Church, but there is no stopping the Church's opinion since the religion won't (and shouldn't) change. I feel that President Bush's "push for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage" is half good and half bad. The United States WAS created based on Christian principles whether people today like it or not. For this reason, President Bush is correct in following in our forefathers footsteps. Bush is wrong, however, for interfering with American's beliefs and lifestyles. In a way, it seems as though the government, based upon this legal action, is STARTING be become a totalitarian government, or whatever that is called. If the government could create an official "union" between two men or women, then I think that that plan would be sufficient to meet everyones needs. A marriage would remain sacred within the Church, and gay couples could legally be together. This plan would hopefully make everyone happy and get rid of all the controversy within our country on this topic today.

Thanks for your time....again.
