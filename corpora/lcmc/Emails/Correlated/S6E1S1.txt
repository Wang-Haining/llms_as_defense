Dear CMCC Study,

Yes, of course gender discrimination is still and issue in the United states. It's derived from a mindset our culture has inherited from millenia of paternalistically structured Western societies.

I believe that gender discrimination, at it's root, stems from ingrained cultural patterns, so any work to change it must begin at a very basic level. This means that it will take a long time to accomplish. I believe the work of feminist writers and theoreticians from throughout the 20th century have given us a good starting point, particularly those that deconstruct biased notions inherent in the linguistic norms of our language (the use of phrases like "mankind", or the preference for male pronouns when making general statements, for example). Basically, what I mean by this is that working against gender discrimination is a matter of changing attitudes, and that laws really only help on a superficial level.

Yes, women are still discriminated against in the workplace and in other places, as are men (though not as frequently). I think that the percentages of women in higher-level positions in the workforce and in politics is still very revealing. And not to sound like a conservative pundit, but there is such a thing as "reverse discrimination" as well. While it is rarer, occasionally qualified men do receive the short end of the stick when it comes to promotions and things of that nature because of "politically correct" considerations.

Peace,
