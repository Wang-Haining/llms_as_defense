I think that the war has definitly gone on on long enough. Becuase I was
greatly affected by 9/11 I can see why Bush sprung into action so quickly.
At that time when everyone was emotional, I would have done the same
thing. There was no other option. We could just not retaliate. However, we
have been over there for years now and have made little progress and have
spent way too much money into trying to better another country that, in my
opinion, will be in ruins for years to come. If they cannot even get along
with each other, then how are we suppose to go in there and expect to
change their minds and ways of life. There is no way. I think by staying
there we are just digging ourselves into a deeper hole. We are loosing
soldiers and money to what has no become a lost cause. I feel that the
only way that we can do anything is by bringing our troops home and
heightening security on the homefront. That is the best that we can do. We
cannot keep getting ourselves tangled in other countries' affairs.
Although we are not going to be there, we still have to keep an eye on
them because whether we like it or not, Iraq and the Middle East will
always be our problem.
