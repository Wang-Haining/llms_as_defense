First, the shooter was dumb to post a myspace bulletin. I don't understand why people have these stupid personal pages and leave their lifes history for any random person to read about! THe kid must have wanted to get caught if he/she was silly enough to post a bulletin leading authorities to assume that he was going to bring a gun to school. I do not think this was an invasion of privacy by any means. Everything on the internet is open to the public. People post personal things to be read-they cannot pick and choose who they want to read it or not. At my high school, our principle had an account..it was well known..the administration would occasionally check up on what was going on in the school. I had no problem with it..if you feel like you have to hide something, then maybe you should not be doing it! Where to draw the line? Well, if it is for our safety and well being, then I don't think there needs to be a line. If kids express themselves through the internet rather then getting help, then authorities should have the rights to see these things. Sometimes people express themself better through writing-a troubled person could just be waiting for someone to hear them and help.I have nothing to hide that I post. If you want to hide something..do I have nothing to hide that I post. If you want to hide something..do not post it online. This will help with the whole drawing the line issue. We can allow authorities to keep an eye on troubled people not post it online. This will help with the whole drawing the line issue. We can allow authorities to keep an eye on troubled people
