I am one hundered percent for gay marraige. I think when two people want to get married, no matter who the two people are they should be allowed to do so. I think it is wrong to say that they cant. Who is President Bush to say that there are some people in the United States that are not allowed to be together? The federal government should not have any more of a say in this type of marriage that they do in any other.
