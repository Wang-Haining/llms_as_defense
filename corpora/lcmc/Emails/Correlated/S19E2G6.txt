I think that the issue of gay marriage should be one of state governments and not national government. Because many states are democratic and are supportive of gay marriage, i think it should be up to the governments of those states to decide rather than our republican president forcing his beliefs on the entire country. Although I'm not a complete supporter of homosexuality, I do have a lot of gay friends and I feel as though I would want them to be happy and able to have the same opportunities as heterosexual couples. I don't think that people should be judged or treated unfairly soley based on their sex preference and by banning gay marriage, that it what the government is doing.
