I do feel as though gender discrimmination is still present in today's society. Although women have come a long ways in regards to equality and having the same opportunities as men, there is still that underlying sense of inferiority. I feel that gender discrimmination is more a problem in society's way of thinking because it shouldn't be a law that women be treated equally, it should just be that they are equal. Unless people change they this way of thinking all together, gender discrimmination will never go away. I find that when hanging out with my guy friends they will say jokes and comments in regards to women being inferior and although they just do it for a laugh, such jokes and comments show that there is still that underlying belief that has been present in society in regards to the status of women. Men should see women as equals because they want to not because they have to. I still feel as though if a man and a woman are going up for the same job position and are equally qualified, the man will get the job over the woman soley based on his gender. Also, women get less respect in the work place and we still see cases of sexual harrassment by co-workers. If men and women were really seen as equal, this problem would not still exist. Also, women who hold high positions in jobs are not always given the respect they deserve or the respect a man in the same position would get. During my senior year in high school and the summer before I left for college i worked as a nhas since its creation, and considering how far society as a whole has come,ight time receptionist and the daytime receptionist was a man. I found that one of the men I worked with was very condescending towards me and treated me in a way that he would never treat the daytime receptionist, and it probably had something to do with my gender.
