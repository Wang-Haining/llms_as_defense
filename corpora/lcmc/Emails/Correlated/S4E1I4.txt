   While I do feel that war should only be utilized if all other methods fail, I also feel that it is a necessary part of the world.  The war in Iraq was fought for a purpose - to remove Saddam Hussein from power.  It was quite apparent to everyone that Saddam was not a friend of the free world.  To me, it does not matter if we went to war over weapons of mass destruction that weren't there.  The U.S. saw a threat and dealt with it.  And now the world is a safer place because of it.
    I cannot stand when people use hindsight to justify their arguments.  People who oppose the war in Iraq say that the president was lying to the American people about the WMD's.  In the business of intelligence gathering, not all intelligence is accurate.  Based on the intelligence the U.S. had at the time, we decided the probability of Saddam possessing WMD's was too high  not to take action. 
    I realize that war is costly in terms of soldiers' lives and money.  But teh bottom line is that the war in Iraq was necessary, if not now, then ten years into the future.  I applaud George Bush for having the courage to make an unpopular, but courageous decision.
