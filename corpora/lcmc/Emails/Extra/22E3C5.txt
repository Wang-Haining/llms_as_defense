 The Catholic Church would do well to change some of its ways in order to adapt to life in the 21st Century. An institution that does not re-evaluate itself does not last as long as one that does. The issue of pedophilia here is something that cannot be concidered a fault of Church policy. Pedophilia is a sickness, something that goes beyond a mear sexual disire. If the question was how to prevent numbers of priest from having sexual relations, this might be something that could be handled by changing policy. Molesting children is not okay under any circumstances. Assuming that if we allowed priests to have sex with
other adults would remedy incidents of pedophilia is saying that it is a natural disire. The Catholic Church, as any other organization should review its policies, but preventing individuals from breaking the law and behaving inapropriately is beyond a matter of changing that policy. Actions are right or wrong beyond a rule that explicitly says so.
