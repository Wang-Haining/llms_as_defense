I do not think this is a good idea at all.  First off, how are having small amounts of this drug okay, but more of it not.  If someone is carrying a small amount on them, who's to say that they do not have a much larger supply somewhere else, such as their home or their car.  Also, having a small amount is legal, but selling the marijuana is not legal.  So in order to obtain the drug, the person must participate in these illegal activity as well.  How is having the marijuana legal, but selling it is not.
     As far as marijuana's relation to alcohol, I do not feel they are similar enough to apply all of the same rules to.  Although they are both temporary with, if controlled, not many serious long term effects, I feel marijuana is much more of a gateway to worse drugs than alcohol is.  Making marijuana legal would open the door to people trying other more serious drugs that they would not ever even considered had they not tried the marijuana.  Legalizing small amounts of this drug would boost the market for an otherwise illegal drug and aid in illegal growing and selling of marijuana.
     Marijuana should not be legalized for recreational use, however I do believe it may have a positive role in future medical use.  If this drug is controlled and given by prescription only to those that severely need it, such as cancer patients, then I certainly agree that it should be used.
