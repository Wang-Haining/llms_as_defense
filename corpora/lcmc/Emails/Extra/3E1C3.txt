I don't think that the Catholic Church necesarily has to change they way they believe, but rather the way they teach what they believe. Everything that the Catholic Church is built upon comes from the Bible, and it being such a known sacred text it is almost hard to change the way peopel feel about it. I think that the Catholic Church should still teach these rules, but let their followers do as they want with them. Most people have chosen not to abstain from sex before marriage, as the Bible and Catholic Church tells them to do. Instead of making these people feel wrong for this and condemn them for sinning, I believe that the Catholic Church should say that these actions are ok. Also with the topic of homosexuality. The Bible states that a man should not lie with another man. These leads us to think that gay people are sinners. The Catholic Church should still teach what the Bible says, but still allow the contrary. I believe that this would help the Catholic Church adapt to life in the 21st century.
