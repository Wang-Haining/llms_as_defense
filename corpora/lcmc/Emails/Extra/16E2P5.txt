I do not feel like this was an invasion of privacy because the internet is something that anyone has access to. To post something on myspace is the same thing as telling the whole world. By preventing the shooting by looking what was said on myspace i feel that the school was doing the right thing. I  do not feel like it was an invasion of privacy because the internet is not private, you have to know that ocne you put something on the internet that someone might see it. School officials should draw the line the same way the government does as long as they are not infringing upon anyones constitutional rights what they are doing is fine.
