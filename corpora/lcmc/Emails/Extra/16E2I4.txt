Originally i was a strong supporter of the war but now as it has gone on i feel like no matter what we do over in Iraq there is nothing that we can do to help the people, because they themselves do not want to be helped. I feel  like the war has gone on way to long. I think it is time to get out Iraq and just cut our loses. It is stupid to stay in Iraq.
