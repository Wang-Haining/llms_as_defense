The war in Iraq has been controversial to say the least, and it is a war that has really drawn mixed emotions from most of the American population.  My  personal opinion about the war, along with a large percentage of the population, has changed from the start of the war until now.  At first, it seemed like a necessary move to take in order to fight an end to terrorism.  With 9/11 fresh in our minds, invading Iraq seemed like a plan that would help our country, and many countries abroad, and bring an end to the terrorism that has causes disasters both at home and overseas.  We caught Saddam Housein (sp?), have taken down many other high ranking enemies, however, nothing has seemed to improve.  More and more young lives are taken everyday, more are sent to the Middle East, and it just seems like nothing is improving.  There are no signs that the war will be wrapping up anytime soon, and it just seems more obvious everyday that this is a war that cannot be won.  When one high ranking terrorist is taken out, ten more appear almost instantly. 
    Although I must say I was 100% for the war back in 2001/2002, I now must admit this war has gone on long enough and there is no reason to stay over there.  The leaders of our country must recognize this and not continue to fight because that was the decision they made in the beginning, but must pull the troops out and do what is best for the country.
