I beleive that gay marriage should be allowed.  While there are religious implications to this, I feel that if church and state are completely separated, then gay marriage could happen.  It is the fault of our country that we turn our faces away from recognizing the love between two members of the same sex.
 Church and state are supposed to be separated,but in our country, we have failed to do this.  Religious morals still seep their way into our laws. President Bush is completely wrong to make an amendment against gay marriage.  He is trying to be a "good Christian," but in fact, he is being a terrible one.   Christians have been taught by Christ to "love thy neighbor."  By denying the neighbor's right to happiness, he isn't upholding Christian values.  This is cruel, and isn't justified.  It is from the Christian roots of our country that our definition of marriage comes about.   It is stated that it is supposed to be between a woman and man, but if this is from biblical teachings, then it should not be
incorporated into the law.
   I feel that since marriage is a sacrament, then it shouldn't be used.  If marriage isn't mentioned, and terms such as "civil union" are used, then maybe the concept would be so much more acceptable.  We must eliminate religious factors from our system.  The federal government shoudl not be involved in this issue, for they do not have the right to tell people who they should love.  The only factor they should play is establishing a term and set of rights for those under a civil union.  The term marriage should be eliminated, even from those unions between a man and a woman, if this really has to be done correctly.  Everyone deserves the right to love and be loved, and shouldn't feel shame for it because their country disproves.  This is wrong to do to people, and our country nees to realize this.
