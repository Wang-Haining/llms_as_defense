Gender discrimination is very much an issue in today's culture.  This not only exists for women, but for men also.  This is due to sterotypes that are engrained in our minds.  By changing the way we think about certain genders, a difference can be made.
 In the workplace, women are definately discriminated against.  In the same job and position, men still make more money than women.  There is still a stigma that women should stay at home, because they are not able to handle high powered jobs.  Women aren't as likely to be chosen to be a CEO, for men still believe they aren't capable.  I once read this book that was supposed to help women achieve more in the workplace.  The book contained advice such as, "Don't act emotional when problems arise," or "Don't overdecorate your office."  In other words, to achieve a high place, act like a man.  The stigma that women aren't as competent still exists.
 In female-dominated jobs, men are discriminated against.  An example would be nursing.  Whenever a male nurse is mentioned, this is perceived as odd.  There is even a movie that makes fun of a character who is a male nurse. In the workplace, i'm sure male nurses are looked upon questionably by patients and female nurses, for they don't belong. 
This is due to sterotypes that have alsted for so long.  If we changed our way of thinking, this discrimination wouldn't exist any more. Of course, it is hard to change poeple's mind, but if more poeple kept going against the status quo, slowly this can be changed. One day, it might be normal to see a male nurse or a female president.
