 Legalization of marijuana is good in that it affords more freedom to the individual American.  The problem then lies with the individual as to weather or not they would like to use the substance.  Individual reactions to marijuana, although behaving the same way chemically, have an individual response in the way long term use effects the user. I feel that the difference between alcohol and marijuana in "small amounts" is negligible. It is the individual's resposibility to know if their judgements have been impared in the same way as it is with alcohol.
 The only concern with legalization is that it might be concidered a governmental approval of the action. It is important that we understand that this would be only a removal of restriction. In my personal case I would not choose to exercise that right given the chance.
