I have no personal experience with gay marriage, but I do not feel that the White House or President Bush is more qualified than I am to legislate over gay marriages.

I was brought up in a house that stressed that two people who love each other should be together.  My family is Catholic and personally does not support gay marriage because of the Church's beliefs on the topic of procreation.  However, so what if two people who love each other happen to be of the same sex?  If that is what makes them happy, then that is all that matters and no one else should be involved in that relationship.

I personally do not think that unions between gay people can be called marriages though because they are not able to have children of their own. But that is a matter that is recognized within a Church.  As far as the state or the nation is concerned, legal unions are recognized between two people who have decided to join their lives.  There is no reason this should exclude gay couples.

I don't believe either side of this argument is wrong because it is a
matter of personal beliefs, however it is wrong top step in on the lives
of others and believe you have the authority to rule over what they want
to do and what the want to commit to.  No one is allowed to tell someone
that they are not legally friends with another, so why should the federal
government be allowed to say two people cannot be legally recognized as a
couple who has committed their lives to one another?  That should be
celebrated that they want to have such a commitment, not banned.
