This is another topic that I feel should happen. If marijuana where to be legalized it would not only provide some medical benefits that the drug has but it would also lesson the burden that is currently being felt in the state prisons. Of course marijuana is a drug and if they handle its use and regulations witht the same laws that they handle alcohol, i dont not see a problem on why the legalization of marijuana would have any affect on society.
