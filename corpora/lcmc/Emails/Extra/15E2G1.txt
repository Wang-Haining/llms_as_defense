The key issue in the debate that both sides tend to overlook is the difference between a "civil union" and a "marriage".  While a civil union would give legal rights, it has no religious ceremony attached to it—it is performed by a Justice of the Peace or some other official.  A marriage is a combination of a civil union and religious ceremony-- the couple is married in the eyes of the Church (or Temple, I assume, as the case may be), as well as in the eyes of the state.  Many who are opposed to gay marriage solely on the grounds that it is a "desecration of a holy sacrament" might be content with a middle ground of civil unions—no religion is involved, only a guarantee of rights that heterosexuals take for granted.
     Personally, however, I feel that completely banning any sort of rights, whether for gay and lesbian individuals or members of any other sort of minorty, is outright wrong.  It's a grand irony that the constitution of the United States, the first ten amendments to which are commonly known as the Bill of RIGHTS, might now be used as the very means to deny rights to people just because of their sexual orientation.  If the federal government is to be involved, it should not be in a manner of church—for instance, saying that all religious organizations in the US must allow gay and lesbian couples to marry-- but in matters of state, and in such a way that it protects the rights of gay and lesbian couples.  Any sort of amendment involving "marriage" at all would be wrong (whether permitting it or denying it), for the reason of separation of church and state listed above.  An amendment _granting_ and _protecting_ the right to civil unions of same-sex couples, however, can and should be passed.
