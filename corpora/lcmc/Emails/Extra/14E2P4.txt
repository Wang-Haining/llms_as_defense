Privacy is a very important issue that every citizen deserves the right to.  It is a major part of our Constitution and must be protected.  Many cases involve privacy issues where ones privacy was invaded, however, this is not one of them.  Myspace, as far as I know, is a website that is open to the public.  As long as one registers for a username, they are free to look at any profile on the site.  When someone register and accepts the terms of agreement, I am sure there is wording in this statement that says their content is not protected from anyone to see it.  When anyone posts their information on this kind of website, they must know it is open for anyone to see it.  They might as well write it across their shirt.  That all being said, I do not believe looking on someone's myspace account is an invasion of privacy, whether they are preventing a school shooting or just looking at the person's interests.
     Now this issue with privacy pertaining to school shootings is a very extreme case.  As far as privacy goes for this, I feel that school officials must be very defensive, and not agressive.  By this I mean, it should not be legal for them to go searching through a student's belongings, emails, etc. with no reason.  I think that if there is some evidence or suspicion leaning towards certain activities, they should do all they can to avoid a disaster such as a school shooting.  This would require legal proceedings such as a warrant in order to do these searches, but in this case, I do not believe it would be invading privacy.  Their job is to protect the public, and it is better to be safe than sorry.
