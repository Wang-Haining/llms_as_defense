 The war in iraq was started in a vague attempt to stop terrorist activity.  We have been fighting this war for several years now, and as of yet, we have not heard of any major successes, nor a plan for future action.  The only information we recieve in the news is reports on the number that are dying.  Unless we can outline a strategy for success, with clear benchmarks, the war should be ended. It has gone on long enough.
