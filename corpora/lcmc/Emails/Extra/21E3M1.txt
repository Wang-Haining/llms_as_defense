I do not believe that marijuana should be legalized.  Marijunana is a drug, which can be very addicting.  Legalizing marijuana is like spreading addiction to all.  Because its legal, people will think that its ok to use the drug.  There are many bad effects that will
come of this.
  First off, like alcohol, marijuana changes one's perception.  So, the number of accidents will rise, just like drunk-driving.  There will be more deaths as result.  There will have to be another law enacted about not using drugs to drive, and scale will have to be formulated when police pull people over on the road to measure for drug use.  This just
brings up too many problems.
 Another problem is that the use will rise amongst people, especially adolescents.  Like alcohol, because adolescents aren't old enough to have it, they will try to get the drugs just because its "forbidden."  The "black market" will remain, but for adolescents now.
 I do not beleive that the affects of alcohol and cigarettes are comparable to marijuana.  Marijuana is addictive, unlike alcohol. This will increase the need for rehabs and support groups.  Alcohol is also more "socially acceptable" and i do not feel comfortable with seeing others smoke marijuana daily.  Drugs are still at a taboo status with our society, and it should remain that way.  Drugs ruin people's lives, and shouldn't be incorporated into daily life.
