To, be honest, I have not followed the war in Iraq very closely. I do know, however, that many are pushing to bring our troops back home.As wonderful as that would be, I feel that because the United States started this war, we should finish it. Pulling out of a mess of a war just because it didn't go as well as planned, does not mean we should just quit. I do realize, however, that the tragic violence that our troops are subjected to while in Iraq is horrible. In my opinion, the United States should try a different strategy instead of using violence. At this point, we should be making a more diplomatic approach to solving Iraq's problems and assisting them in any way we can to make it a more peaceful country. This violent war in Iraq has gone on too long and the death tolls of our soldiers keeps rising. Our government needs to find a more diplomatic and less violent way to end this war.
