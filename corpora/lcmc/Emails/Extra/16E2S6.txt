I feel like gender discrimination is still a huge factor in today's society.  The problem is that there is nothing that we can do change this. People are who they are and if they dont want to change there is nothing that we can do about it. Gender descrimination is something that takes place on a personal level you either do it or you dont so the best anyone can do it to incourage for it not to happen but if people dont want to change then it will continue to take place. I feel like women are discriminated against all the time in the workplace and in other circumstances also. I do not feel like men are discriminated against in the workplace although it does take place on a whole i would say that it is pretty much non-existent.
