First, I must say that it's more applicable to compare marijuana to cigarettes-- both are based on the same principle of smoking dried plant leaves.  However, cigarettes contain ingredients found in fertilizers and rat poison.. yet they are freely available to be purchased by anyone over the age of eighteen.  While the only sort of dependence that can be formed on marijuana is that of a state of mind, there is truly a chemical addiction to cigarettes (specifically, nicotine).  Because of the amount of time that cigarettes have been a part of everyday life, however, more people are more agreeable to cigarettes than to marijuana.  Legalization of marijuana would also lead to regulation of it, thus reducing the risk of tampering with it that would cause more damage than just marijuana.
   The formation of a dependency is also true of alcohol, except that in the case of alcohol, there's the building up of a tolerance.  If you get drunk on a regular basis, it will eventually take more and more alcohol to get you to that same point of euphoria-- while your blood alcohol level will be much closer to that of an overdose.  This doesn't even take into account the negative effects of alcohol on the lives of those close to alcoholics.  Do you see groups for Adult Children of Marijuana Smokers?  No, you see support groups for the children of _alcoholics_.  While it is possible to let any drug get in the way of more important things such as family, social life, and work, those drugs (such as alcohol and cigarettes) that form chemical addictions and exhibit signs of withdrawal when "quitting" are much, much more dangerous.  Alcohol, especially due to the dependency and possibility of overdose, is much more dangerous than marijuana, especially when the marijuana is in small amounts.
    Basically, I'm in favour of this.  Legalization will presumably lead to fewer problems with tampering, and the risks for marijuana, when compared to cigarettes and alcohol, are minimal.
