I feel that gender discrimination is definately still an issue in the present-day United States.  It is no doubt much improved since past decades, but it is still around in some forms.  This is something that is difficult, or maybe impossible, to eliminate completely, but if everyone continues to improve as individuals, signs of gender discrimination will be less and less.
    A big way to change or eliminate this discrimination is to teach children the right way early on.  If children are brought up to see everyone as an individual, not to judge people, and see everyone as equal, then they will continue to act this way as they grow older.  If the children grow up and see everyone as euqals as they are, discrimination should not even be thought of.
    I feel as though both women and men are discriminated against in the workplace.  It depends on the circumstance and situation, but both are definately victims or discrimination.  The stereotype often used is that men are given higher positions and better salary than women, and this causes discrimination against both sides.  Women may be discriminated because of this by not being promoted because the notion is that they are not as suited as the man they are competing with.  This may also create discrimination toward men because some people feel they need to force against this and promote certain women without giving their male counterpart a fair chance.  Both of these situations can be easily avoidable if everyone sees the person as an individual and does not stereotype them with the group they belong to.
