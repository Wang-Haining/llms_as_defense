Although the gender discrimination problem has improved greatly over the past few decades, it is still an issue. In my experience, which is, however, limited - there are equal opportunities for both men and women concerning the workplace. Women have broken into the male-dominated careers of business and science. How they are treated by their collegues in these areas, however, I do not know. I am sure that it is very difficult being a female in a male-dominated industry. Additionally, the experiences of women in these industries probably range from being treated as an equal to being treated like dirt. Racial discrimination, in my opinion, is a worse problem in the workplace than gender discrimination.
In every day life, I do believe that the issue of gender discrimination is still a problem.The idea that "You can't do this because you're a girl" or "because you're a boy" is frequently set in the minds of children. Therefore, in order to solve this issue of gender discrimination, children should be learning, both at home and at school, from an early age to treat everyone equally. If these children are raised to believe in gender equality, they will generally continue to believe in it the rest of their lives. This then helps to solve the problem with gender discrimination in the workplace.
