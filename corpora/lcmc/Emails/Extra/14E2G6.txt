The issue of gay marriage is a very important oen throughout our country right now, and there are many mixed feelings about it.  While I am one who believes that marriage is a special union between a male and female, I do not particularly agree with the whole marriage aspect.  I believe marriage is more than just loving each other and living together, but a sacred connection and start of raising a family.  This being said, there is no reason why two males or two females should be denied the right to live together, be considered a couple, and wreap some of the benefits that other couples do.  For this reason, I think gay unions should definitely be allowed and not be banned.  If two people, regardless of their gender, feel like they are meant for each other, who are the government to say that they are not allowed to be a couple.
     Growing up in a Catholic family and attending Catholic schools throughout
my life, I have learned much about the topic of marriage and feel it is definatelty meant for one man and one woman.  I have mixed feelings in this topic because I feel like two gay people do have the right to be together, however, it should not be marriage that unites them but some other connection.  I do not believe, however, that the federal government has the right to state that these two people cannot be together.
