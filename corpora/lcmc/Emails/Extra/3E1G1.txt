I believe that the fight over gay marriage and if it is worng or right should not even exist. I firmly believe that marriage should just between a man and a woman. I don't think love should just be either. Homosexuality is a natural thing, in my belief, and has been for centuries. It's hard to be believe how different our present day thoughts on homosexuality is to Ancient Greece. In those days, it was very common for a two people of the same sex to be in a relationship. It was considered natural. I don't understand how people today can have such a prejudice against homosexuals and gay marriage and think that marriage is only meant for heterosexual couples. If this is true, how come over 50% of marriages end in divorce? I think that President Bush's push for constitutional amendment for banning gay marriage is wrong. American Democracy was built upon hearing the voice of the people and if those people are homosexual and want to be married, than it should be heard. I think that the only way the federal government should be involved in this issue is if they make gay marriage legal.
