Certain stereotypes and preconceptions for each gender have been
developing since the beginning of time. Men are suited to do this, and
women are suited to do that. I feel that as of recently, there is more
uniformity for people not depending on their gender. Men tend to have the
"higher-up" jobs in companies today, but there seems to be a rise in the
amount of women in power. Afterall, a woman is ahead in the democratic
primary polls and will most likely win the democratic nomination, and in
my opinion most likely become president. Powerful female figures such as
Hillary Clinton seem to be on the rise. Nancy Pelosi is currently the
speaker of the house, a very powerful position in the most powerful
country in the world. It is not that these two women account for the
majority of the female population, but this is still a sign in that it has
never been the case before.
I have also observed that in many colleges today, including my own, female
students outnumber male students. If this trend persists in the direction
it is heading, which will most likely be the case, desirable jobs in the
future will probably be taken up by females rather than mostly males, as
it is now.
If things head in this same general direction, then I feel gender
equalization is not as far off as some may think.
