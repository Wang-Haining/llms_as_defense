I do think that gender discrimination is still present in the UniteStates. Though the status of women in workplaces and in colleges have drastically increased in the past decades, I still believe that there is a sort of negativity surrounding women. I think that the US culture is a male-dominated one. It is male-identified and centered. Traits that desribe a succesful person are usually associated with men. Top stories in newspapers, movie plots, and books are normally centered around men. And this definately translates to the workplace. I think that even if a woman is extremely intelligent, she is still associated with emotions that women stereotypically possess. I think that women are always seen as people who can't take charge and don't have strong enough minds to be authoritative. And when they are seen as strong, they are known as masculiine. I think that the most successful, highclass woman can stilled by harassed on the street by a  much less successful, lower class construction worker, and it would be deemed ok because men always have the upper hand on women. I think the only thing that could change this is time and a continuation in the increase of powerful jobs and positions for women.
