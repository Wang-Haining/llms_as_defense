I think that marijuana should be legalized in the US, but still have some laws about it, such as: the amount a person has on them, who it is being grown by, who is allowed to sell it. I think if a person has an amount of marijuana on them that exceeds a certain allowed amount, they should be fined. This will atleast set a limit in some way. I think that the people who legally grow marijuana should be government picked. This opens the door for punishing the people who are trying to abuse the legalization of marijuana and get money out of it. I also think marijuana should be bought at special places, like alcohol stores, to eliminate the interaction with the buyer and illegal dealer, which can often lead to confrontation. I think that marijuana is a much safer drug than alcohol, proved by statistics. Thousands upon thousands of people are killed each year because of drunk drivers. The people who are killed by drivers who have smoked marijuana are incomparable. No one has died from an overdose of marijuana while there have been thousands of deaths caused from alcohol poisoning. When comparing the effects of marijuana, an illegal drug, to alcohol, a legal drug, it is surprising that they are the way they are.
