I do not feel like the Catholic church needs to change it ways to apply to life int eh 21st century. This is a basic stance for me becuase the catholic  church has been around for almost two thousand years based off basic principles and morals, why would they feel need the change now when it is nto soemhting that needs to be changed. People chose what to believe in and to follow if they do not want to follow the Catholic Churhc then
dont do it they do not need to change. I dont know of the acts of pedo[philia could have been prevented if priests were allowed to be married but i do feel that they should be
allowed to be married. If the catholic church holds marriage as on of its most important sacraments and as something that briungs you closer to unity with God why wouldnt they allow some of ther most devout followers to marry?
