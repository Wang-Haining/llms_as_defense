One of my friends told me about an ethics seminar he was required to attend for one of his business classes.  The topic was discrimination in the workplace.  It gave a present-day view as to how different genders, races, and religions are treated in today's workforce.  What he told me really surprised me.

He said a lot of businesses would prefer to hire men over a woman who is equally qualified if both applicants are young adults.  The only reason for this is that the woman "might" become pregnant and have to take maternity leave.  What a biased remark!  She "might" become pregnant?  Well, the man might "die" one morning too!  The company's that target such applicants do not want to look for replacements while an employee is on leave because of expenses.  Generalizing that all woman could become pregnant at the drop of a ball is unfair and unjust.  Just because a possible employee is a woman does not mean she is anywhere near looking to start a family in the near future or ever in some cases.

I believe gender discrimination still exists in the United States today, but it is no longer aimed at a specific gender.  It all depends on the company's goals.  My dad was denied a promotion that he had been awaiting when a woman suddenly relocated to his office and got the job instead.  The company believed it woukld look better in their numbers to have more women in leadership positions to keep up with the times.

I believe the best way to prevent gender discrimination is by disregarding any information about gender.  Applications should not even ask gender.  Even in a college setting, where affirmative action is running rampant, a less-qualified minority can get in to college often times easier than a white, male student simply becuase the school would prefer to market its diversity to today's culture which demands such action.  It doesn't matter what gender a person is.  The only thing that should matter is if he or she has the skills to do the job.
