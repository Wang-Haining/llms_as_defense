I believe that gay marriage is something that should be legalized all over the United States. It is not right that just because someone is a homosexual that they can not express there love for another individual in the same why a heterosexual person can by getting married. I feel like that states that are stopping themselves form legalizing it need to
seriosuly consider the downside to it. There in reality is not con to legalizing gay marriage. The sanctity of marriage only unifys two people why can't those two people be of the same sex.
