 Gay marriage is the public exclamation that you have found, in another human being, something that is special. The idea that you would like to tell the world of your love for another, and that that person is special to you beyond all others is a beutiful one. It is wrong to prevent people from expressing this concept.  Marriage here refers to the status that allows governmental benifits to those couples. This does not refer to the sacremental right of some religions.  It is wrong for the federal government to impose its policy in a manner that separates a class of people from the general population. Bush is wrong for pushing for a constitutional ammendment. Doing so would underline a belief that all people are not created equal, and that some do not have the right to pursue happiness even though it does not inhibit that some right in others.
