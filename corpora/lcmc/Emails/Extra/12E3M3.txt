The legalization of marijuana in Denver is not very significant. The city officials of Denver realized a large part of the community uses marijuana for various purposes and found that legalizing its usage could lead to possible added revenue. Through legalization, it is easier for the city of Denver to monitor the sale and usage of marijuana and prevent it from ending up in the hands of children or teenagers. Marijuana is an illegal substance, but the city of Denver is exploring different measures for controlling its usage and sale.
