Unfortunately, there is a fine line between the invasion of privacy and safety precautions in this situation. I believe, however, when it comes to students' safety in schools, the best security is needed. Even if this does mean there is a slight invasion of privacy, if it means protecting innocent students, it's worth it. The recent and too frequent school shootings are extremely upsetting and hard to handle. It is scary to think that someone is so mentally unstable to even think of bringing a gun to school and killing innocent people. No matter how much a person is bullied or teased, there is never any need for violence. As for the situation explained in the question, about the myspace bulletin, I do not believe the school was wrong in looking at this bulletin. Even though some may believe this is an invasion of privacy - which is worse, an invasion of privacy or a school shooting? It seems to me that slightly crossing the line of privacy is worth preventing a school shooting. Addtionally, when that student posted his myspace bulletin, he put it on the internet for anyone to read. Anything posted on the internet can be seen by thousands of people, so how private was this bulletin really?
It is difficult for schools to decide as to where to draw the line, because their students' safety is so important. I believe that student need to contribute more to school safety in order to help stop school shootings. Students should be more aware of their classmates. If a student feels that another classmate is a threat (with good evidence), this student should bring his concerns to the school. Provided that the student's concerns are reasonable and there is logical evidence, the school can proceed with solving this issue before it is too late. I believe that schools should be able to slightly invade students' privacy if necessary to keep the student body safe.
