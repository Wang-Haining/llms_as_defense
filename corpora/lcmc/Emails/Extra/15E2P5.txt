People do not realize that something put on a public domain, i.e., the internet, is public.  It's not an invasion of privacy when someone is stupid enough to tell all their friends that they're going to shoot the school on a completely public forum.  The same is true of webshots galleries or other such things-- people at Loyola are complaining that shots of them with buckets of jungle juice in a freshman residence hall posted under an account with the same name as their school e-mail are being unfairly used against them.  The gallery is public-- anyone can see it.  The people in the photos can clearly be identified.  Contrary to popular student belief, administrators or school officials don't troll Facebook or Myspace to see when there's a party going on, or search for "Loyola Toga Parties" under Google and see what incriminating photos come up.  Even then, that is not an invasion of privacy.  It's the same concept as making thousands of copies of your diary and stapling them to telephone poles around the city, and complaining when people actually read them.  The only way that this would be an invasion of privacy, in this example, is if someone other than you took your diary, made the photocopies, and distributed them.  Since you were the one who photocopied your diary in the first place, it's completely and totally your own fault.  The same is with the pictures, the facebook invites, the myspace bulletins-- it's your own stupid fault for not understanding the idea of a public medium.  Since the administrators did not take your camera or your planner or other private information and put it on the internet, it is not their fault, and not an invasion of privacy.
    The information was volunteered and broadcast on a public medium; thus, it is no longer private, and can't be an invasion of privacy.
