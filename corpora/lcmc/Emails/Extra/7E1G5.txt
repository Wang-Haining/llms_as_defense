I personally, do not agree with homosexuality, but I do believe that these people have the right to get married. Just because these people are homosexuals does not mean they are not human beings. America is supposed to be a country that treats everyone with equal rights. Although homosexuality has been shunned and banned in the past, times are changing and it needs to be accepted. The idea that President Bush is pushing for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is absurd. Homosexuals should share the same rights as every other citizen in the Unites States. How can this country let one aspect of a person, their sexual preference, define who they are? Limiting someone's natural born rights as a citizen of this country simply because of their sexual preference is unjust and irrational. A man or woman could be one of the greatest people God has blessed this earth with, but because they are homosexual, they can't do something as natural in life as get married?
