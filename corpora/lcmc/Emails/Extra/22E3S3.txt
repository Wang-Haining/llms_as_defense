 Gender discrimination is an issue in present day United States. Sexual harrassment charges are still being filed today, and this behavior spawns from the same generalizations as those that foster gender discrimination.  Typically women are the victims of this crime, because there are significantly less situations in which women are in a discision making position over men.  The point here is that people who make generalizations based on gender or any other surface characteristic can be of either sex. Also, the only reason women aren't discriminating against men is because, perhaps through the same discrimination, women have not been put in a place of authority.  The solution to gender discrimination is education of the people who commit this crime.  They need to learn that the way in which they evaluate people is incorrect.
