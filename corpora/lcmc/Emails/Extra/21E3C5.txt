The Catholic church needs to adapt to nowaday life.  I beleive that they have unrealistic expectations of its followers to still believe everything they beieve.  They need to reconnect with the issues of today, or it could lose its followers.   As for the issue of pedophilia, this could definately be solved by allowing priests to marry.  If preists can marry, then the interest in the job would probably increase, for I'm sure this is a factor as to why not many men choose to go into the priesthood. This way, churches can be more choosy about who they want, decreasing the probability of having an inept preist.  The priesthood would attract more family-oriented men, who don't have the desire to hurt chldren.  Also, allowing women to become priests would help this situation also.  This
not only increases the pool of priests to choose from, but you will also have mothers in the population.  By having maried men and women, the chances of having someone who is a pedophile is lowered.  The church also needs to adapt to the new technologies of today.  Millions of people could benefit from the use of stem cells, yet the church turns itself away from it.  The church needs to recognize the ever-changing values of our society, and realize what's good for the society.
  If the church doesn't realize that they are still stuck in the past, i beleive that it could lose a lot of members.  Many catholics participate in  stem cell research, no matter what their church says.  The more the church stays stuck in their ways, the more its members
will ignore them.
