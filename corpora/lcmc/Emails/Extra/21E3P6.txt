I believe that there is a thin line between snooping into one's personal life, and protecting others for the greater good.  School officials should do their job, which is to protect others.   Myspace bulletins are open for all to see.  If someone posts something, they know that anyone can view it, and everyone has the right to view it.  By posting something on the bulletin and a school official reading it, I do not beleive that this was an invasion of privacy.  In fact, this was to protect the students, which is a component of their job.  Therefore, this is completely fine.
 As for where to draw the line, i believe that only a list of suspected students should be checked up on.  Browsing through profiles, looking at their pictures, looking at their friends, is an invasion.  Things such as this have nothing to do with the school environment, so this doesn't concern school officials.  As  for the list of suspected students, they should be looked at only in the context of school-related activities, such a this shooting at a school.  Finding out what they will be doing Friday night is completey unneccesary and not part of the school's job.   I beleive that to save the common good it's okay to sacrifice privacy rights.  In this case, the rights should only be invaded in school-related acitivites.
