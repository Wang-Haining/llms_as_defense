The lagalization of marijuana.  An interesting concept.  One that I'm sure thousands of college kids would love to see put into action.  As a college student myself and an adamant non-smoker, I would personally not benefit at all if marijuana were legalized. I find it very interesting though that in places within our nation pot is legal.  I can't say, however that I disagree with such a measure.

Marijuana, as far as I've witnessed has similar effects to alcohol, if not more subdued.  Every person I have ever seen high would be completely content to sitting on the coach eating a bag of potato chips and falling asleep with a movie on the television.  Not too uncommon.  The only difference is their eyes are bloodshot and they have no sense of time or relation.

If marijuana was legalized, I think the use of it would actually go down.  >From what I can tell, half the excitement of getting high is the risk of getting the pot.  People love to brag about how shady the person who had the supply was, or how cheap they could get the pot for, or how expensive a "special" bag is.  The thrill of doing something illegal is invigorating to the senses.  People love to feel dangerous and test their limits.  But if marijuana were legal, that thrill would be gone because anyone could purchase it.  Smoking pot would not be so "bad-ass" or risky. Following that thought process it would be beneficial to legalize marijuana.
