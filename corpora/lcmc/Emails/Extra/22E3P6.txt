 Invasion of privacy is an increasingly important matter in todays technological age. Reading a students bullitin is not an invation of privacy as it is analgous to reading a letter someone has written you. Not acting in response to such a situation would be morally objectionable.  The line however should be drawn at some point. Scaning the internet for images of students drinking, and then punishing them for that should not be allowed.  If the percieved danger to other students or the acting student is not large, we must allow people to make decisions for themselvs. What needs to be taken into account for is weather or not, once privacy have been invaded, if we can ever achieve the previous level of privacy. We must remain aware that the freedom of privacy is an important one, and that once it has been taken away, we may not be able to give it back.
