No, I definately do not beleive that this was an invasion of privacy at all. I believe that this was an amazing thing and all participants involved should be applauded for stopping a possible violent event. I don't think that there is an exact line to be drawn when it comes to the invasion of privacy of students who use internet websites. These teenagers are posting this information for the public to see. There are sexual preditors, peodophiles, and many other people who have the tendency to harm children and they are all able to view these websites. One of the last people teenagers should be worried about seeing their personal websites is a teacher. When it comes to the internet, I don't think that there is a line to be drawn.
