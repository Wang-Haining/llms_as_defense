Yes, in some ways I do believe that the Catholic Church should change some of its ways in order to adapt to life in the 21st century. Although I am a strong believer in the Catholic faith, I do disagree with some of its rules. For instance, the issue of homosexuals and same sex marriage is shunned by the church. I believe, however, that Jesus taught us to love everyone and be kind to everyone despite our differences. The Catholic Church preaches about doing good, being kind to our neighbors, and helping those in need. Is this not a bit contradictory? Rejecting individuals just because of their sexual preference is harsh discrimination. Just because a person is homosexual, it does not define them. There are so many other qualities to a person, but the Church does not consider this. All they consider is that homosexuality is sin, so they reject gays and lesbians. But aren't we all sinners? Isn't that why Jesus died on the cross for us? So that we sinners could be forgiven by God? Concerning the pedophilia and sexual abuse, I think it is impossible to say if these things would have happened if the church had changed certain rules. But I do believe that in the 21st century, the Catholic Church should allow priests to marry. There are so few young men willing and devoted enough to be priests that it has become a problem. I believe, however, that if the church allowed priests to marry, more men would be interested in becoming a priest. Marriage is such a wonderful sacrament, and I do not believe the Catholic Church should prohibit their priests from experiencing it.
