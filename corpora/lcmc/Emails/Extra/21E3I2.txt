I feel that this war has gone on for much more than needed, because there wasn't a good reason for it to begin in the first place.  I feel that president Bush is fulfilling his father's past goals, instead of looking out for his country.
 Our country was attacked by Osmam Bin Laden, yet we are currently attacking another.  Bush has not supplied our country with a good reason, but went ahead with the war.  Why not attack who attacked us?  Could it have somethig to do with the fact that the Bin Laden family has money invested in our country?  For whatever reasonign Bush had for
going to war, it did not have to do with protecting our country.  Now, our soldiers are dying for no reason.  Not only are soldiers dying, but innocent civilians also, making America look like a merciless country.  This war is being called "another Vietnam."  Do we really want this to happen?  A whole generation of soldiers wasted?  There is no good reason to go to war.  The only effects that it is having is killing off soldiers, and if a draft is enacted, young men and women of our country.  We should withdraw from this horrid war, and look into protecting our country.  Millions of dollars are being wasted on supplies and weapons to do nothing overseas.  We could be using that money for protecting our borders and airports. President Bush has made a horrid decsion, and should retract it immediately.
