The school shooting that was prevented because school officials saw a myspace bulletin is not an invasion of privacy in my mind.  What they saw and reported saved lives.  However, the topic of privacy rights is a very controversial and faint boundary.

With today's technology, billions of people can access and monitor your every action at the click of a button.  Programs like myspace lend themselves to free access for everyone to your personal information.  I believe if you put it out there, you are responsible for the consequences that may follow.  You know going into a program such as myspace that millions of others might and most likely will read your profile.  In fact, isn't that the point of myspace?  Therefore, if you choose to put threats on there, chances are someone else will read them and if they have context, attention will be called to the warning.

As for the actions of the school officials, I do not believe they invaded anyone's privacy for the reasons stated above.  But the reason they accessed the site in the first place determines truely whether or not privacy was invaded.  School officials have no place just randomly looking up students on the internet.  The only way their actions in this particular example are justified is if there was reasonable suspicion to make them believe the student may have posted a threat to the school online.  This information would have need to be received from another source.

Privacy only goes so far as the medium you put your ideas into.  Just as a published book is no longer private, the internet is most certainly not private simply because of the nature and ease of accessibility that goes along with it.  I do not think in this case that privacy was invaded because other lives were involved, but the student who wrote it should have known it could have been seen by just about anyone who wanted to see it.
