To be honest I don't know much about the war. It started when I was in eighth grade and at the age I wasn't big on politics; those feelings are still with me today. But, I do believe that if war is the necessary means we have to go through to keep our country and others safe, than it should be done. In the case of Iraq, it seems like it has been going on for so long and we haven't made much of an improvement, other than the fact that Sadaum Hussein was captured and will now be executed. I don't know if a way was needed for this though.
