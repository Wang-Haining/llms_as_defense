Personally, I do agree with the legalization of marijuana. The health effects of marijuana use are not nearly as dangerous as those effects of cigarettes and alcohol, so why is it that those are legal and marijuana is not? I do not know the exact specific health effects of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana, but I do know that cigarettes cause multiple forms of cancer and alcohol damages your liver as well as killing hundreds of brain cells. While studying the effect of drugs on the body in psychology, however, I was intrigued when I saw that the only health effects listed next to marijuana use included throat and lung irritation (as a result of chronic use). The effects listed next to alcohol and cigarettes were much more severe.
In my opinion, reasonable marijuana use certaintly has its benefits. It helps reduce stress, and in today's world, most people could use to release some stress. Additionally, marijuana use does not leave you feeling groggy and with a hang over the next morning, unlike alcohol. You also don't "black out" from smoking marijuana, unlike drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. Furthermore, there has been no solid proof that marijuana is addictive. Cigarette smoking and alcohol use, however, are addicting. Marijuana, in many senses, seems to be the better choice over alcohol.
I do realize, however, that not everyone has the same mindset as me. If marijuana is legalized, people will abuse it. And when it is abused, marijuana use is no longer a good thing. Marijuana for reasonable and responsible use, however, should be legalized.
