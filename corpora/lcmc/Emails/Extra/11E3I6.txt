I have a good friend who is about to be shipped off to Iraq in the upcoming months.  In a recent phone conversation, I asked him if he was scared.  His answer: "Yeah, I'm scared and I'm sure I'll be scared as hell when it comes time, but I want to serve my country and I'll be proud to do that."  The reality is though, that he is twenty-three years old and he could be put in the face of death.

The war in Iraq has gone on long enough.  What are we fighting for any more?  The war on terrorism is a lifelong war, that cannot be won by more acts of terrorism.  Our government needs to realize the costs of being over in the Middle East are far greater than the benefits.  Thousands of innocent lives have been lost and yet there is still war ravaging the country.

Violent actions cannot solve a problem of violence.  The only thing that can change the terror in Iraq is by trying methods of peaceful resolution. It makes me angry to think of all the guys like my young friend who are willing to stand up for the liberty and freedom that reigns in the United States,  But what they don't realize is that they are not standing up for good.  They are giving in to and participating in the same level of evil.
