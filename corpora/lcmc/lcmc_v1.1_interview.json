        "\tMarijuana is one of those things that’s still stigmatized for few legitimate reasons, and most of the reasons people feel a certain way about it are also true of alcohol. One huge, bone-crushingly important, monumental difference between the two is this: the government can and does effectively tax the manufacture and distribution of alcohol (and tobacco, for that matter). Denver has taken a step in the right direction, and maybe the only step that needs to be taken. Since people are given permission to carry only small quantities, theoretically this still legislates against large-scale wheeling and dealing while preventing cops from having to divert time and attention to minor drug busts, which are often a waste of resources. \n\tHarsh laws against marijuana indirectly place a major strain upon the law courts and prison systems, since they’re forced to deal with every trifling case of possession or distribution that comes through. The resources could be better spent elsewhere, like stopping the influx of harder drugs into the U.S., or locating meth labs. It should still be a crime to carry and sell pounds of marijuana, but I’d guess that these kinds of cases make up a very small percentage of the total number. \n\tOther drugs have risen and fallen in popularity, but marijuana has been a consistent favorite of people of all ages and backgrounds. The government is wasting its time trying to eradicate its usage, as though getting rid of pot will solve some of society’s major ills. It’s a mind-altering substance in the same way alcohol is, and last time I heard statistics cited, the number of people killed by drunk drivers was astronomically higher than the number killed those who drive while high. Also, I’ve never heard of any “angry stoners”, but there are a lot of angry and abusive drunks.\n\tI’m not advocating marijuana usage as necessarily being a good idea, but there are a lot worse ones. As with most things, it’s not that harmful in moderation; in fact, the smoke is much cleaner than that of most commercial cigarettes. The problem is that it’s stereotyped as the gateway drug of choice of all manner of social degenerates, subversives, and general ne’er-do-wells. Oh, and young people. People frequently use it in excess, of course, but the exact same could be said for Loyola students who start going to bars on Wednesday and Thursday nights during the school week.\n\tEventually, the government is going to have to confront the issue head-on, and that will be a political spectacle worth watching. Just imagine expert witnesses brought before Congress in order to testify on the nature of marijuana smoking. C-SPAN’s ratings will soar. But that’s besides the point. The point is that usage of drugs like marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco is ultimately one of personal volition and responsibility. If the negative effects of the latter two are minimal enough that we permit their widespread usage, there’s no viable reason the former shouldn’t be allowed as well. \n",
        "\tWhen the war in Iraq first began, I fully supported President Bush’s decision to send troops into the country.  With aspirations of toppling an evil dictator and recovering weapons of mass destruction, it seemed that Bush had concrete, noble objectives that were within our reach to achieve.  Both of these objectives came to a climax.  Saddam Hussein was apprehended and put to trial.  However, no weapons of mass destruction were found. Ever since then, the media has mocked Bush each and every day for sending our troops into Iraq.\n\tAt this time, it would be in our country’s best interests to pull out of Iraq.  We have been over there for several years, and even though we have made some progress towards bringing democracy to the people of Iraq, the development is coming to a screeching halt.  My brother joined the Marine Corps after the war started, and he has already returned from his second tour of duty there.  However, many of our soldiers are not as fortunate as my brother.  Every day we hear of more and more casualties.  This continuous, fruitless war, with fighting that leads to more deaths and less progress, is drastically hurting the morale of our nation at a time when we need it most.  We need to accept the fact that even though we have captured Saddam Hussein, the people of Iraq are not going to change.\n",
        "\tI am a member of the facebook.com.  For me it has been an open forum for meeting friends at my school, getting in tough with old high school friends, and of course maybe grabbing a screen name or a phone number of the cute girl that sits next to me in class.  However, last year one of my friends was suspended for one game of his lacrosse season because in one of his facebook pictures he was holding a beer and he is not of the age.  How did he get in trouble?  Our athletic director has a facebook account under some fake name and decided to check my friend’s pictures.  This is an invasion of privacy on multiple levels.  First of all he is using a false identity to look at pictures of college students he knows performing illegal deeds after the fact.  The police couldn’t even have arrested my friend for drinking but our AD can suspend him.  Moreover, where is the line to be drawn?  Our lives are already monitored to a heartbeat here at Loyola, we are given luxurious apartments along with freedom from our parents for the first time in our lives, and then immediately reprimanded by RA’s and prick resident directors for entertaining the idea of beer before we are 21.  \n\tThat all being said I am in favor of finding out about a bomb threat through myspace.com.  As far as I am concerned if it saves lives it is alright by me.  That doesn’t mean I want my house to be wire tapped.  But if I had written on my front lawn that I am going to bomb a building than it would be ok to do some fly by surveillance.  Our government’s role is to protect and to serve its citizens, not to be overbearing and intrusive.  It is my belief that our president should have been impeached for his role in the wire tapping of certain American citizens following the terror attacks on 9/11.  It is just sad that our privacy had to be impinged upon as retaliation for our government not being informed enough about the acts that lead up to 9/11.  \n\tIn our schools, privacy should be permitted to a certain degree where a principals or a deans discretion being used to make final decisions.  Lockers and emails should be accessible for investigation if need be, but under no circumstances should our phone conversations be recorded.  Myspace and facebook transcend both phone and email conversations.  They are open forums for freedom of speech for my generation.  \n",
        "      When it comes to the legalization of marijuana, I have long felt and continue to feel that there is really no reason to continue this useless war against the drug.  Most of the anti-marijuana campaigns I have witnessed have few to no facts backing their claims and are more aimed at using emotional impact or bandwagon propaganda techniques in order to convince their viewers that smoking marijuana is an evil.  The latest anti-marijuana commercial I have seen is just a girl and her dog, and the dog complains to the girl that she’s not the same when she smokes.  This is perhaps the most ridiculous commercial I have ever seen.  Without a single fact or figure in the entire commercial, are we supposed to be moved by a talking dog?  A little critical thinking about this might provoke the idea that the reason commercials avoid using concrete evidence is because there isn’t any.  When the facts are really examined, this becomes more and more evident.  As far as long term effects go, there is little scientific proof linking marijuana with later health problems such as cancer, in fact the good marijuana does by healing patients of glaucoma and alleviating the symptoms of other diseases seems to contradict the evils of long term effects.  Besides, do long term effects really hold any say in today’s economy?  The evils of the tobacco and food industries do more harm than marijuana could ever do.\n\tSo it must be the short term effects that the anti-marijuana advocates have such a problem with.  However, how are the effects of marijuana any more severe than those of alcohol?   When taken in moderation, neither drug is particularly harmful.  When taken responsibly, neither one is a real danger.  However, when abused and taken in excess, the effects of marijuana are far less severe than alcohol.  An “overdose” of alcohol can lead to alcohol poisoning, blacking out, or ultimately death.  However, it is physically impossible to smoke enough to weed to overdose.  Besides, there’s a definite point where one really can’t smoke anymore.  In fact, there’s never been a documented death due to marijuana overdose.  The closest hospital trips due solely to marijuana are for dehydration, which shouldn’t even be a problem when the drug is taken responsibly.\n\tSo all that is left to examine really is the side effects of the drug, or rather everything surrounding the use of the drug, from what one might do while intoxicated, to the burgeoning drug culture surrounding marijuana.  As for actions taken while intoxicated, this is 100% correlated with the responsibility of the user.  If an intoxicated person decides to drive, this is no worse than drinking and driving, if not better.  But it is also still 100% the user’s decision to drive.  Sure, marijuana might impair one’s judgment, but it does not impair one’s sense of social responsibility.  If one decides to drive while intoxicated, they probably are missing the sense of responsibility not to drive intoxicated in the first place.  It is not the drug’s fault, but the fault of the driver.  This is why keeping the substance controlled and sold in moderation is a good idea.  It keeps the supply in the hands of legitimate business and out of the pockets of drug dealers, and while this may make the drug more easily available to those underage, it will effectively make the drug safer for use, limit the quantity available, and remove some of the mystique surrounding an illegal drug.  In effect, legalizing the drug will provoke users to be more responsible with it, as shown in cases in Europe, where the drug is legal in certain countries. \n\n",
        "1. LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA:  The city of Denver has decided to legalize small amounts of marijuana for persons over 21.  How do you feel about this?  Do you feel that marijuana and its effects are similar enough to alcohol that it should be legal?\n\n\n\tI do not really know how I feel about the legalization of marijuana. On the one hand I have heard that studies have come out proving that alcohol is actually more harmful the pot. Under alcohol, one loosed much their inhibition and many a persons have made extremely bad judgment calls because of this. \n\tI know personally of friends who have blacked out, gotten sick, and have even had sex when they didn't mean to, all because of alcohol. I am not saying that this can not happen and does not happen with the use of weed, but I have not heard it to this extent. I also know that people can get addicted to alcohol if they are not careful, and can eventually get cirrhosis of the liver. This is a serious problem because then people have to have a liver replacement, which can take a long time to receive because of the weighting list. If they do not receive one soon enough, they death is the only other answer. Again, I have not heard of this happening with the use of marijuana, but I am not ruling it out, I have just never heard of it. \n\tI do know, that from when I have seen other people use it that they tend to act really goofy, or settle down and just sit there. I also know that just from talking with people over time that I am in contact with who do use it frequently, they do not seem to be as sharp as they used to be. I am not really sure if there has been any significant case study of this, but I feel that it tends to kill of brain cells. I would have to do more research though, before I came to any conclusions about the drug. \n\tOn a different lever outside of actually using it, I do feel that it should be legalized, because that way the government can monitor it. There are so many drug wars and gangs on the streets because of this drug, and there would be a lot less death in the inner cities because it would no longer be an underground market. Also, but regulating it, people would be sure to be getting the actual real pure substance, verses just filler or even poison mixed in with it. \n\tAnother reason why it should be legalized is because it would help to get rid of the drug war outside of the United States, namely Mexico. Mexico has some of the biggest and cruelest drug lords in all of the pot selling business. Marijuana is actually a big cash selling crop, and the drug lords monitor who grows it and how much of the crop is sold, so much so that if something is messed up along the way, of if they find someone growing it/and or selling it who should not be, then bloodshed it often the only answer. With the legalization of marijuana, these drug lords would loose a huge part of their business, because we would be able to grow the crop on our own soil, and it would no longer be illegal, so many of the workers in Mexico for the drug lords would loose their jobs. There would be no need for smugglers anymore. \n\tSo again, for these reason I am not sure if pot should be legalized or not. \n",
        "\tI am firm believer that the United States should have never embarked on any type of military intervention in Iraq.  I have always looked at war as a last resort.  If a genocide needs to be stopped, or a dictator needs to have his hand taken away from the nuclear button, then in certain situations war is the only logical outcome.  That being said I agreed with our involvement in WWII and I would have been in agreement with any military assistance we could have provided during the Rwandan genocide that the Caucasian world never lost sleep over.  But Iraq, Iraq to me was a country ruled by an iron fist dictator that we installed when it was politically correct to do so in the early 1980’s.  Before we knew it our little Seddam had emerged from his puppet role as foe to the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran was now himself the most feared dictator in the Middle East.  Our foreign policy mistake almost thirty years ago has not lead to not one but now two wars in Iraq, and perhaps even worse our occupation can now be seen as holding up the infrastructure of a nation divided. \n\tIt is tough for me as an American voter with liberal political ideologies to not feel lied to by our government.  We have perpetuated the colonialist ways of nation building though big corporations. Dick Chaney’s own company Halliburton is rebuilding the rubble that used to be called Iraq, furthermore, pip lines through Afghanistan and other Middle Eastern countries are still flowing as planned.  To me Iraq was a smoke screen that ended up accidentally blinding the ones using it for cover.  There were no weapons of mass destruction only a brutal dictator that we as a country have shared intimate ties with for decades.  We should be out of Iraq as soon as possible.  The casualties, the expenses, and the Iraqi people, all need to be taken into account at this point.  Iraq is more dangerous today than it has ever been, and now our great nation may be directly responsible for that. \t\n\tThis war has gone on longer than anyone had originally anticipated.  What was once a war backed by many UN involved countries is now a matter of US versus the world.  With Seddam in custody and literally all of his top officials dead or also captured Iraq should now have the means to begin to start over, without our help.  As long as we are involved with their elections and their economy, they will never be a free country.  Perhaps the new dictator of Iraq is George W. Bush.   \n",
        "\tOnce again, we come to an issue that many people have strong feelings on. In my previous response through the email, I believe that I had a different opinion from the one that I have now. Gay marriage is an issue that should have a 100% overall agreement. I do not believe either side is wrong in their beliefs. We are in the 20th century- times have changed and people should be more accepting of the changes in sexuality. As for President Bush’s push for an amendment to ban gay marriage, I do not agree. \n\tStudies may differ, but with others knowledge and with the information presented to me, I feel that genetics is the cause for a person to be homosexual and not heterosexual. I do not feel that it is due to a person’s environment, or they way they were brought up. This type of sexuality has existed all the way back to the time of our creation. It has always been there, people just decided to avoid the subject. I do not agree with the federal government trying to intervene in a person’s private life, especially if they are trying to decide who an individual can marry- it is ridiculous to even think about!\n\tMarriage was created to bring together a man and a woman; rules have been bent for other issues less important than gay marriage. Why are people so afraid of this change? I know I am uneasy of the idea, but I have to accept it, because we can not change a person’s genetics or who they are attracted to. The ancient philosopher Plato, described humans as beings searching for their other half. He described the original humans as beings in the shape of a ball with two pairs of sexual organs. One ball had two male organs, one ball had two female organs, and the other ball had one male organ and one female organ. When the gods feared the power of humans, Zeus split them in half; they wandered the world searching for their other half. This is how love is described, the search for our soul mate, and the search for the deep connection that we cannot describe. \n\tThe side opposing gay marriage is not wrong, they believe they are acting for the good of the people, but how do they know what is good for these people different from them. The federal government is not needed for this issue; they have greater things to worry about, and marriage is not one of them. \n",
        "\tI think that the Catholic Church is definitely stuck in the past and that it needs to adapt to the twenty first century. Judging by all the pedophilia incidents with the priests, I think that the church would be wise to adapt. We were born to be sexual creatures, and living a live of celibacy is very difficult. Also, for the sake of the reputation of the Catholic Church, it would probably be more beneficial. I find that people are beginning to associate Catholic priests with pedophilia and it is giving the church a bad name. The Catholic Church has always been known for being upstanding and righteous, and these acts definitely do not reflect that. I know that by changing this rules, the Catholic Church would be ending centuries of tradition, but considering how much the world has changed since the Catholic Church was instated, it would be a beneficial change. The Catholic Church has essentially stayed the same all of these years, and it seems that if they had been more willing to adapt and change with the times, it would have avoided many past problems and the current ones they are dealing with now. The Church also would have avoided a lot of controversy. I definitely agree that the Catholic Church’s unwillingness to change is the main reason why they are dealing with all of these problems and having these cases of pedophilia among the priests and boys in the church. By changing, it is likely that all of this would have been prevented. You do not really see any of these things occurring in churches that allow their pastors, priests or whatever to marry. \n\tAlthough making changes to the traditions of the Catholic Church is the most logical and practical thing to do, it is probably an impossible task, at least in this day and age. The fact that the Catholic Church is built on centuries of tradition makes change seem pretty far-fetched. Also, since it was started in Europe, the change would have to begin there with the Pope. Also, making changes would probably spark a lot of turmoil and disagreement because everyone is so used to the way things are. Making changes like these would completely revolutionize the Catholic religion and by be open to wanting to change; it would open the door for more things like having women priests. I don’t thing having whether or not the church has women priests is as much of an issues as allowing priests to marry. Not having women as priests has not really been the root of any problems in the Church, at least to my knowledge. Obviously having equality is important, and I not allowing women to be priests is unfair, but I personally am not really offended by it, I’m not really sure why. I think because of how strict and narrow the traditions of the Catholic are, and female priest would not be well received, at least not in the beginning. I think it would be more difficult for her to have a strong church and large congregation because I think she would be less respected because she is a woman. \n      All in all, I think that the Catholic Church has a lot of loose ends they need to tie up and problems they need to figure out how to solve so that they can avoid all the controversy and bad publicity they’ve been getting. \n",
        "\tThe war in Iraq, while aimed at respectable purpose has drawn on for too long and has become detrimental to the United States of America as well as the citizens of Iraq.  The aim of the war, on the surface anyway, is to enable to people of Iraq to escape the reigns of a harsh tyrannical ruler and experience the freedom and liberation of a democratic government.  Some feel, and I tend to think there is a hint of truth in this assumption, that George Bush’s involvement in the war stems at least partly from an ongoing family feud between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein.  \n\tThe war should have ceased after the ruler was taken from power and other insurgents and accomplices of the reign were effectively removed from their positions.  The war seems to have run on aimlessly at this point, forgetting the purpose, and failing to empower the people of Iraq.  There comes a point when the Iraqi citizens need to take power back for themselves, and I think that point has come and gone.  The United States is seeming less and less like a helpful friend to Iraq and more and more like a force on a wild, uncontrolled path towards making some political statement world-wide.\n\tEven back in the United States the war seems to cause nothing but negative effects economically and socially.  Soldier after soldier is dying for what has become a useless and drawn out cause.  It is ridiculous to think that the perpetual nature of the war is a just trade for the lives of American soldiers.  The point has been made that we want to spread democracy, and certainly there is great truth and cause in that pursuit.  The war, however, made that point a long time ago and now more and more soldiers continue to lose their lives.\n\tEconomically speaking, this war has cost the country billions and billions of dollars.  There are certainly more worthy causes for our country’s money on the home soil.  Poverty is one example of war we are trying to fight on our home turf right now, and that eighteen billion or so dollars that has been spent on the war would go a long way to aid those in need here.  We are spending an excess of money on foreign soil to aid foreign citizens when there are American who need help from all of those funds.  I do believe the spread of democracy is a just pursuit but, as I have mentioned, that purpose has long since been declared, achieved, and passed.  Democracy back in our own country calls for the aid of millions in poverty, and their cries should not go unnoticed because that is part of the democratic system.\n\t The other issue with the war in Iraq is the prioritization it was given over the war on terrorism.  Saddam Hussein was not the one that attacked our country and killed thousands of our citizens on September 11, 2001.  If we are to pursue any type of war our efforts would be more just when aimed at the end to terrorism.\n\n",
        "\tI believe that gender discrimination is still an issue in the present day United States for both men and women. I feel that women and men are equally discriminated against in the workplace. Discrimination has existed for so long in our country, I do not feel that it will be easy to rid ourselves of it. People have created their ideas and views and do not want to change them. When faced with the issue, people seem to turn their head or look the other way. \n\tYes, to an extent I do believe that there is gender discrimination in the work place. I believe that some people are set in their ways and feel that men can do a better job in a certain profession than women. I also believe that some people feel women can do a better job than men in a certain profession. I do not think that we can change this, because people will view the world the way they want to view it; it is very hard to change a persons view when they are set in their ways. Another point to this issue is that yes men and women are equal, but there are some jobs that men will do better in then women and vice versa. I do not believe this is an attack on the genders, but reality. \n\tFrom my personal experience at a job, I saw that women were treated better then the men. The women were treated as if they could do no wrong. The boys were reprimanded for when they did something wrong, even if a girl did the same thing and was never spoken to. My job was a part time job, it wasn’t serious, and so I do not know what it is like in the corporate world. Movies will portray discrimination in the work place for both sexes. I almost feel that the media “plays up” this discrimination. \n\tI do not really know what we could do to change this. I mean, how do you go about changing cultures norms and they ways things have been?\n\tGender discrimination does not seem to affect women as much as it used to, as we hear stories about the women in the corporate world, and husbands at home. The changing roles have become a topic of discussion in the 21st century- things are changing on their own. \n\t\n",
        "\tFirst off, I don’t feel that this issue was a matter of invasion of privacy, but more of an issue of noble cause.  The person who posted the bulletin obviously wanted someone to see it and probably wasn’t thinking of the consequences of doing so.  They posted the bulletin on a public server and allowed at least some of their friends to see this.  In doing so they threw out any claim they could possibly have that this was an invasion of privacy and deserve what they got not only for their cause but also for their lack of consideration of where they were putting this information.\n\tHowever, I do believe that there are many areas that the school officials should learn to draw the lines on the issue of privacy.  When it comes to issues of security like the one mentioned in the question, schools have every right to question the student involved.  The only complication in this could arise about their methods to find this information.  If it is written in a notebook in the student’s private bedroom and the school requires the parents to do a random search based on how the student behaves or dresses, then the issue of privacy comes into play.  If it is posted on an online server that can be accessed by many people, privacy is not an issue.\n\tI guess the line really needs to be drawn on when schools begin to assume the worst based off of minor things such as dress.  Different styles provoke different judgments of people.  There are trends such as “emo” and “gothic” that really include just a bunch of kids who share similar tastes in music, art, etc, and only dress that way to draw attention to them or make others see them as different.  It’s been my personal experience (from an event that happened several years ago), that the ones that are truly hiding some of these qualities can be the most normal looking people.  Searching people or questioning people for these reasons alone is an invasion of privacy and not much better than searching or questioning them because of the color of their skin.\n\tSchool officials need to learn to make it their business to find true signs that someone may be thinking about going on a rampage rather than rummaging through that students hobbies and favorite bands, violating them on the basis of their appearance and taste.  This will not only prevent intrusions on that student’s privacy, but also help to root out possible threats to the safety of other students.\n\tThe real issue of privacy comes down to when the school assumes that they know too much about a particular type of person and goes into their business for that reason alone.  Any threat that is posted somewhere that multiple people can read about it can and should be silenced.  Since the use of a public server was used to host the message, the student really has no claim that the school taking action is an invasion of privacy.\n",
        "\tI feel that, over the past 150 years in America, we have progressed leaps and bounds in the direction of gender equality.  At one time or another, America has disenfranchised women, forced them into strict gender roles, and adopted educational structures which disadvantage females.  Presently, none of these things overtly happen any more.\n\tWomen fought for the right to vote in America, and it worked (slowly but surely!).  In our schools, we still teach children about the “struggle for women’s suffrage in America”.  This struggle is a textbook example of the American political dream in action – a certain group expresses its collective voice contrary to societal convention, is not subjected to repression, and through rational/political actions, achieves its ends (freedom to democratically participate).  Women today may participate just as freely in the American political process as men, and are not countered by institutionalized sexism.\n\tThe extension of voting rights to women was a milestone, but by no means did it instantly give the sexes equal status.  Gender roles still encouraged women to stay at home.  Some women worked in factories (most notoriously, in textiles), but the wages/accommodations were meager.  During the Second World War, the need for male foot soldiers coupled with the need for manufactured industrial goods once again sent scores of women into factories.  After the war, however, the “nuclear family” image reinforced “traditional” gender roles, creating a generation of dissatisfied housewives.\n\tThe most loud spoken (and remembered) voice of the “oppressed” housewife generation was Betty Friedan.  Her book The Feminine Mystique empowered women in a fiery way never before seen, and its rhetoric ushered us into the modern era of American gender relations.\n\tRecently, there was talk in congress of a constitutional amendment that would equate men and women (the “Equal Rights Amendment”).  While this amendment didn’t pass, scores of case law regarding gender discrimination have made it clear that overt gender discrimination is illegal in America.\n\tWhile overt discrimination is considered “taboo”, I believe that covert, ingrained discrimination is evident when we view statistics such as the “gender wage gap”.  I don’t know the statistics off the top of my head, but I know that the mean salaries of American men and women are not equal.  There are innumerable women in America who are successful, and some corporate CEOs are female.  However, there is still a wage gap, and I believe the number of male CEOs in America is larger than the number of female CEOs in America.\n\tAll in all, I don’t believe that women are actively “discriminated” against in the work place.  Statistically, however, a large number of CEOs are still men.  These CEOs have much power/influence over the working environments within their companies.  Sexual harassment (not quite equal to discrimination) is certainly a workplace problem, and for every case which is brought to justice, I’d hypothesize that there are many more which aren’t properly dealt with.\n\tSo basically, in retrospect, I think I sort of circumvented the point of this prompt (contemporary, current gender discrimination) by rambling off most of what I know about the political history of American feminism.  Sorry about that.\n",
        "\tI can’t see any way at all in which school officials circumventing a dangerous situation by reading a student’s Myspace would be an invasion of privacy.  Any information posted on the internet is meant for others to read- otherwise, why put it up?  Information made public in any way, like in a note passed around or posted on a blog, should no longer have privacy rights attached to it.\n\tIf this were a case like the one in which a girl’s purse was subjected to search by school officials because she was suspected of possessing marijuana, it might be different.  A purse is by definition private property (someone owns it), the internet is not.  This is especially true because the entire purpose of Myspace is to share personal information with your friends and other users.  The information on your “personal site” is constantly subject to review and censorship by the creators of Myspace, which they tell you on registration, so there is no real expectation of privacy.  In fact, many schools warn their students that they search student Myspaces and Facebooks.\n\tEven a personal site not on a host like Myspace or Facebook can’t be considered private property unless it is specifically made unavailable to everyone except a certain group of people.  Anyone can get a Myspace, and anyone can look at most personal sites.  It is a school’s right to look at the same personal information that is available to millions of people all over the world with a click of a button - people such as stalkers and child molestors!  If a person has no problem with potentially dangerous people seeing such personal information, then he or she really has no call to pick and choose who has a right to look and who doesn’t.\n\tPosting a bulletin on Myspace that says you are going to shoot up your school is akin to writing it on the bathroom wall and signing it (you can’t post an anonymous bulletin).  You can’t guarantee which of your friends will use that bathroom and see it and you can’t guarantee that no teachers will wander in and read it as well.  I would have more of an expectation of privacy for my school locker than my Myspace, and schools constantly warn that lockers are subject to random checks, including with drug dogs, and if they have probable cause that you are breaking school rules your locker will be searched.  \n\tSchools have, or should have, the right to subject any material brought into the school to search or seizure if given probable cause.  Basically my view on it is if you don’t want your principal to see it, then don’t bring it to school.  The issue is a little cloudier with Myspace because the bulletin wasn’t brought in to the school, but was posted in a setting where many of the perpetrator’s classmates could see and read it.  It is the schools job to look out for the interests and safety of its students - there are cases where it is acceptable for schools to interfere in non-academic issues to protect students, like when one student gets a dangerous and contagious disease it is the school’s responsibility to notify other students that they may be infected as well.\n\tThe line is very unclear for the amount of power schools should have.  I would say that it should stop at interfering with home life and what students do outside of school, but schools have the right to call social services if they think a bad home life is affecting a student, and they have the right to suspend students who are found drinking.  The bottom line is that by sending their children to school for 6 hours a day parents are conferring a huge amount of responsibility on the school to keep their child safe, and that responsibility doesn’t just last during school hours.  The right of schools to invade privacy is often questioned in legitimate circumstances, but reading a public bulletin posted on the internet should not be one of them.\n",
        "Essay 3\nI have two thoughts on gay marriage. I do believe that everyone has every right to be with the one they love. However, because it is against church teachings, I do not understand why they are making such a big deal out of calling it marriage. Marriage is a sacrament between a man and a woman. It is an eternal bond that they share. You also have to look at it from the perspective of a catholic as well. If God loves everyone the same and treats us all equally, why wouldn’t he accept a gay couple? I think that He would accept them, but because the laws of marriage were meant solely for procreation in the time of Jesus, this is just another reason that the church must alter laws to keep up with the times. I know a gay man who has a significant other. They want desperately to be married. I asked them what they thought and he said “It’s not like if we get married, the whole world is going to become gay and there will be no more procreation.” I agree with this. Also, with the number of gay marriages increasing, maybe there will be an increase in the rate of adoption around the world which is a very good thing. Children could have two parents that love them and all the opportunities in the world. President Bush’s law against gay marriage is ridiculous. First off, I do not think this is any of the government’s business. Honestly, what do they care if gay people are getting married? They should be worried about other issues such as health care, education, poverty in the US and the war in Iraq. Gay marriage is an issue between the homosexuals of America and the Church that is in its very early stages. I believe the church has to alter some teaching, yes, but I think that, to compromise, marriage should stay between a man and a woman and gay marriage should be called something else since it obviously is not an eternal, sacred bond between a man and a woman. This is an issue that is going to be fought over for a very long time since it is fairly new of a topic. Homosexuals are just as much a part of the Unites States as we are and they deserve every right that we have. Which I believe they do. In regards to the church, I think there is a lot more sensitivity because homosexuality was not seen as a norm when the laws were being made. Hopefully, with time, like most other controversial issues, this will be resolved and maybe gay marriage will be seen as more of a normal thing. Personally, I am for their rights and I would like to see them be just as happy and get to experience married life and family life just like every other heterosexual couple. It is a very special experience and if you can find that person, whether it be a man or a woman, then I believe you should spend the rest of your life with them.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "\tLet me begin by saying that I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer.  There are hundreds of different drugs that we dispense daily, all of them having some medical purpose.  We have many drugs that are known as “controlled substances.”  These drugs must always be kept under lock and key because of their addictive properties.  We have several derivatives of opiates like morphine and dilaudid that are very similar in structure to heroin.  These drugs are legal, but they are controlled, and the system works very well.  We occasionally dispense THC in tablet form, the active ingredient in marijuana.\n\tThe point is this.  Marijuana, when used for medical purposes can be quite beneficial.  Just because it is an illegal drug, people think it has nothing but bad properties.  Marijuana should become legal for medical use because it can help people struggling with glaucoma or cancer.\n\tPast experience shows that highly addictive drugs can be used safely when they are labeled with the “controlled substance” tag.  However, I believe it would be a mistake to allow the public to freely use marijuana, as Denver has done somewhat.  People would abuse marijuana because they have been used to so many years of being told they can’t have it.  When you tell people they can’t have something, it is natural for them to want to get it.  It would be a very big risk to public safety.  People would be driving when they are high, because they would think that since marijuana is now legal, they can legally drive around with it in their bloodstream.  Accidents would increase, and more people would get hurt.\n\tOnce the taboo of marijuana has been done away with (this would take many years), then I would say that it can be safely legalized, in much the same way as alcohol is today.\n\tMarijuana’s effects are not so nasty that it turns people into zombies.  It is not addictive, and it is hard to overdose with it.  For these reasons, I believe that it should not be treated as harshly as other illegal drugs like cocaine and heroine.  It quite simply is not that bad.  But the government has chosen to come down hard on marijuana, probably because it was once widely used (and still is).  Because the government says marijuana is so bad, people naturally try to get their hands on it.  They in effect have shot themselves in the foot by prohibiting its usage completely and tricking people into thinking that its worse than it really is.\n\tMarijuana is a drug in its own category.  Cocaine and heroine could never be legalized for public usage, but I think marijuana, with time, could be.  With time is the key word.  First, I say make it available for medical use.  Then, with time, the taboo surrounding marijuana will dissipate, and people will be able to use it responsibly.  Also, it is worth noting that the prison systems are way too overfilled.  This is largely the result of teenagers getting caught with marijuana.  Legalizing marijuana could be a long term remedy for this problem.\n",
        "      The Catholic Church has received a lot of negative energy from many different people, mostly because these people think that the Church is too forward with its views and opinions and because they think the Church tries too hard to convert everyone into believing that the Church’s views and opinions are the only right ones.  What I believe as a Catholic is that the church is widely and grossly misunderstood not only by the American public, but most of the people around the world as well.  First of all, people have a right to believe in whatever religion or different type of credo that they want, regardless whether the government controlling wherever they live thinks they deserve this right or not.  Knowing this, every person should consider their options and take their time and energy deciding what they would like to identify themselves as, as to not falsely join a belief system that they don’t believe in.  After taking the time to decide, the person should be committed to their beliefs, and stand up for what they believe is right.  This is all I think the Catholic Church has done in the 21st century.  Therefore, I do not believe the Catholic Church is too archaic for a massive adaptation for the 21st Century to take place.  However, if at any point the situation changes and the Church does become too archaic, I would support appropriate change within the Church as long as they kept the same basic doctrines and beliefs.\n      As far as the publicized scandals concerning Catholic priests committing various acts of pedophilia, I am disgusted.  One must take into account that priests are still human, and that they are not perfect.  Still, these people have failed miserably at the tasks assigned to them, and the Church as well as the government should punish them to the maximum extent allowed for such a disgusting and unspeakable crime.  Every other person with any other ordinary job would be given the same punishment for these crimes, and priests do not deserve any special treatment just because they are affiliated with a religion.  If Catholic priests were allowed to marry, there might have been a chance that they would not have resorted to the aforementioned acts of pedophilia.  However, centuries upon centuries of priests have found it manageable to do their duty without molesting children, so there is no excuse for the current state of affairs.\n      The pedophilia scandal just represents another failure of the Catholic Church in large, and history has proven that the Catholic Church is not perfect by any means.  The most obvious and horrendous example would be the crusades, which caused an almost uncontested level of death and suffering.  Since the Church holds its ideals with such steadfastness, people hold them to high standards (as they should) and call them hypocrites at the first sign of wrongdoing.  However, I have a Catholic message to point of the flaw of the arguments of these people – let he without sin cast the first stone.\n",
        "      The war in Iraq is certainly a very controversial issue indeed.  Honestly, I am not even sure exactly how I feel about it.  I do not believe that I know enough about the current situation or about the whole history of the situation to truly make a decision.  I would like to be more knowledgeable about current events such as this, but I don’t watch the news or read newspapers enough.  One thing that I do feel about the war is that I would like it to end as soon as possible.  I would like our troops home and safe.  Too many innocent lives have been lost already.  I am, however, very supportive of our soldiers.  \n      I also feel that since the United States intervened in Iraq and basically eliminated whatever political structure existed in Iraq, it is up to us to finish what we started.  It would not be fair for us to go in, knock out whatever form of government existed (no matter how tyrannical or harsh it was) and then just leave the Iraqi people to clean up the mess that we made.  So while I would like for our troops to be able to come home soon, I do see the need for us to remain to keep peace while the new democratic government gets on its feet.  I just don’t want us to stay longer than is necessary.  This war has gone on long enough.  \n      As far as the start of the war goes, I am not sure if I feel that we should have gone there in the first place.  After the events of September 11th, I could definitely see the reasoning and the logic behind the war in Afghanistan:  our nation was terrorized and attacked and we wanted to find the people responsible for that.  It would have been very odd if we had not done something in response to the attack on September 11th.  However, the war in Iraq is not directly related to September 11th.  After the terrorist attacks, naturally our country was on the watch for anything that might pose a threat to our safety.  Security everywhere was heightened.  When news came out that Saddam Hussein might have weapons of mass destruction, obviously we were very concerned.  We did not just want to stand by and wait until these weapons could possibly be used against our country.  On the other hand, we wanted to exercise diplomatic ways of going about it first, before just starting a war.  But Iraq would not allow the United Nations officials to search the country for the weapons.  This made us even more nervous.  We didn’t want to wait.  We tried to get approval before just going in, but this led to the whole issue with France.  \n      This is where I am confused on whether or not it was the right decision to wage war on Iraq without the consent of the United Nations.  This is also where many anti-Bush people bring up the issue of oil, stating the Bush just wanted to get oil and that that was the primary motivation for going into Iraq.  What I can think of, is that if we had not gone into Iraq and it turned out that they did have weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein sold to terrorist organizations which then attacked us, we would be very sorry and would be wishing that we had done something as a preventative measure.  It just seems like a huge shame that so many lives have been lost along the way.  \n",
        "Privacy rights…That is a hot button issue all right.  In the information age, well, privacy is a hot commodity.  Whether that is on the Internet, in your home, in everyday normal life, privacy is hard to find.  Now that we have the Internet things are even worse.  People place everything on the Internet.  Pictures.  Stories.  Credit Card numbers.  Everything is out there for the world to see.  Most people don’t even enable security features; even more don’t know security features exist.  We have things like Facebook.com, and Myspace.com.  These were originally made as networking sites.  Myspace.com came first.  It allowed people to make profiles, send messages, and post bulletins.  You aren’t supposed to be able to have a Myspace.com account until you are fifteen, however, no one checks and so it easy for children to lie and retain an account.  What was originally a networking web site, has now become a free for all of teenagers and college students playing around on the Internet, showing off their mischief.   Let’s move on to Facebook.  Originally a networking site meant for college students.  You had to have a valid college email address to have a profile.  Rather recently it was opened to the public.  Students have pictures of them drinking underage, engaging in numerous illicit and illegal activities.   They don’t seem to realize that things on the Internet are open to everyone.  Once something is anywhere on the Internet it is public domain.  The Internet is a public domain.  You put it out there someone is going to see it.  Your RA, your principal, your teachers, or even your parents.  Don’t be shocked if you get a phone call about a picture, which was shown, to your parents of you “totally wasted”.  \nIn reference to the situation in the prompt, no, it’s not an invasion of privacy.  First of all, to see bulletin’s on Myspace.com you have to be that person’s MySpace “friend”.  It does not seem like the teachers were trolling the MySpace boards just trying to find problems.  It seems that this was brought to their attention by another student.  How can that be an invasion of privacy?  The job of the supervisors at the school was to protect the majority of the students, not only teach them.  They had to act even though this may have just been a joke by this student.  I think this example should show teens as well as children and adults that when you say something, especially on the Internet, it can come back to haunt you.  You could be joking, you could be serious, perhaps you just weren’t thinking but these things can come back to haunt you.  This is a big issue in colleges right now, due to Facebook.  Students post pictures of them at parties, or drinking with their friends.  They forget that their RA, and their dean , and their teachers ,and even their parents could easily have a facebook account and be viewing these pictures.  Some colleges are even using facebook pictures as “evidence” in the judicial process.  There’s a fine line, but people need to realize that once you put something on the internet, it’s no longer private. \n",
        "\tThe ever-advancing technology of the 21st century raises many questions about the issue of privacy.  Essential to any debate over privacy rights is the knowledge that most modern means of communication are not secure.  The World Wide Web and all its information is accessible to anyone.  Whatever is posted on websites like Myspace or Facebook is no longer private material.  Users are warned that even their emails and instant messages are accessible to others.  Teachers have the same right as anyone else to browse the web, and therefore looking at a student’s myspace page is not an invasion of privacy.  \n\tPeople who create web accounts with sites like myspace are informed of the accessibility of the site, and the publishers of the site require that its patrons acknowledge and accept this fact.  If students fail to take into account the possibility of parents or teachers seeing the information that they post, it the students’ own fault.  \n      One of a school’s top priorities is the safety of its students.  The faculty and administration must take care to observe and acknowledge any threats to that safety.  As a student, personal privacy is much less important than general safety.  This is why school officials have the right to search desks and lockers.  All suspicions, accusations, and threats must be thoroughly investigated.  Too much violence has taken place at schools in recent years.  School is supposed to be a safe haven for children, a place where they can feel free to grow and learn.  Students cannot feel this way if they live in fear.\n      Not only is safety a top priority, but personal development of the students is very important as well.  Obviously if children are exhibiting violent tendencies, there are some problems in their life and issues that need to be worked out, and may require the experienced help of teachers and counselors.  My mother works in an elementary school in my town.  She told me about an incident that involved several seventh graders and information posted on myspace.  These students had formed a hate group targeting another student in the class.  The principal found out about it, and the students responsible for creating the group were reprimanded, though I am not sure how.  The principle went even further than this and called a meeting of parents to preach against the dangers of website like myspace that encourage kids to post a great deal of personal information about themselves on an unsecured, easily accessed medium.  This is a necessary step to take I believe, because children need know that there are many people besides teachers who will see their myspace pages, and the consequences may be much more dangerous than detention.\n      School is not the only place where security takes priority over privacy.  The U.S. government has, many times throughout its history, limited citizens’ right to privacy in favor of national security.  There is however, a very important difference with this particular school situation: by posting that bulletin on myspace, the student had no right to privacy to begin with.\n\t\n",
        "\tThe War in Iraq is a really tough subject to come to a conclusion on.  I do believe that this is an unjust and unnecessary war, but sadly the decision was made to deploy troops and now we are stuck there until the job is complete.  We have torn apart their government (hopefully for the better) but in the whole run, we have also torn apart their society.  Civil war has only begun in Iraq and we will probably see it continue and possibly overthrow any type of order that we may put in place there.\n\tWith this said, I guess it can be determined that I feel that the war has gone on long enough, and I would love to have all of the troops pulled out safely.  However, if this were done we’d be creating more problems than we’ve solved (if that hasn’t been done already).  Any type of government currently in place would easily be torn down at a much higher pace than it was created.  For this reason we must keep our troops in there to maintain stability.  If we were to withdraw at this point in time there would also be many more civilian casualties due to national feuds that exist in Iraq.\n\tOne thing that I highly do not agree with is the United States government sending more and more troops overseas to help fight.  There have been relatively few casualties on our own side, deploying more troops just seems like an attempt to “show our power.”  However, all that it is doing is putting more lives in danger than are needed.  This operation can be accomplished, or come closer to being accomplished with the current amount of troops that we have deployed.  Setting up a government should not be force based (the approach that George W. Bush has gone at it), but more of a deliberated issue so that both sides can remain somewhat satisfied in the end.\n\tI guess with all of this said, if I had to choose one way or the other, I would choose for the war to end and deliberation to begin.  This way we could work with the Iraqi citizens to form a government that would not show support or opposition to one side or the other (Shiite or Sunni).  This government would need to be a neutral central power that could resolve the issues between both sides through words rather than violence.  The United States government is looking at this through the wrong eyes.  They are assuming that unless we use guns and bombs, nothing will ever be solved.  They are seeing the citizens of Iraq as dogs that need to be tamed rather than people who have free thinking minds that can help decide on issues themselves.  I’m sure that if given a choice, over 90 percent of the citizens there would choose peaceful deliberation over violence.  However, because our government does not see it that way, the war continues and more troops are continuously deployed.\n",
        "\tI believe that the Catholic Church does need to change its ways. With many issues, the Church is bound in the ways of the bible. The bible, being written many years ago does not take into account new ways of thinking. \n      Priests have many rules they need to obey. They are not allowed to be married; they are seen as being married to the Church. In many other religions the holy men are allowed to be married and still serve their faith. I don’t think there would be much of a change if priests were allowed to have a wife. Their devotion to their faith would not be changed. Having a family and a wife does not mean you cannot still serve in your job. Look at all other professions; all the men and women who hold jobs are still able to have a family if they want to. The church should be no different. A family does not change a devotion to faith.\n      Having female priests would also be a positive change for the church. Since the founding of the Catholic Church, priests have been required to be male. But what is the difference? Why is a man a better fit for a holy man? I don’t understand what the difference would be; a female could hold the same devotion as a male. \n      Now we need to take into account the recent acts of pedophilia involving priests in the Catholic Church. I do not believe that this act would have been change if priests were allowed to be married. These terrible acts happen even now all over the country. Not always with priests, but with other men who think this is a good idea. Allowing priests to marry would not have changed how they acted. They acted inappropriately and should be punished.\n      The Catholic Church holds many strong views on issues that are currently being discussed in our world. On the issue of sex, the Church believes in abstinence until marriage, and do not condone any other form of birth control. Although this is the view that most would hope is being followed, this is not the case. Many people who have yet to be married are having sexual relations. Isn’t it more important to help the health and well being of the people involved? Now that our society has altered views on this issue, isn’t it time for our church to follow?\n      The same goes with the topic of gay marriage and gay rights in general. The Catholic Church holds strong disapproval of gay marriage. This has become an immense issue in our society which is involving government in making the final decision, but the Church should look into learning more about the issue to try and accept it. The Church should be a place where you can come to feel one with god, no matter what your sexual preference is.\n      The Catholic Church has to make some changes to catch up to the 21st century. Many strides have been made in other branches of life in the United States but the church is one place that has never changed.\n",
        "      Regardless of my personal feelings about war in general, I am hard-pressed to find any legitimate political reason for the invasion of Iraq.  Feeding on escalated feelings of anti-terrorism in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, President Bush convinced the country that Saddam Hussein was an immediate threat in possession of weapons of mass destruction who needed to be removed from power.  In a most anti-constitutional fashion, Congress granted the President power to deploy troops and attack Iraq without making a formal declaration of war. (According to the Constitution, only Congress has the power to declare war, at the President’s request)  The faulty planning and the poor strategy that followed created devastating effects.  The number of dead American soldiers and dead Iraqis is still rising three years later.  But after having been there for so long, after turning their world upside down, how can the United States abandon the Iraqi citizens now? \n      Bush had a special word for his invasion of Iraq; he called it a pre-emptive strike – attack them before they have the chance to attack us.  His administration claimed to have evidence that proved Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.  Based on this rationale, why hasn’t the U.S. invaded North Korea?  This is a country whose government openly advertises its possession of nuclear capabilities.  Yet North Korea remains untouched.  After taking over Iraq, no weapons of mass destruction were actually found.  And so questions arise, questions about the real motives behind the war effort.  Some speculate that it was a personal vendetta, passed on from father to son.  It was indeed President Herbert Walker Bush who launched the first attack against Saddam Hussein in the 1st Gulf War.  Others say the reason had to do with money, and greed of the United States in its desire to control the rich oil region.  \n      U.S. troops easily overthrew the Iraqi government and scared Saddam into hiding.  In the absence of government, a power vacuum formed, a vacuum for which Bush did not have a plan to effectively control.  Looting and vandalism plagued the streets of Iraqi towns and villages.  There was no law and no law enforcement to hold the people in check.  It took time for the U.S. government to implement a democratic form of government there.  If anyone knows the amount of time, struggle, and dedication it takes to establish a steady, functioning democratic government, it should be the United States, the first modern democratic nation.  Nearly 100 years after its inception, the country divided itself in a bloody civil war.  How could the U.S. government, backed originally by a majority of the U.S. people, imagine that a change of such magnitude would happen in Iraq in one decisive stroke?  \n      The U.S. government sent neither substantial troops nor substantial equipment.  The American forces in Iraq were left insufficiently prepared to deal with the military insurgents that still linger today.  Thousands upon thousands of American soldiers have died, many from unpreventable car bombs and individual suicide bombers.  Part of the solution to this problem is to train local police forces, something the American troops are doing now.  But this takes time and money, more time and money than the government originally planned on expending.\n      The U.S. government, no matter how wrong it was in starting this war, now has a responsibility to the Iraqi people to finish it.  The U.S. has a responsibility to leave Iraq in a state of peace and security.  This is only right since peace and security is what the U.S. government took away.\n      \n\n",
        "\tWhat exactly is marriage?  Is it harmonious monogamy proscribed by God?  Is it a collection of tax and financial benefits?  Who can define it?  Is it up to the federal government, or is it up to state legislatures?  Is it up to municipal clerks and judges?  Does the full faith and credit clause of the constitution apply when “activist judges” alter marriage’s basic definition?  Does it always have to be amongst a man and a woman?\n\tThese questions, and more, are among the hangnails which plague today’s gay marriage debate, and slowly distract our political system from addressing objectives which are much more important.  Many “religious righters” see homosexual marriage as a harbinger of the apocalypse, and carry on a “moral crusade” (more like a “moral charade”) against it.  To them, the definition of marriage (as between a man and a woman) shant be changed, for if it changes, society will fall apart at the seams!\n\tMany of them extend the effects of gay marriage, rhetorically, to entirely new realms of being.  “Well, if men can marry men, and women can marry women, then how long is it before people start marrying horses?  Sheep?  Inanimate objects?  Washing machines?”.\n\tThere isn’t really much merit to these questions.  The one respectable assertion which “homo haters” have left is that of their personal values.  To many, the idea of homosexual marriage is deeply offensive, and shocks the moral conscience.  To many, it contradicts their dear religious values to the very core.  This is perfectly acceptable, and for this reason, I do not think that “gay marriage” is a good idea.  We can’t allow homosexual couples to join in a relationship called “marriage”, for if we do, these people will go beserk.\n\tIndeed, homosexual “marriage” is unacceptable.  However, nobody is asking the government to force church doors open.  Nobody is asking for legislation which would require specific faiths to recognize gay marriages.  This would be a catastrophic collision of church and state.\n\tRather, we should extend the state-offered benefits of “marriage” to homosexual couples.  They don’t have to actually stand on a catholic alter before a catholic priest, but, they should be able to do some sort of paperwork which secures them the legal advantages afforded to married couples.  Lets call it something else besides marriage – civil union, enjoining, magic pony ceremony, whatever, it really doesn’t matter what we call it, as long as it isn’t marriage.\n\tBy removing marriage from the religious realm and highlighting solely its legal advantages, we remove the religious argument from the sphere of relevancy.  After all, things like hospital visiting rights, spousal tax benefits, and mortgage co-signing were NOT proscribed by god, do not appear in the bible, and thus, don’t need to be safeguarded by the religious right.\n\tWe should allow homosexual couples to enjoy these benefits without affording the religious right the luxury of having something to whine about.  I can’t see any reason why this isn’t a good objective.  I think I’m pretty close to 500 words now.\n",
        "\tRecent media around the United States has boosted the topic of gay “marriages” to the point where you see it everywhere. I am not a supporter or a hater of gay men or women, but I do have a problem with people acknowledging a wedlock between two of the same sex. I can see where people come from on both sides of the debate. It is obvious how people can be offended by it, but I can also see how people can not help themselves if they are gay or straight- it was apparently the way that they were born. I believe that gays should be able to become a couple legally, but not through the word “marriage.”\n\n\t“Marriage,” according to www.dictionary.com, is “the social institution under which a man and woman establish their decision to live as husband and wife by legal commitments, religious ceremonies, etc.” This definition of the word allows no room for arguments. This mentions both legal and religious issues- two issues that people argue about when the subject is brought up. Nowhere in this description mentions a man and a man, or a woman and another woman being together. Since the definition of the word “marriage” is described as this, I believe that another word, such as “partnership,” etc., should be used in place of “marriage.” I have witnessed the conversation between a gay and straight person where the straight male asked the gay male how he knew if he was gay or not. The response of the gay man was asking the opposing straight man how he knew if he was straight or not. The gay man’s argument was that he could not help it, and that it was as natural as being straight.\n\n\tEven though one of these men was straight and the other gay, they are both United States Citizens and live under the U.S. Constitution. What this means is that every person has the same guaranteed rights to live their lives by. What people need to realize is that our country was based upon Christian principles. I can not see how changing these founding principles can be a good thing. The best option is to work around, not change, these words written so long ago. As said earlier, a bind between a two men or women could be called a “partnership.” If this wording existed, then a marriage could still be a sacred unity between a man and a woman in Christianity. This would both respect our country’s founding religion and please the rapidly changing modern views of U.S. citizens.\n\n\tSince George W. Bush is the leader of this Christian-based country, he needs to realize the fact that he needs to live up to the wants of our nation. While pleasing our citizens, President Bush should also be keeping in touch with the basis of our country. A simple change of words is the solution to all of these problems. There is no fighting the fact that the United States government was founded on Christian beliefs- beliefs that a marriage consists of a man and a woman. If you change a religion so that it suits your personal interests, then you are not committed enough to your religion. Allowing “gay marriages” would precisely be doing this- changing the religion to suit modern wants, not needs. Even though this one word is a small step, the change of it will be powerful enough to stop all of the problems it is creating in the United States. \n",
        "\tGender discrimination is more commonly associated with the past, when peoples roles in life were defined by their gender.  Nowadays, it easier for women to hold professional positions, and there are men who run their households.  That is not to say, however, that the problem of gender discrimination has been eliminated.  While it is possible for people today to break through the boundaries imposed by gender discrimination, those boundaries still exist in a very real way.   Stereotypical gender roles are still prevalent, and women are often discriminated against in the workplace and in traditionally male settings.  There is also a less significant issue of men being discriminated against in traditionally female roles.  Overall, a lot of gender discrimination still exists in the present-day United States, to which there is no simple solution.\n\tSolving the problem of gender discrimination is no easy task.  It will of course take much to time to completely even out the expectations for males and females, and it may not even be achievable given the United States’ past history of unequal gender roles.  The best thing to do is to encourage men and women who take on positions and tasks typically designated for the opposite sex.  Only with widespread acceptance of such actions will they become the norm, which is necessary to eliminate gender discrimination.  It is important to try to separate a role from a gender, so that it becomes accepted for any role to be played by any individual regardless of gender, which is what it means to be free of gender discrimination.  There is a long way to go to solve the problem of gender discrimination, but hopefully the conscious efforts that people make to accept untraditional roles will contribute to the elimination of such a negative force that shapes society.\n",
        "Unfortunately, gender discrimination is still a problem in our society today. Although it is much more subtle than it ever was it still does exist. I believe that gender discrimination is most prominent in the business world. Our society is trained to automatically think that the owner of a business or company is a man and all of his top managers and CEO’s are men as well. I think that we get this image from things such as television, movies, and sadly, real life. Most children grow up their fathers out working. It is rare that the father is the stay-at-home parent and the mother is out working. I also think that there is discrimination based on what want you choose to be your occupation. You rarely see a male preschool teacher, nurse, secretary, day care owner, or stay-at-home parent. I have personal experience concerning this issue. While my brother, my sister, and myself were growing up, my mom was always at school functions, always home to answer the phone, and always available to pick us up from school and friends houses. All of our friends’ mothers thought that was mom was a stay at home mom and so did their dads. So, when all of our families would all get together during the year, the fathers were automatically gravitate toward each other and talk business. Little did they know that my mother was the owner of the Universal Advertising Agency. She had began the business when we were all very young and she ran it from our house so that she could easily double as a stay-at-home parent! All of my friends fathers was amazed at how much she knew about the business world. Another example is my friends father. Most of my other friends’ mothers were lunch “ladies” at my old high school. Well, one father decided that he was going to become a lunch “man” because he worked nights and he had the whole day free. Although it was sort of weird at first, we ended up loving it because he would be the best cook there! He also gave out some free stuff here an there. What I am trying to say is that either sex has the potential to do anything they want whether that occupation is dominated by males or females. To help the problem of gender discrimination across our nation, I think that we just have to keep doing what we are doing already. We have to be open-minded, accepting, and not so ignorant to assume anything. I think we also have to expose the younger generations to different things. Learning tools such as flashcards with women nurses on one and a male doctor on the other does not help this cause. Young children are learning to decipher these two occupations by which sex dominates it. They are growing up thinking that females can’t be doctors and that men can’t be nurses. It is little things like this that is hindering our young generations.  \n\n\n\n\n",
        "Of course the war in Iraq has caused controversy.  All war causes controversy.  Most people have been connecting 9/11 to the Iraq war, and that’s just plain not true.  The government itself has even said there is no connection to 9/11.  Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction.  There were no mobile labs.  There was no anthrax.  That being said, I disagree with the reasons we supposedly went into Iraq.  Perhaps it was for oil, perhaps it was depose a dictator, but frankly, America is not the protector of the world.  It is not our job to take care of everyone.  Saddam Hussein may have been a horrible tyrant, but it is not our job to change that.  The big question is, what do we do now?  We have gone in, whether the reasons are valid or not, we are there.  So, what next?  We can’t just leave; we’ve left them with no recognizable system of government.  We took theirs away and have left it in shambles.  The “government” that’s in place is a puppet it’s not real.  How can we leave them now?  If we pull all of the troops out of Iraq in one fell swoop the society would collapse.  The bigger question is whether they even want a democratic government.  Perhaps, a democracy like we have here in the United States would not work in Iraq.  The society has been around much longer and is much more set in its traditions.  Who are we to decide that they should be democratic?  We can’t choose what’s right for their country any more than we can force the rest of the world to give up their prejudices.  I think the war itself has gone on far enough.  Why is the US building permanent military bases in Iraq?  It quite seems as though we are there to stay, which is not why we went in there in the first place.  \nBesides which, we keep sending more and more troops in, but not many are coming home.  We do not need so many troops there.  Unless we are trying to create the American colony of Iraq, bring some of them home! \nAlso, no one thinks about the fact that maybe, just maybe some of them just plain are not happy that we stuck our noses into their countries business.  Who gave us that right?  We are not the big brothers for the world.  It cannot be our job to be the police force and the protector for the planet.  We do not have the right to take over, and force our views on others.  Not everyone in the world should necessarily be a democrat.  It will not work in some cultures, they are just too different.   I think this war was started on false pretenses and needs to end.  However I do not know how that can be done, I am not a government strategist, we need to rely on them to pull us out gradually without allowing the government in Iraq to collapse.  \n",
        "\tPreventing a school shooting by accessing information from a MySpace bulletin is not an invasion of privacy by any means.  MySpace, along with Yahoo Personals, Facebook, and many other groups, are all public forum-like environments where information is passed amongst hundreds of thousands of internet users.  If someone posts any information on that type of website, he or she is allowing the world to view whatever information that might be.  Therefore, it makes no sense to treat such usage of that information as an invasion of privacy.\n\tIt is difficult to determine where school officials should draw the line as to whether or not they are invading the privacy of their students.  They must determine exactly what type of information is public and which is private.  Any information that is posted in a public environment, such as MySpace, is a legitimate source of information, especially if it means preventing a school shooting.  To deny the use of this information would be like denying a person the right to look up someone’s phone number in the Yellow Pages.  Any person listed in the Yellow Pages has their right to privacy, but they chose to leave their phone information public.  On the other hand, school officials should not delve into the private lives of any students, whether it is through a personal diary, cell phone text message, or crumpled up letter.  Usage of this type of information is morally wrong and a definite invasion of privacy.  \n",
        "      I think that is it good that school officials were able to prevent a school shooting, regardless of how they came about this information.  Which issue is more important:  the death of a student, or the fact that a student’s privacy might have been violated?  In my opinion, there is a clear cut answer:  the student’s life is much more important.  Frankly, I don’t even really see this as an invasion of privacy, since the information was posted on the Internet.  The information on the Internet is available for millions of people to see and when you post anything online, you need to be aware of this fact.\n\tEven though I am glad that the school official saw the bulletin on myspace since it saved a student’s life, we can still ask the question of whether or not this was an invasion of privacy.  To do so, we must know how the school official came across the information.  While I do not have a myspace profile myself, I know that myspace has certain privacy controls.  One of the settings is that you must grant someone permission to see your profile.  If this student had this setting on, then in order for the school official to have read the posting, the student must have granted the school official access to his or her profile.  If this was the case, then it was not an invasion of privacy, since the student gave permission.  If the student did not have this setting on, then he or she must be aware that anyone who has access to the Internet also potentially has access to view the information that is posted in his or her myspace profile.  If this was the case, then I still do not see this as an invasion of privacy, since the student posted information that is visible to everyone.  When ever you post any information on the Internet, you must realize that virtually anyone has access to this information.  Thus, it is up to you to monitor what you post.  If there is something that you do not want everyone to see, then you must be responsible and sensor what you post.  Think twice before putting anything on the Internet, because you never know who will be reading it.\n\tNow, all of that said, I will admit that it is a little weird and we must question why the school official was looking at the student’s myspace profile.  (I am happy that he or she was looking at it since it prevented possible loss of lives, but I will admit that it is kind of strange.)  Was the school official just randomly on the Internet and just happened to see this bulletin?  I highly doubt it.  What is more likely is that this student was suspected of being up to something or was profiled as a troubled kid.  The school official was most likely intentionally looking at this student’s profile in an effort to come up with more information.  It is hard to say where to draw the line here.  On the one hand, you might say that a school official should not be sitting around snooping through students’ myspace profiles.  But I still can’t get over the fact that had this school official not done this, innocent lives might have been lost. And to me, it is more important that lives are saved, than that we protect the privacy of teenagers.  \n",
        "\tIn the recent cited event where police officers were able to stop a school shooting because of information on myspace I believe they were correct in their actions.  First and foremost, the law enforcers of this country have a duty to protect all citizens and uphold the law.  With that in mind, I feel their actions were motivated by this cause and none other.  They did have to cross so-called “privacy boundaries” to do this, however, the issue of privacy in this case is irrelevant.  \n\tAny of the major facilitators (Facebook, myspace, etc…) of personal information on the World Wide Web these days make the information fairly public to a large number of people; the users merely need, at most, a password and username.  Sometimes those two pieces of information are not even required, as in the case of myspace.  So if there is no restriction or attempt to protect the community of users with some sort of agreement or set of log-in standards, it is unreasonable to call the information on the myspace wall private.  If the information is that easy to obtain, there are not any privacy attributions associated with it.  \n\tIn a moral debate about what is more important to society, privacy or human life, it is still hard to uphold the fact that privacy comes first and should be respected.  When it boils down to the fundamental nature of human society, life is invaluable and should be preserved at all costs.  The fact that people would revolt against law enforcement’s “improper” use of information when it saved potentially many innocent lives is nothing less than appalling.\n\tHad the specific situation described, or any other situation for that matter, gone through and progressed according to plan the general consensus would probably be to support the use of private information.  I think without the reality of information’s effect on other people, one would tend to favor a more theoretical argument, such as privacy rights in this situation.  If school shootings were to occur, however, the general reasoning would probably change to consent to usage of private information in the case where human harm can be prevented.  \n\tThe idea of privacy rights in the case of myspace pertains to information that is available to the general population on the World Wide Web.  With such easy and unhindered access to the information, it is hard to maintain a case for privacy rights when the sole purpose is to share your information with others.  Again, it is especially hard to maintain the case for privacy rights when that information contains threats to human safety.  The real issues that may stem from the idea of privacy rights on the World Wide Web are rights in other aspects of life:  phone conversations, personal credit information, and personal physical property among many others.\n\tIn my mind privacy rights become a much larger issue, especially recently where the government has been acting controversially to inspect possible homeland security issues, when the information is not generally available to the public or is not meant to be generally available to the public.  When phones are being tapped or personal correspondences are being intercepted where communication is meant to exist privately between small groups of people, privacy rights are being broken in my opinion.  \n\n",
        "\tI honestly don’t know that much about the Iraq War.  I’m not aware of many of the reasons people give in support or against it, so all I can say is what I think without having many of the facts.\n\tI feel that war was basically a bad idea to begin with.  Diplomacy would have been a much less damaging way to go, and would have led to greater results in the long run.  We went in with barely any support and basically politically bullied other countries into giving up their own resources for our use in a war we started all on our own.  It should have been an issue contained within the United Nations from the beginning.  Granted, the UN should have more power in deciding conflicts and authority over member countries.  Perhaps its relative ineffectiveness is part of the reason today we are still involved in a conflict that could have been avoided years ago.\n\tI honestly think the war in Iraq has done nothing  but make things worse.  The argument has been made that Saddam Hussein’s regime was an evil that America was right to rid the world of, and his image has been likened to that of Hitler.  But in the case of World War II, cries went out from the persecuted groups in Germany that were heard around the world.  The people wanted to be helped, and realized that nothing would ever change without major outside intervention.  Plus, Hitler posed an immediate threat to America because Germany and other members of the Axis were poised to take over the world if ever the Allied forces let down their defenses for a minute.  Saddam Hussein was in no way trying to take over America, or even European countries.  All of the “weapons of mass destruction” which posed such an immediate threat to us in 2001 have yet to be discovered, while if they had ever occurred in such quantities as they were thought to you’d think we would at least find a clue as to what happened to them.\n\tEven President Bush has changed his opinion, or at least his administration has.  “Stay the course”, encouraging citizens to keep supporting the war and discouraging a reevaluation of its execution and purpose, has changed to endorsement of a change in methods as Bush’s approval ratings magically drop.  I think a drastic change needs to made in America’s action in this war, or we are going to be in it for just as long as Vietnam if not longer, with even less results.  It’s not even clear what we’re trying to accomplish anymore.  Are we trying to rebuild Iraq, or just instill democracy, or still rid it of insurgent factions, or keep it under military control so it’s no longer a threat.  There are many mixed messages running through that war, and I’m not sure how Bush is even justifying keeping troops there so long after the war has officially been declared over.  The war in Iraq is still as much a war as the war in Korea was, although its motives are much less clear.\n\tAlthough since we went in to begin with, we have changed so much and had such an effect on the lives of Iraqi citizens that we have a responsibility not to just pull out and go back to America, and pretend like we were never there.  What we should be doing is not trying to patch up the situation by ourselves however, but admitting humility and asking for help.  Instead of donating money, time and supplies to giving Iraq new buildings and a new government, we should open up a little bit diplomatically to see what the Iraqi citizens actually expect and want from us, and what the UN thinks we should do.  The WAR, at any rate, has to end before any real improvement can begin.  If we can’t reach a compromise with Iraq that allows us to help them without them attacking us, then a neutral party needs to step in and take over relations because the way we’re going is leading us nowhere.\n",
        "My big question would be: for what? Why did Denver decide to do this? I mean is it for medical reasons or are they going to be selling “dime bags” at the pharmacy? If marijuana is used for medical reasons to alleviate pain for example during a cancer patient’s chemotherapy then I would say yes this is a good thing. But if they were legalizing marijuana as a way to stop children from buying them then I would say that the state didn’t work hard enough to help children choose a different route. Legalizing marijuana would stop children from buying it as much because I would be tapping into the fact that people want what they can’t have. \n\nMarijuana should be legalized if it were used to help people that were in pain. But that’s the only way I feel it necessary to legalize it. If they were to legalize as a way to decrease the demand then that may lead to legalizing other drugs like cocaine or ecstasy to decrease demand. Either way you look at it marijuana is still a drug so it’s not right to legalize it. But what about alcohol isn’t alcohol a drug? Or can’t it lead to it being a drug? Why don’t we make alcohol illegal then? I digress, but my point is that we should only legalize marijuana if truly necessary. \n\nMarijuana’s effects are not similar enough to alcohol so as to legalize it. Well actually from what I have seen marijuana is actually a lot to legalize than alcohol because people who are “high” usually just sit and don’t do much. Unlike alcohol where a lot of people usually get really reckless, they are the ones who get in car accidents and say things they didn’t mean all for a good time. You really don’t hear of many people smoking weed to get more social able it’s usually to get relax. \n\nAs I continually think about this I have come to the conclusion that they should only legalize marijuana if it will help sick people. Other than that they have no logical reason to legalize marijuana. Marijuana takes away from the lives of young kids who are swooped up into the gang life and killed all for some weed. Its not worth it and especially not worth the lives of innocent people who die from drive by shootings. Marijuana although it isn’t dangerous physically it is dangerous to the people that use it and even to the people that don’t. \n",
        "      During the summers of 2005 and 2006, I worked for a real estate company named Re/Max American Dream. A description of my job consisted of  answering telephone calls and setting up appointments for real estate agents to show homes on the market. Another title for this “Desk Management” job, as I liked to call it, would be a secretary. With the world as it is today, being an eighteen year old male who has a job as a secretary is not something to brag about. My reasoning for not wanting to admit to being a “secretary” is solely because of how society today looks upon the stereotypical job and description of a secretary. The public does not see a typical secretary as a hegemonic alpha male, but instead as a woman- the exact opposite of me. Since stereotypes have embedded themselves deeply into today’s society, I believe that gender discriminations are a huge portion of the present day United States.\n\n\tA typical stereotype for a woman consists of cooking, cleaning, and being weak whereas a male’s stereotype would be “macho,” loving sports, etc. These stereotypes are tied into the workforce, and sometimes determine whether a man or woman receives a job or not. The three types of jobs in the world today are stereotypical male jobs, stereotypical female jobs, and jobs for both sexes. An example of each may be a bouncer, a maid, and a pharmacist. If a random person was asked to pick which of these jobs were typically assigned to males, females, or both, the person would most likely get all of their decisions correct. Some jobs such as in construction require strength, and since males are naturally stronger, the majority of construction workers are men. When picturing a stereotypical maid, one could possibly think of the “French maid outfit.” There is no version of this outfit for men, because the job used to specifically be for women. Nothing is stopping a male or female from doing a job typically assigned to the opposite sex, but the reason that many people do not partake in this switch is because of the ways they were brought up. The entire world sees the jobs on television done by stereotypical people. Not only television, but media and other parts of society influence our take on gender and how we perceive it.\n\n      There have been little girls who like Thomas the Train, or little boys who “want to be a mommy” when they grow up. Gender definition doesn’t set into children’s minds until about the age of 5. It is at this point where they realize that stores do not sell clothing for everything they like, or toys that they want to play with specifically for their interests. It is at this age where boys start to play with G.I. Joes, and girls start to play with Barbie dolls, etc. Since before the United States existed, gender has always had its specific definitions for males and females. Everyone is brought up this way, and have been in past years. For this reason, mothers and fathers pass their views onto their children and so on. These children become heads of companies which then produce these stereotypical male or female toys based upon their views of gender. These toys further influence America’s view on gender to make the idea more steadfast as time goes on. The way to get rid of gender discrimination is to bring children up without gender-specific toys as mentioned above. Children would then play with whatever they want, and become and act how they were meant to act- without being influenced by society. Society has created America’s views on gender, and will not stop unless the next generation is brought up neutrally.\n29\n\n",
        "      The right to marry whoever one pleases is no more outrageous than freedom of speech, or the right to a fair trial, which are granted freely in the Bill of Rights.  Since the right to marry whoever one pleases is not explicitly stated as an American’s right, many people try to deny its existence.  In many cases, there is no controversy surrounding who a person chooses to marry.  When a woman chooses a man to spend her life with, she will meet no opposition from the government or political activists.  The same is true for a man who chooses a woman to marry.  When a woman chooses woman, however, or a man a man, the controversy surrounding the issue of marriage becomes much more pronounced.  All of a sudden, the union of two people which we call marriage is not as easily accepted by society.  Only in cases of homosexual marriages does the government wish to have a say in who can marry who.  This is not a proper place for the government to be in control, because it only becomes involved when it deems a marriage problematic, that is, when it is between two people of the same sex.\n\tNot only should the government step down from the issue of gay marriage, but the American people need to learn to be more tolerant of others.  Two of the main problems that people have with gay marriage are that they think it is contrary to the Bible, or it seems something they themselves would never want to participate in.  For those who oppose gay marriage because the Bible describes marriage in a traditional male-female sense, they need to remember that the Bible is to be interpreted, not read as law.  It is impossible to follow every facet of Biblical teaching, and as long as a gay marriage follows the rules of respect and exchange detailed in the Bible, then it is not contrary to Biblical teachings, just a different scriptural interpretation.  For those who oppose gay marriage because they themselves have no interest in ever being married to a person of the same sex, they need to learn that what is right for one person may be wrong for another.  Everybody is different and it is important to embrace these differences instead of forcing conformity to a set of rules that does not work for everyone.  Flexibility is the best way to please all.\n\tChoosing who to spend the rest of one’s life with is a big commitment, and anyone who decides to join themselves in the union of marriage to another human being should be allowed to do so legally by marriage.  People should be more tolerant and accepting of others, and realize that gay marriage is not hurting anyone, but only making people happy by giving them the opportunity to spend their lives with the people they love, united as one through the ritual of marriage.  There is really no reason to be opposed to people’s happiness, and therefore, no reason to be opposed to gay marriage, as for many people, happiness can be found through the possibility of gay marriage.\n",
        "\tI think the Catholic Church came a long way during the papacy of Pope John Paul II in terms of modernizing and reaching out to people of the world today, but still has many changes to make to fully adapt to life in the 21st century.  It’s very hard to balance the value of traditions such as not allowing birth control with modern values today and will by no means be an easy or quick process, although that is what people are calling for.  The problem is that such an evolution of society and technology has taken place over the past hundred or so years that an institution like the Church that has undergone a minimal amount of change since its inception 2000 is an anachronism.  It will take patience on the part of everyone involved to bring the Catholic Church to a resolution with the standards of modern people.\n\tThere are many aspects of Church doctrine that should be updated, like not allowing women priests or priests to be married.  In a society where women and men have achieved equal roles, or are trying to, it is important that an institution advocating equal rights should put into practice what it preaches.  There is no reason except tradition that women should not be priests, not to say that traditions are useless.  There are plenty of good traditions the can remind us of our heritage or unite people as a family or even a country, like the Fourth of July.  But when traditions are followed blindly for centuries without question, they can turn into harmful biases and inhibit change and growth.  There are many traditions the Catholic Church should hold on to, but the Latin Mass wasn’t one of them and celibate priests aren’t either.\n\tThere is much to be said for keeping strongly to convictions in the face of opposition, and the Catholic Church has been good at that from the moment of its birth.  But there is also much to be said for reviewing one’s convictions in light of the situation.  In the Bible, God told Moses that lepers were ritually unclean, but Jesus, in a much later place and time, declared that lepers were God’s children as much as any of us and were to be treated like so.  Vatican II proves that we don’t have to wait for Christ’s second coming to see changes happen in the Church.  Many aspects of Church tradition were changed then and Catholicism didn’t fall apart.  It may have lost some members who were upset by a change, but it gained many more who found the new, more modern Church more accessible to them.  There are going to be positive and negative consequences to a change in any organization as far-reaching and ancient as the Catholic Church, but long term benefits must be considered as well as the immediate emotional responses that are sure to happen among members.\n\tAs to the recent bout of pedophilia accusations dealing with Catholic priests, I believe that to be a separate issue from modernization in the Church.  Pedophilia is a serious mental illness, and there are both genetic and environmental aspects to the expression of any mental illness.  Perhaps there is such a relatively high rate of pedophilia among priests because many men who felt unnatural attraction to children became priests in hopes that the constant exposure to religion and vows of celibacy would keep their urges in check.  In any case, they were all well aware that no female priests were allowed and they would never be getting married.  If once they were priests they were overwhelmed with the responsibility or felt the call to marriage, they could have left the priesthood.  Although this isn’t easy and s heavily disapproved of, it’s not as if you’re going to jail or the Catholic Church will take out a bounty on your head if you leave the priesthood.  I think there are a lot of things the Church could do to modernize itself and make itself more in tune to its members, but it can’t influence whether or not priests are pedophiles.  Who knows how long this problem has existed - just because in the past few years it has been exposed doesn’t mean it’s new at all.  The Church should remove priests with pedophilia from power positions and get them the help they need, but it should concentrate on reaching out to the modern world.\n",
        "\tThe Catholic Church should adapt to life in the 21st Century with some very important and worthwhile changes.  While it is hard to make changes to traditions that seem as permanent as Catholicism itself, there would be many advantages to adopting certain new practices.  For example, with regards to pedophilia amongst priests, if the Catholic Church allowed priests to marry, this would greatly lessen the amount of pedophilic incidents.  Also, since the Church is experiencing a continuous shortage of priests, allowing females priestesses would help solve this problem.\n\tEven though the Church could use many changes in our modern times, this does not lessen the massive amount of good the Church bestows on our world.  It is unfair for the media to expound the pedophilia within the Church when, really, it only occurred amongst a very low number of priests.  There is no doubt that pedophilia is a sickening crime that should be fought at every turn.  Nevertheless, there are thousands of good, innocent men out there who have contributed their lives to God for noble causes, and it is wrong to undermine the efforts of these men and lessen our view of the Catholic Church in general.\n",
        "I think that although either side is entitled to their opinion the overall idea is that there are American citizens who chose to love people in a nontraditional way, and are chastised for it. For people, like me who are for gay marriage I believe that homosexuals should be offered the same rights as heterosexuals because I feel that if they are feeling the same thing that I feel when I say I am in love with a man and are held back from taking the next step of marriage then its unfair. I also believe that we have to keep fighting for gay marriage because never in American history is something ever truly remembered and recognized if there wasn’t a struggle. Also its understandable, the opposition, because our society was built on heterosexual relationships, and for many this style of living is very weird, and different. What makes accepting homosexual relationships so difficult for some people is the sexual freedom, homosexuals can have sex with whomever they please and never get pregnant. I know from my friends that are homosexual that sometimes I feel the same way that people who oppose gay marriages feel because many of my friends have sex with their best friend’s partner like if its nothing and it’s something that should be expected because they are gay. So sometimes I understand where the opposition comes from because who would to legalize a sex free-for-all? However, I do believe that once homosexuals work out their kinks then people would be more receptive and vote to have gay marriages legalized.  \n\nPresident Bush needs to stop worrying about this small problem. No one is dying, no families are being left without a home, and no children are running around with guns, from homosexuality. But he has innocent Iraqis who aren’t for his never-declared-war being homeless and killed from the anger that other Iraqis have toward the U.S. If I remember correctly from my government class isn’t it up to the states to declare legalization of gay marriage before the federal government gets involved? Once again I believe that the federal government has bigger issues than this. \n\nPresident Bush is allowing his personal opinion to take precedent over society’s needs. Legalizing homosexual will not hurt anyone, so why is this such a huge deal in our society. I believe that President Bush is pushing this problem as a scapegoat for dealing with the bigger problems. The U.S. has bigger problems like there huge debt and the fact that many children die because they don’t have health care, but yet he wants to meddle in the lives of people who are different then him. \n",
        "      There is much controversy surrounding the issue of the legalization of marijuana.  The drug is known to have medicinal benefits, and it is legal in many other countries.  At the same time, it also leads users towards more harmful drugs.  Clearly, marijuana is illegal for a reason, and any decision to legalize it would be unwise and would endanger the health and safety of many people.  The current state, in which marijuana is illegal, is ideal and should be upheld firmly.\n\tMarijuana is commonly known as the gateway drug.  Many users begin drug use with marijuana, and go on to use more harmful drugs, such as heroin or ecstasy.  Marijuana is a mind and personality altering drug, with short term as well as long term effects, few of which can be deemed positive.  It is not only easy to transition from marijuana to more serious drugs, but it is easy to become addicted.  Drug addiction is nothing to be taken lightly, and legalizing marijuana, even in small quantities, would only add to this problem.  It is ambiguous to legalize “small amount of marijuana” and also probably very difficult to enforce.  It is much simpler and safer to keep marijuana illegal and not forget its mind-altering qualities and unpleasant behaviors associated with its use. \n\tDespite the clearly negative effects of marijuana use, many people wish to legalize it either for its medicinal benefits or because its effects seem similar to those of alcohol.  To those who claim that the health benefits outweigh the detriments, their argument might be worthy were it not for the addictive nature of marijuana.  A small dose of marijuana might be helpful in treating certain medical conditions, but such a treatment would also place the patient within the grasp of a lifelong substance addiction.  Depending on the necessity and frequency of marijuana treatments, patients could theoretically wind up cured of an ailment, but ripe for the development of an even more serious drug problem.  It is far better to use other treatments and keep the number of people with drug problems down to the bare minimum.\n\tThe effects of marijuana may seem no more severe than those of alcohol that it should be an illegal substance while alcohol is legal.  The effects of marijuana, however, are significantly more serious than those of alcohol.  The main reason for this is again, that marijuana is the gateway drug.  Alcohol use can lead to alcoholism, an addiction to one particular substance, but marijuana use can often lead to a myriad of drug addiction problems.  Society is familiar with the abusive relationships that can result from alcoholism, and it would not be wise to increase the amount of poor behavior by creating more people who are dependent upon a substance.  It is important that the serious effects of marijuana use not be downplayed in an attempt to justify its legalization.\n\tOverall, marijuana use had many problems associated with it that would only escalate if the drug became more prominent through its legalization.  The best policy regarding marijuana is to maintain the current no tolerance policy for this harmful drug, rather than try to find reasons justifying its legalization.\n",
        "\tGender discrimination is not a huge issue in today’s society, but it still lingers.  I feel like it is on par with racism.  Collectively, it is much less of a problem than it once was, but there are still instances in which it flares up.  No one speaks about it, either.\n\tFor the most part, employers want to maximize profits and minimize losses.  People don’t understand that it is costly to discriminate when it comes to hiring workers.  Women who have the same set of skills, or better skills, as other men who are not hired may be hired by some other employer.  Just look at the cosmetics industry.  Fifteen years ago, the higher ranks of the cosmetics industry were dominated by men, which seems counterintuitive.  It turns out that it was counterintuitive.  Mary Kay is an entrepreneur who was never promoted into the high ranks, so she started her own business.  With her superior set of skills, she constructed the Mary Kay cosmetics giant.  \n\tThe Mary Kay example should show employers that women are indeed capable of having brilliant ideas.  They are not going to turn them away anymore just because they are women.\n\tAt this point, there really isn’t anything that can be done to reduce the remaining gender discrimination in the United States.  There are some employers who are so set on discriminating that they will never change.  That is simply a fact of life.  They can choose to hire whomever they wish, at their own loss.  There is no way to force these bigots into hiring women.\n\tOn the whole, however, I think women have the same opportunities to succeed as men.  It is up to them to succeed in life.  I also think some women use gender discrimination as an excuse for their lack of success.  Because of this, it is difficult to gauge the severity of the problem.\n\tGender discrimination is not limited to women.  I think gay men are discriminated against in the workplace, especially if they have a particularly “manly” job like a police officer or firefighter.  They are subject to ridicule and lack of promotion to a much greater extent than women.  In fact, women in these positions may receive preferential treatment just so the organization looks as if it does not gender discriminate.\n\tSometimes, the nature of the job necessitates having a man over a woman.  Roofing, construction, and other physically demanding jobs are better suited to men.  It’s a fact of life that men are generally stronger than women, so when a job requires a great deal of strength, why would the employer hire a woman over a man?  In this case, it is not an example of gender discrimination.  Although there will be some women out there who will try to claim that they are being discriminated against.  Employers and women need to work together to make gender discrimination disappear completely.  There is nothing more that the government can do.  It is up to individuals to make this problem history.\n",
        "\tMarriage under the law is a civil institution to which all age-eligible U.S. citizens should be entitled. To say that marriage is a sacred institution between a man and women conflates a religious view of it with a secular one, which is not the business of the federal government. There is no good reason I can think of that gay people shouldn’t be allowed to get married. The bias against gay marriage reflects a deeply ingrained homophobia in American culture that we still haven’t rid ourselves of, for no apparent reason. Furthermore, I don’t think that the federal government needs to be mixing in this issue; it will ultimately be determined by the courts anyway.\n\tMany advocates of gay marriage have already made the point that heterosexual marriages can be loveless, estranged, or even abusive, and these are still fully sanctioned in the U.S. Really, I can’t foresee gay marriages possibly ending in worse terms than some straight ones already do. \n\tThe sole argument against gay marriage seems to be the one employing that oft-repeated “sacred institution” phrase. It might be a sacred institution in some religious practices, and organized religions are free to ban or accept whatever forms of marriage they want. It isn’t a sacred institution when a couple fills out some paperwork and is granted a marriage license, however, and that’s the only part of the government’s involvement that has any legal ramifications – marriages administered by justices of the peace and others notwithstanding, since they are officiating secular ceremonies. The law doesn’t stop gays from applying for driver’s licenses or gay bar owners from applying for liquor licenses; stopping them from getting a marriage license just does not make sense.\n\tAnyone who wants to have their relationship status as a married couple sanctioned by the federal government should be able to (with some exceptions for age and a few other factors). Gays are just as likely to have happy, healthy relationships, and even raise and provide good care for adopted children. It should not be the business of the government to go around denying recognition of this.\n\tI think that there is a generic threatened feeling that most straight males experience when they confront the notion of homosexuality. This could be because of cultural conditioning; in America, the idea of the macho Sylvester Stallone type has a very broad appeal, and that homosexuality endangers this. It could also be a leftover from a hunter-gatherer kind of instinct that details what a man should be on a subconscious level. Whatever it is, men need to get over it. I have mentioned men exclusively here, because it seems to me that women feel less threatened by the idea of lesbianism, for whatever reason. That is not to say that some women do not feel that way, but it seems as though in general this is not the case.\n\tIn the end, state supreme courts will be the ones to decide the issue on a case by case basis. The attempt at an amendment banning gay marriage is self-evidently ludicrous, and isn’t something the Congress should bother with. Hopefully sometime in the near future reason will win out.\n",
        "I believe that gender discrimination still exists towards men in that they are still looked down upon when they consider low key roles like being a stay at home dad or a nurse. For example in the movie Meet the Parents on the character’s Gaylord Fauker was constantly made fun of by her fiancée’s father because he was a nurse. I believe that men will never get out of the role of being the one that in authority, take a look at our world today there are constant examples of males in power: the Pope, and even the president up until next year’s candidate. \nGender discrimination is a mindset, and the world even today is still stuck in the mentality that woman aren’t supposed to be leaders and men are. It’s a mindset that subordinates women just because we are more sensitive about others. Society sets us as being missionaries, housewives, nurses, models, and even porn stars; these are traditional female roles, and although some men choose to occupy them they are deemed the ones who aren’t “man enough” to occupy leadership roles. \nGender discrimination still takes place in the workplace and in our society as a whole. If you look in magazines or in advertisements, women are always held by men or the men are always protecting the women. If a woman is holding a man or caressing a man it is seen as dominating and the man as being a punk. \nThe I Love New York 2 series is breaking this standard. No longer is a woman looking for a man who is going to stand up to his wife and be the head of the household. New York is looking for “her wife” someone to have dinner on the table for her when she comes home. When I heard her say this I was stunned because honestly I was like “what self-respecting man want to be called his wife’s wife”? Why does our society think this? Why was this my initial reaction instead nothing like it would have been had I heard a man say this? Once again I believe it was because of our society, our society engrains in us than the man should be the protector even if he is in subordinate position like a housedad or a secretary. \nFrom previous discussions with my friends who are adamant about our gender discriminations problems in our world today, I remembered them saying that women make less than men in corporate industries. I was at first totally oblivious to this notion but apparently it is still something that goes on to this day. I often think about situations like this in our world were we recognize something bad going on, now the next step is what do we to prevent it. The U.S. tries to make laws about it but there are always ways around laws. And if the woman speaks up she may be harassed at work. So if we recognize all these problems with the workplace how do we fix it so that the workplace can be a fair and just place where everyone can receive equal opportunities. \n\n",
        "\tMarijuana costs our legal system a great amount of money every year, yet has a tremendous potential to adversely affect those who use it.  It is indubitable that users of the drug can experience adverse effects in a number of ways.  It is harmful to the respiratory system, depositing tar and toxins in the lungs similarly to cigarettes.  In the first half of this century, there was a big push by a small group of people to create a state of “marijuana prohibition”, the push was successful, and we still have it in the majority of America today.\n\tMaybe in the end, marijuana prohibition is a good thing, because it prevents a “national overload” of usage.  For instance, it wouldn’t be good for everyone to be driving cars high all the time, we’d probably see a lot more accidents and traffic problems.  However, laws obviously don’t stop teenagers and adults alike from attaining and smoking marijuana.\n\tSo I guess the question we must be asking is “do the costs of prohibition outweigh its benefits?”.  The biggest benefit of marijuana prohibition is that it satisfies the majority of Americans who have a moral objection to smoking marijuana.  It keeps these people happy, as many of them say “if we repealed marijuana prohibition, our entire country would go down the moral toilet!” (as if it hasn’t already).\n\tHowever, keeping marijuana illegal is very costly.  Every time police arrest someone for smoking or possessing marijuana, there is a lot of state resources that must be expended to transport, detain, book, charge, and sentence that person.  Court fees, police fees, probate fees, and the like end up draining state coiffeurs of money that could better be spent somewhere else.\n\tBut honestly, I’m not sure that the money freed up by making marijuana decriminalized would really achieve any benefit which outweighs that of marijuana prohibition.  If we legalize marijuana fully, we will probably see an explosion in usage which will be nothing but detrimental for us as a country.  I know people who smoke marijuana and they are entirely debilitated when they do it.  I certainly wouldn’t want to live in a world where everyone is high all the time.\n\tThe city of Denver didn’t exactly legalize small amounts of marijuana for persons over 21, it “decriminalized” them.  This might be a good middle ground – we can still keep marijuana illegal, only it will be more of a citation than a full criminal charge.  My understanding is that, with decriminalization, possession of marijuana will be more like a speeding ticket than a criminal charge.  This would probably be a good middle ground, as we could keep marijuana under control, but not have to pay the costly fees that go along with marijuana being entirely illegal.\n\tAlso, if I were dying of cancer, I’d probably try marijuana, because chemotherapy probably sucks.\n\tHonestly, I don’t know the answer to this question; marijuana has never really been something that affected me directly, so I’m not sure what the best course of action is.  I trust our legislature to find the appropriate remedy to the marijuana problem.\n",
        "\tSince right after the attacks on our country on 9/11 we have been involved in a war. This war, the war in Iraq as it has been called, is fighting for a better life for those citizens of Iraq who have lived under control and in fear of the terrorist groups that reside there. For many of them, they had little hope until the United States showed up to help.\n\tThe war in Iraq has had its moments of ups and downs. Their have been times full of hope and times full of despair. We have lost a lot of men and women in Iraq, but we have also saved some lives; saved them from the terrible life they had been living.\n\tI believe that our forces are doing good things overseas. We have helped them to be freed from the evil forces that bound them, helped them to try to start over in finding a better life for their country. Many of Iraq’s people are no longer struggling in fear and a need to survive. There is hope for the people of Iraq now, no longer overcome by terrorist groups, this country has a chance. There is a chance for change, a chance for new beginnings. We have given them a new option, a new choice of freedom.\n\tI think that we need to stay overseas longer. For Iraq we have given them a strong starting point for which they can make a strong government off of, but our work is not done. Without our help I fear for what may happen to the citizens there. Will they be strong enough to stick to their new form, not to be taken under control as they were before? We have no way of completely knowing. We need to stand strong in Iraq continuing to fight, and to help them fight, for what we believe is best for them. Isn’t this what this war is all about?  Getting revenge for what we think is right, and helping other people. It is important to keep our goal in focus.\n      There are many conflicting views on this issue, which has led to many heated debates in our country. What do we do? Many feel as though it has gone on long enough, that we should get our men home and keep them safe. They feel that we are just risking more lives by staying there, that there is not much more we can do. But there is a lot that we can still do there. Many parts of Iraq have been destroyed in warfare, and many continue to be destroyed. Each day we hear more about what is going on overseas. From what I have heard the violence is not over. The United States needs to keep control in our hands. This is not a time to loosen our hold on the power. We have set Iraq up in the right direction, but without our guidance who knows where they could end up. It is important now to keep them heading in this direction. A direction towards the freedom and democracy that they deserve.\n",
        "\tAnother controversial issue is the legalization of marijuana. Marijuana seems to entice many people when they just want to “chill out”. Marijuana has been studied for years with scientific findings that prove that marijuana does not have positive effects on individuals. I do not think that most people truly know the side effects of marijuana and therefore feel that this is the drug, if any, to abuse. I believe that the city of Denver has made a mistake in legalizing small amounts of marijuana for people over the age of 21. Now, just like with alcohol, 21 year olds can buy for underage individuals. An underage individual does not even necessarily need a 21 year old; they just need his or her ID. I do not agree with the city of Denver and their decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana. \n\tIn my email portion of this study, my response was different from what it is now because in between the time, I learned more about the effects of marijuana and what it is doing to a persons body. Personally, I do not feel that marijuana provides any great feeling; I do not think it is that great to risk killing brain cells, or to risk damaging ones lungs. My grandfather was diagnosed with lung cancer almost one year ago. The doctors told him that he had two years to live. He smoked almost ever day of his adult life, cigarettes in the early years and then cigars in the later years. My grandfather was not smoking marijuana, he was smoking tobacco-there is no difference because they produce similar results. I went to visit my grandfather last weekend; he lies in a bed, it hurts to sit up in a chair, he can not move on his own, he needs two nurses to help him go to the bathroom. The cancer moved from his lungs to his bones; he fell a few times, first breaking his left arm and then his hip. My grandfather is 75 years young and was told that he had seven to ten months to live. I do not know what it would feel like to know this. I would probably wonder why this had to happen. My grandfather can not go home in his final months of life; he was placed in a nursing home on Thanksgiving Day. My grandmother can not take care of him on her own- she says all she can do is pray for him. With my grandfather in mind and the memory of him I do not agree with the legalization of marijuana. \n\tI do not feel that marijuana should be legal, but I feel that marijuana’s effects are not as great as alcohol. I do not want alcohol to be illegal, but I feel that it is more lethal then marijuana. Many people abuse alcohol; they believe they can become a different person when under the influence. All alcohol does is make one lose their inhibitions and place one in a situation that they will most likely regret the next day. Marijuana can be used without making a person totally incapable of functioning. I have seen more people pass out or “black out” from alcohol then from marijuana. I have also seen that more people drive when under the influence of marijuana, rather then alcohol, showing that people feel the same or close to the same. Most would not risk getting into a car with a drunk driver, hopefully they would not let a drunk driver in the car seat, but many would not think twice about getting in the car with someone who was high. \n\tPeople are going to make their own choices about the matter of marijuana whether it is legal or not. I believe that Denver took a step in the wrong direction and hopefully other states do not follow in their footsteps. \n",
        "\tThe internet has gotten out of control. With all of the “social networking utilities” such as Facebook, MySpace, BuddyPic, and the countless others, everyone’s identity is up for sale.  Actually, since all of the aforementioned websites are free to join, people don’t even have to steal your identity anymore – they can take it for free.  The public needs to be reminded constantly that anything you say on the internet as well as every single description of yourself you post on websites are a permanent, signed statement that can never be erased and will never be forgotten barring a nuclear explosion that wipes out every single server on the planet.  \n\tWhen I heard that school officials prevented a school shooting because one of the shooters posted a MySpace bulletin about it, I was overjoyed.  I do no consider that an invasion of privacy at all.  By definition, an “invasion” of privacy would imply that the school officials went above and beyond normal means to obtain private information about a student.  First of all, logging onto the internet and going to a website is not by any means going above and beyond normal means, and second of all any information on the internet that you don’t even need a password to access is by any means private!  School officials – especially the ones in charge of safety – not only shouldn’t be scorned for scanning these websites from time to time, but they should be encouraged to.  Police and other authorities scan these pages all the time to successfully help prevent child molesters, sexual predators and other various incarnations of stalkers from harming or abusing other people. \n\tNo line should be drawn when it comes to the internet.  People – even kids – should be informed appropriately so they know what they are getting into when they sign up and join websites such as Facebook, MySpace, BuddyPic, etc.  I am not calling for a Big Brother or 1984 style government spying on citizens; I am just calling for the citizens to have some common sense and to show some basic logical judgment.  If this is too much to ask for any specific person, then that person should not be allowed to even use a powerful tool such as a computer.  In some senses, one could argue that a computer with access to the internet can be more powerful and destructive than a car – ask anyone who has had their identity stolen or bank funds drained.  A license to use the internet may sound extreme, but I think it would not be completely illogical.\n\tAs a closing note, I would like to say that I myself am part of Facebook and MySpace.  I do not use these websites for any other purpose then to keep in touch with friends that I know in real life.  I have never and would never write or hold conversations on these utilities that I wouldn’t say loudly in a crowded room of strangers. Then again, I believe I have common sense.\n",
        "\tOf course gender discrimination is still an issue. It would be ludicrous to expect that a society born and bred on millennia of European paternalistic social modes would shed them in under a century. The problem is that examples of discrimination have become harder to recognize; it’s no longer kosher to avoid promoting a female worker or to make overt and unwelcome sexual comments to them (not to say that this doesn’t happen). Gender discrimination has just become a deeply imbedded part of life, instead of a more visible one.\n\tOne could argue that the reason there aren’t as many females in high-level corporate or political roles is that there aren’t many clamoring for the positions. There is some truth to this, at least in the political realm; there simply aren’t as many female candidates as there are males. But a more truthful outlook asks another question: why not? Despite the advances made by the feminist movement, we still live in a society in which a female’s role is predetermined to involve child-rearing and, to some extent, housekeeping, although I think the latter has shifted a fair amount within the last quarter-century. More women are leaving their homes for the workplace, but this is often greeted with a kind of lukewarm encouragement from certain portions of the political and social spectrum, and sometimes snarling discouragement (anyone remember Rick Santorum’s remarks to this effect? We should all be thankful that he’s out of a job now). In the eyes of many people, the equality between genders exists in name only. For example, ponder whether or not the government will consider reinstating the draft anytime soon. Answer: nope. They’d have to wrestle with the question of whether to draft women, and no politician wants to touch that issue with a thirty-nine and a half foot pole.\n\tOn the flipside, men sometimes receive backlash from the phenomena known as “reverse discrimination.” It occasionally happens that the perceived need to promote female employees on the part of managers and otherwise could result in qualified males being ignored. Much the same argument is made in regards to race. While I don’t have statistics sitting here in front of me, I can’t imagine that this would be a large portion of the working male population though, and probably actually involves very few (think “the fingers on my two hands”).\n\tWhat we do about gender discrimination is a complicated question. There are a lot of possible answers. First should be our language, I think. It sounds absurd, but male-oriented linguistic formations help shape the way we understand and order reality. Here’s a smattering of examples: the ubiquitous use of phrase such as “mankind” or “man” to describe all of humanity, the preference for male pronouns when referring to non-specific persons or person in hypothetical situations, and the bizarre attribution of female gender to thoroughly unsexed objects (ships, for example). Another route to go is the old tried ‘n true method of education. People need to be taught about gender differences and similarities so that they don’t go around building absurd notions based upon faulty foundations. This won’t take care of the issue, but it won’t take care of itself, either.\n",
        "\tMyspace, facebook, and many other online websites have sprung up all over the internet. There is not one person that I know that is not a member of at least one of these websites. They allow you to connect with people from all over the country, sharing common interests. Your profile consists of pictures, an about me section, maybe even a clip of your favorite song. Sounds great right?\n\tSometimes these websites aren’t all they are cracked up to be. How do we know that the person we are communicating with is really who they say we are? The truth is we don’t. When not using these websites to communicate with people we already know, anything can be said on the internet. You can put up and picture you want, and only right the most appealing stuff about yourself that everyone with access to a computer can see. That’s the real point, anyone with a computer can have an account, and anyone can create a profile under any alias they want. Your information is not safe.\n\tSo this leads to the problem of privacy rights. Recently a school was able to prevent a school shooting from information they received on myspace. Is this an invasion of privacy? \n\tI don’t think that the school violated any rights by looking at myspace. I can see both sides of the argument. The child thinks that it is his or her right and privacy to be able to have a profile on a website like myspace and not have to censor him/her. This is true, however it is not your right. The moment you enter something onto any website you are putting it out there for anyone to be able to see. The entire World Wide Web, with millions and millions of people from all over the country, now has access to the information you presented about yourself. The internet leaves little room for privacy rights. On certain websites there are privacy settings, allowing only certain people to view your information, censoring it from view to the public. But these rights can only go so far. What you need to remember is that everything that you do on the internet is subject to being seen by the entire world, if they know where to look for it.\n\tAs for the school preventing a shooting, this little tip from myspace saved what could have been a tragedy. The school was not wrong in receiving their information from this source. I don’t know if they were responding to a tip that someone gave them or not, but they probably were tipped off by someone. If you are going to put information like that on the internet, you need to be aware of the audience that could be viewing it. A bulletin on myspace is sent out to everyone who you are friends with.\n      I don’t think school officials should go searching myspace looking for a problem, but if information is presented to them, they have just as much of a right as anyone else with a computer to check up on it. In this case, the school was right in following their lead. This information prevented something terrible from happening.\n\n",
        "Subject Number 15:\n\n2. GAY MARRIAGE:  While some states have legalized gay marriage, others are still opposed to it.  Do you think either side is right or wrong?  Why?  How do you feel about President Bush’s push for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage?  Should the federal government be involved in this issue?\n\n\n\tI do not think that the president should be allowed to even propose such an idea as banning gay marriage. I understand that he is a Christian, and that in the eyes of Christianity, gay marriage can not happen, which I agree with, being a Christian. However, I do feel that there are some things that can be addressed that would satisfy both desires of both groups of people. \n\tFirst off, I agree that there should be no such thing as gay marriage. Marriage is by definition between a man and a women (in the Bible) who can then produce offspring and raise a family if they so choose in the eyes of the Lord. For other religions too, it would be to raise their offspring in the eyes of whoever that head of the religious sect is. However, with same sex marriages, there is no possibility for the production of offspring, and thus the population would die out and there is no one to teach the religion to. \n\tI feel that if those of the same sex wish to get married, then it should be called something other then a marriage, because it is not ever able to be a full marriage as seen in the eyes of God. However, by calling it something else, other then the term Civil Union, which is also used for heterosexual couples, they can gain the same feeling of respect and trust as marriages seen though the eyes of the church. \n\tInsurance companies would be able to recognize them, and so would the government for tax purposes. They would be able to gain all of the governmental benefits as normal families (in the fact that it is a man and a women) are able to obtain. I believe that those people of the same sex should be able to partake in some sort of ceremony to solidify their union, and make it seem more personal. \n\tI do not however think that the government should be able to gain any say into the situation after it has been established that they are able to \"wed\" for lack of a better term. Other then the initial name and word usage approved by the federal government, they should not be able to tell which states allow it and which ones do not. The state governments should not be allowed to do the same either, because then that would be a form of discrimination. \n\tI do not think that there should be an amendment added to the Constitution either, because to marry or to have a union between the same sex is a personal matter. Personal choices should not be paraded around on a Constitution, so President Bush should not be able to ban personal choices. Our country is based off of freedom, and not purely rules and regulation. If it were then we would not be a free country. The constitution is about giving guidelines for our country to follow, not telling us what to do or not do at every point and turn of our lives.  \n",
        "\tI absolutely feel as though the Catholic Church has to change its ways in order to \nadapt to the 21st century.  Two major issues come to my mind when I think of the \nCatholic Church; those issues are Gay marriage and abortion.  I am a very liberal person \nand I see eye to eye with many of the political views held my leftist in the political world.  \nThus I believe that gays should be allowed to marry just as any other couple that is in \nlove should have the right to marriage and obviously I also believe that women should \nhave the choice to abort a pregnancy should the circumstance present itself.  The church \ndoes not believe that either should be allowed and its justification comes from religious \ndoctrine that was given or written for us thousands of years ago.  I don’t want to seem \nlike I am mooching the church but to be honest things change drastically in a matter of \ndecades let alone in a matter of centuries.  We have the proper medical procedures to \nperform abortions with out harming the women.  Furthermore, to quote church doctrine \nthat is older than time, and say that a man can not marry another man because in the bible \nit says that marriage is between a man and a women is preposterous.  In the biblical times \nif somebody were to come out and pronounce there homosexuality they could be subject \nto blood letting or a lobotomy, you know to get the “gay out of them.”  Heck if you want \nto go back even further there are numerous written accounts of homosexual acts within \nthe Spartan male communities as well as with in the Greek schools for men.  Older \nSpartans would regularly engage in acts of homosexuality with younger Spartans and it \nwas perfectly permissible.  This leads me right into my next topic which would be older \nclergy men, specifically priests over stepping their bounds and engaging in sexual acts \nwith younger church going boys.  What is the difference between Sparta and the churches \nin Boston where Priests were raping boys?  In Sparta it was part of the culture, in \nAmerica it is a clear act of rape preformed by a priest that is sexually uneasy due to years \nof celibacy and perhaps in many cases unrequited love.  The Catholic Church needs to \nstart to allow their priests to marry.  It may seem ridiculous due to centuries of church \nrule against it, however, a married sexually fulfilled priest could perform his job just as \nwell as a celibate one, and without the worry of perhaps raping a boy.  Rabbi’s and \nministers of all other religions are permitted to marry and live normal lives all the while \ndevoting themselves to their work and their God.  Along the same lines, women are also \nallowed to be Rabbi’s and Ministers, to not allow women to be Catholic Priests is a major \ngender discrimination that our country has overlooked for far too long.  It is time for the \nChurch to meet the times, steps need to be taken to modernize what is now becoming an \noutdated major religious movement.    \n",
        "\tThe Iraqi war is definitely an event that I do not agree with the Bush Administration on. I think that it is pointless killing that will not solve any problems and it is time to bring our troops home before more fatalities occur. We have been over there for several years now, and we have yet to see anything get accomplished. It almost feels as though Bush is continuing this war for his own selfish ambition rather than the reasons he originally stated for it. I think that Bush has lost a lot of support by keeping our troops in Iraq for so long, yet he does not seem to care. It seems as though there is some ulterior motive or something because what he is doing just does not seem to make sense. I think that he should put himself in the shoes of the soldiers who are in Iraq and maybe he will see how ridiculous and unreasonable he is being. I am sure that if he were over in Iraq fighting a war with no end or solution in sight he would wonder what the point is too. This war has definitely gone on long enough and it is about time it ends.\n\tIt almost seems as though the United States is incapable of staying out of the affairs of other countries. Iraq is its own country and therefore should be permitted to deal with its own problems and establish its own government. We should not have to sacrifice the mothers, fathers, children, brother, sisters, etc of American families so that Bush can continue his pointless war. Sadaam is gone; there is no authority figure to fight anymore. If a country does not want our help, who are we to move in and try to take over? If they want to blow each other up, that is their choice, but unless they make a personal attack on the U.S., then Bush should just mind his own business. There are so many problems we are dealing with back in the States, and I think that Bush should deal with those before he goes and tries to fix the problems of others. Although the United States has a lot of things going for it and a lot of positives, this country is far from perfect, so it seems a little hypocritical to go and tell another country how to leave when we do not even have it all together. Iraq was built on different terms and religious values, and if they are rejecting the values that the U.S. is trying to instate, then Bush should just let it go. If they really wanted our help they would ask or at least stop killing American soldiers. At this point, it almost seems as though the killing is more Bush’s fault than the Iraqis. He knows what is going on over there and that nothing is being accomplished. It is his responsibility to put an end to all this craziness and just bring everyone home. \n",
        "\tIt is a silly question to ask if gender discrimination still exists.  No offense to the creator of the question, but it is really self-evident.  One cannot ask if a certain mindset exists, whether it is one of good or evil, because it always will.  The world will never be rid of any state of mind, any hatred, any prejudice, because somewhere someone will always hold every mindset and belief.  The world is just too damn big to think that something such as discrimination, whether it is religious, sexist, racist, or whatever, will ever not exist.  There will always be bigots.  In this way, there is nothing we can do to end gender discrimination.  We can work to diminish it, but it will unfortunately always exist.  So on that note, does it still exist in the workplace?  Certainly.  If it exists in the mindset of employers, then it exists in the workplace.  Now we must take a second here to draw a distinction, because there are obviously situations where discrimination is necessary.  After all, discrimination at a basic level means no more than the ability to distinguish between two things.  That being said, there are certain jobs where an employer needs to pick a man over a woman, or a woman over a man.  If a job involves heavy lifting, an employer is always going to pick a man over a woman, unless the woman used to be a professional weight lifter.  This is not a bad form of discrimination: being able to make distinctions between what a woman’s capabilities are and what a man’s capabilities are is a necessary part of being an employer.  The only cases we are looking at are when a woman and a man are equally qualified to hold a certain position, and the employer chooses solely on gender, or perhaps when the gender not chosen for the position is better qualified and the other sex wins solely on gender.  Even this is very hard to call, because all choices are opinions and perspectives anyway.  What may seem like a case of gender discrimination to one person may have actually been a judgment call based on personality on the part of the employer.  It is very hard to come out and call something discrimination because the discrimination only exists in the mind of the employer.  The employer will never come out directly and say, “I pick you for the job because you are a man and I don’t want a woman working here.”  So what can be done about this problem?  Nothing, really.  How can one expect to change how people think?  Should we try some sort of affirmative action for females?  Absolutely not.  First of all, it’s not really working for minorities, so why should it work for women?  And second of all, won’t this just give women an unfair advantage?  There is really no way to ensure perfect equality as far as job opportunities go.  All we can do is set standards for what we expect out of our employers, and hope for the best.\n\n",
        "The city of Denver has decided to make small amounts of marijuana legal. I do not think that this is a good idea at all. Who is to say what amount is a small amount? What is a large amount? There is no way that people can agree on how much is a small amount. If you are going to legalize the drug then legalize the drug in its entirety. Do not do it half way. There is no reason for it. Studies have shown that this drug is not only harmful to your body, but, it is also the gateway drug to more intense drugs such as cocaine, ecstasy and heroine. This drug is meant to give you a high, or a good feeling. Other drugs such as alcohol are meant to do the same thing and that is illegal for people under the age of twenty one. If they wanted to legalize it, I guess it would be more practical to set and age limit which is much more clear to the public than “a small amount.” The only problem with this would be, who decides what age is appropriate to make this decision? Should it be the same as alcohol? These are all questions that people must find a clear cut answer to before anything is finalized. Children, younger and younger each year, are experimenting with marijuana and for most, it leads to other drug use. These other drugs are illegal so why legalize something that has been proven to lead people to the use or experimentation with them? If they United States plans on legalizing a small amount of marijuana they should just make it all legal. Sometimes, it is the fact that it is so wrong and against some law that makes rebellious children experiment. They get such an adrenaline rush from the fact that it is not allowed. I do not agree with the use of this drug, however, if it were legal, and almost a norm, I think less people would be inclined to do it. Then it could also be taxed and more expensive which will turn people, especially kids, away from it. A friend of mine who uses marijuana somewhat often says that that is one of the big reasons for why he got started. He does not regret it, but, he said that the thrill of going against what your parents and society told you to do gave him such a high. He loved making decisions on his own instead of abiding by what was drilled into his head since he was a small child. He has nothing but good things to say about marijuana. It’s strange. Out of all of my friends, marijuana users and non  marijuana users, he has the highest average in school, has a job, and does service learning. He also plays lacrosse, soccer, and basketball. This can only make you wonder if the drug really is as harmful as they say. I guess we will just have to do more research.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "      The legalization of marijuana never used to be a constant debate in my mind. I was once a person who had a set mind against drugs of any type. The reason for this stubbornness, I have come to realize, is that I was ignorant in the field of drugs. All of public schools make blatant attempts to turn students away from any type of drugs and/or alcohol. Coming from a traditionally Catholic family, my parents were also against the use of these substances. Once I entered high school, I obtained friends who turned out to be “Pot Heads.” I realized when I met some of these people that they were some of the nicest persons that I had ever met. My biased stereotype on “stoners” was that if they used drugs, they were bad people. Meeting these nice people who happened to smoke marijuana finally allowed me to realize that using drugs did not necessarily make someone a bad person. Meeting my friends who smoked marijuana has forever changed my opinion to the view that “pot” should be legalized in the United States.\n\n\tIt has come to my attention recently that Denver, Colorado, has legalized “small amounts of marijuana.” If the national law is that marijuana is illegal, then I believe that it should not be legal within the Denver city limits. There is already a huge underground market for marijuana, and the government has no control over it. If the U.S. government would make the drug legal for the entire country to use, people would not be smoking joints laced with cocaine, etc. The government would be helping people if they would take control of this issue. Since the under ground marijuana market is big in the United States, it displays how little control the government can have over its people. If the legalization of marijuana occurred within the United States, then the government would more-so be able to display its authority over people by destroying pot’s black market and protecting its citizens from “hard” drugs.\n\n\tMarijuana is such a common drug that some people do not even consider it a “drug.” I personally have never smoked “pot,” but marijuana is not a bad thing- especially if the government would come to be in charge of its distribution. Pot calms down its users and affects their responsiveness. This does not hurt anyone, but instead makes them happy for the most part. If the drug is not legalized, then the black market money will go to things such as the distribution of even worse drugs, such as cocaine, etc. If the U.S. government would legalize pot, then the profits or tax on the drug could go to building schools, homeless shelters, etc. It is currently easy enough to buy marijuana to the point where if I wanted to, I could find a way to buy it right now. Most countries in the world do not care if their citizens smoke pot because they feel as though it is a personal choice. The U.S., however, is arresting teenagers because the kids are doing something to their own body to have some fun.\n\n      Previous presidents such as Bill Clinton have tried marijuana, so why can our citizens not? If one drives their car while high, they will most likely be going at a slow rate. This is better than driving drunk, because a drunk driver could do more damage at higher speeds. I believe that “weed” should be treated as an equal of alcohol. If the government’s job is to keep its citizens safe, then why is it that they are allowing drug money to go to waste due to not legalizing pot? This money is going to guns instead of people. Marijuana is not a bad thing, and the U.S. government should join the rest of the world in legalizing it.\n#29\n\n",
        "\tThis is one issue that I am completely on one side.  Gay people should be allowed to marry.  There really isn’t a good reason not to let them marry.  Those who oppose it say that it would “compromise the family unit.”  Are you kidding me?  This is their main argument.  Can they see into the future and know that married gay people will destroy family life?  No.  They have no factual basis for their argument.  Gay people are perfectly capable of raising children, maybe even more so that heterosexual couples.  I say this because two gay people who want to have kids must overcome disapproval from society so much so that if they only kinda wanted kids, they would not do it.  Consequently they would most likely be excellent parents.\n\tThis issue only exists because of homophobes and the Catholic Church.  They have this idea that if gays are allowed to marry, Armageddon is sure to follow.  The truth is that the vast majority of people in this world are heterosexual.  The gay people aren’t going to take over the world.  They simply want to have the same rights as straight couples.  Gay people should not be punished for something they were born with.  It is perfectly natural to be gay, just as it is perfectly natural to have red hair.\n\tDo people think gay people want to be gay?  Who would want to put up with all the ridicule they must endure throughout their lives?  What if we were to say that straight biracial couples could not marry?  Doing such a thing would be out of the question.  I feel that it’s the same way with gay marriage.  There really is no difference from a normal marriage except that gay people cannot procreate.  So what?  This is where the Catholic Church gets involved.  They autocratically declare that God says it is necessary for married couples to have children.  God didn’t tell them anything.  He tells the pope, the priests, whomever, about as many things as He tells a frog.  The Catholic Church should limit themselves to matters of faith, because they have no physical proof or facts for anything, including the existence of God.  \n\tThe only reason people are opposed to gay marriage is that they’re homophobic.  Gay people aren’t out to hurt straight people.  They just want to share each others’ love through marriage.  We will look back 100 years from now and wonder how we could be so barbaric, forbidding two people to marry based on sexual orientation.  This is the most apparent form of civil rights today, bar none.  It’s outrageous that people are opposed to this.  This is like going back in time 2000 years ago, when women were not allowed to own land.  It’s ridiculous.  And the most frustrating thing about it is that it will not hurt the people who are so opposed to it.  Allowing gay marriage can only help people.\n\tGeorge Bush’s amendment is a clear violation of civil rights.  It is an abomination that such a thing can even be suggested in today’s government.  The federal government should get involved, and they should make it completely legal for two gay people to marry.\n",
        "There are a lot of things one can say about the Catholic Church in this day and age.  The Catholic Church has been around in various incarnations for centuries.  It has changed and evolved since it began, but the big question is has it changed enough?  There are numerous arguments against the Church changing, one of these is that the church cannot be wrong because it follows the teachings of the Bible.  A glaring problem with this is that the Bible did not arrive by fax from heaven.  It was written by man.  Not only was it written by man, there are many books that did not make it into the bible, which were written.  These books may have even lent more to our understanding of Christianity as a whole.  The point is that the Catholic Church must move with the times.  As humans change, so must the systems that serve as their support systems.  Catholicism is working under the same rules it has worked under for centuries.  Many of the rules and expectations from the church are antiquated and obsolete.  Others were rules which were made for political and financial reasons and are now seen as religious obligations.  The reason priests are not allowed to marry in the Catholic Church is a rule which was originally made to make the Church money.  The land owned by the priests (on which the church stood) would, if the priest had a family, go to his son, rather than the church.  This would cause the church to lose both the land and the church that stood on the land.  Why shouldn’t a priest be allowed to have a family? In almost every other Christian sect a pastor is married or is allowed to, it gives them a chance at a full life.   Priests are human, just like anyone else.  They deserve the right to live as all humans live, with love, both emotional and physical.  However, this is not the only way in which the church is stuck in the middle ages.  Many other rules are outdated as well.  Women are no different from men, so why should they not be allowed to be priests?  Women have the same ability to be spiritual leaders.  It is understandable that in older time periods women were seen as inferior to men, and it is even understandable that the church viewed women this way.  The symbolism in the Old Testament makes it clear that women are more susceptible to “sin” in the eyes of the church.  In modern times however, we know that women and men are no different from each other, and can do the same things.  We have women in places of power in every other aspect of life, there is no reason for women to be kept down in the church. So many things about the Church are good, but so many others are the exact opposite.  The Church needs to move into the twenty-first century.  So many people trust in the Church as their guiding force, and so it must move with the times and keep ahead of the darkness that people face.  \n",
        "\tTo start off writing about gay marriage, let me talk a little about my personal feelings about homosexuality.  I don’t believe that anyone is meant to be homosexual.  To me, this makes no sense at all.  Male and females were given opposing genitalia for a reason, and that reason isn’t just for diversity.  Females and males are counterparts, made differently in order to ensure reproduction and the continuance of the human race.  If the same gender was meant to be together, there would be a natural means for reproduction.  And I’m sure there are some cases in nature when homosexuality, even asexuality and other strange forms of reproduction exist and completely legitimate.  However, I just don’t see this in humans at all.  So what is homosexuality then?  I believe it’s no more than a chemical imbalance in the brain.  Too much of one hormone, not enough of another. . .there have been definitive studies confirming that the actual brains of homosexuals are different, and more closely related to the brain of the opposite sex.  Some may see this as proof that homosexuals are born to be gay, but I see this is just a simple problem that can be fixed.  While most homosexuals would refuse to believe that their homosexuality is a “chemical imbalance” and see their homosexuality as something that makes them special, I think it is no more than a mutation that should eventually be wiped out of the human race due to homosexual’s inability to reproduce.  While this view is probably offensive towards gays, it is to me the most logical explanation for their unnatural actions.\n\tKeeping this in mind, I have absolutely no problem with gay marriage.  While I don’t think gay marriage is right, it’s none of my business what the homosexuals do.  They can have all the gay sex they want and get married and whatever else might please them as long as this has no effect on me, which it logically shouldn’t.  So whose business is it?  Why, the church of course!  Isn’t that where marriages happen?  And if it is not a marriage in the church, then wherever they choose to get married.  It should be up to the institutions that perform marriages to decide.  If a church or institution determines that they will not allow gay marriage, then so be it.  But gays should be allowed to go to a different institution that believes similarly and get married.  And who above all else should have no say about this?  Why, the president of course.  President Bush’s proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage infuriates me like no other.  The constitution, which is a document that ensures undeniable rights to all humans, has no place for articles denying liberties.   Honestly, why in God’s name would the president try to defile such an important and groundbreaking piece of history with such a silly and ridiculous amendment such as the one he is proposing?  The only reason he himself is against same sex marriage is because of his religion, which should hold no say in government!  Why does he think he can impose his specific religious views on an entire goddamn country?  I can’t talk about this anymore I’m so infuriated.\n\n",
        "      The history of the Catholic Church is a history of criticism and scandal.  For many years, Catholic officials used their power to stifle the creativity and scientific research of the time.  Today the Church is no longer an enemy of learning, but a critical observer of the ways in which we use new knowledge.  As science and technology advance at an astronomic pace, is it not the role of religious institutions to remain steadfast to faith, to remain a stable presence in the otherwise fickle lives of its believers?  \n      The Catholic Church takes many positions on current issues that many people oppose.  For example, it is against abortion and the death penalty, a position that I completely agree.  The Catholic Church advocates the rights of human beings, most importantly their right to live, at every stage of that life.  The Church often goes beyond a defense based on Christian beliefs, and explains its position in terms of the contemporary, material world that we live in.  For example, the Church informs people of the fact that it costs more to execute a criminal than to imprison him for life.  It also tries to educate people about the gross injustice that plagues the criminal justice system.  Statistics show that a majority of the criminals put to death are poor and members of a minority.  These are the people that don’t have the big bucks to pay big-shot attorneys and afford appeal after appeal after appeal.\n      A substantial amount of members of the Catholic Church desire changes in the hierarchal power structure that governs the Church as an institution.  Like most other institutions before the feminist movement, the Catholic Church is ruled by men.  Only men are allowed to become priests, bishops, cardinals, and of course, pope.  Men who belong to these vocations are not allowed to marry (although, there are very rare cases in which a married Protestant minister desires to convert to Catholicism and becomes a priest, and he is allowed to do so as a married man).  However, in terms of everyday life and function of the Church, it can be argued that women play an equal if not greater role than men.  Because there is such a lack of men entering the priesthood, the responsibility of the lay people in each parish has greatly increased.  Here women can exercise a certain amount of authority.  Yet, I can’t help but wonder if the priesthood would be so lacking if it were opened up to women.  And the child molestation scandal would certainly have been discovered and dealt with much sooner.  Because the problem was not only the pedophiles, but the priests who kept their secrets.  I find it very hard to believe that any women would stay silent amidst such behavior.\n\tReligious doctrines and tenets of one’s faith are elements of one’s life that are supposed to remain as a constant.  They are supposed to be integral part of their believers, and serve to guide them in their observations of the world and their experiences in it.  However, the Church as an institution, a creation of society, should be open to change as the society in which it operates grows and develops.  We have become a society which more and more recognizes the equal rights of women and values their talents and capabilities.  Maybe it’s time the Catholic Church did the same. \n",
        "\tI don’t feel that the Catholic Church needs to change if it does not want to.  The beliefs within the Catholic Church are their beliefs and it is not up to anybody but themselves to decide whether to change their ways or not.  Though I feel it would be nice if they were to become more open about certain issues (allowing female priests, allowing gay marriage, etc) I don’t feel that it is in my power, public power, or the governments power to force them to change.  This would be no different than them forcing their beliefs on everybody else.\n\tThe whole ordeal with pedophilia within the Catholic Church has been restricted to only several locations and people tend to make a bigger deal out of it than it actually is.  There is pedophilia in many more places than the Catholic Church and people only see it as a big deal there because priests are supposed to be moral teachers to those who attend the church.  In order to deal with this issue it would be best if they were to get background checks on who is becoming a priest and determine their real motive.  Most priests and members of the Catholic Church frown upon this behavior and see it as a disgrace.\n\tWhile some of the views held within the Catholic Church are outdated, nobody should force them to flow with the sands of time.  If part of their belief system relies on following works of the past, then so be it.  As long as they allow me to go about my own personal business, I have no problem with allowing them to go about theirs.  They disagree with what I believe and I may disagree with what they believe.  That is how our society functions.  It is not a “one way” nation.  Freedom is what allows us to keep our same views, even if they are the same views that we’ve had for centuries and it is what allows us to change our views, even if it goes against the grain.\n\tI don’t think that anything can really be done to prevent cases of pedophilia or any other kind of church corruption since this is all reliant on the person.  Whether it be those who are in charge of the church or the priest themselves, what happens relies on them and it is up for the people of the church to speak up against it, not someone who is not a member.  For example: I am not an employee of a McDonalds, therefore I have no right to rise up against the McDonalds manager and try to bring him down.  Granted, changes could be made for the better of the employees, I would not have a full blown knowledge of the entire situation.\n\tThis is not to say that what is going on is right.  By no means is it right to allow this to take place.  That is why we have the court system, where religion is forgotten and the law is brought in.  Separation of church and state does not protect crime.\n",
        "      I do feel that in some ways, the Catholic Church needs to change in order to adapt to life in the 21st century.  I do, however, completely understand the reasoning that some people would have who would be opposed to this change.  But for those who would say something along the lines of the following, I disagree:  “The Catholic Church should not need to change its ways to adapt.  What is happening is that people are just drifting further away from the Church.  Yes, the world is changing, but that just means that we need to hold stronger to the truths and ways of the Church.”\n\tI disagree with the above reasoning because I believe that many of the “laws” of the Catholic Church were made merely by humans who were looking to further the Catholic Church politically, not to enhance the spiritual lives of its followers.  For example, if you look at the example of not eating before receiving Holy Communion, you see that this rule has change over the years.  A couple of decades ago, pre-Vatican II, you were not allowed to eat anything from around late Saturday night until after church on Sunday morning so that your body would be empty and ready to receive the body of Christ.  Now, that rule has been changed to be that you should refrain from eating approximately one hour before receiving communion.  Who came up with either of these “rules” and who changed them?  Humans.  I do not feel that I am lacking spiritually because I can eat closer to the time of communion than, say, my parents, who when they were younger had to follow the earlier rule.  Many trivial rules such as this deter people who were raised as Catholics but not choose not to practice their religion.  \n      From my personal experience, and from talking to other people, I get the impression that with all of the rules and regulations, many people adopt an “all or nothing” approach; if they don’t feel that they can play by all of the rules, then they figure why bother.  Because of this, I feel that the Catholic Church is losing members.  Many people are raised Catholic, but do not actively participate in the Church once they get to the age where their parents no longer force them to attend mass.  I believe that if some of the rules were adapted to the 21st century, then maybe more people would play an active role in the Church and truly practice the Catholic faith.  \n      Regarding the issue of allowing priests to marry, I think that they should be allowed.  As a member of the congregation, it is sometimes difficult to connect with the priest because he leads a life that is so different from your own.  Were priests allowed to marry, they would have much more in common with their parishioners and could better reach them spiritually as a result.  I think that if priests were allowed to marry, this might prevent some of the instances of pedophilia.  I think that in many cases, some of the men who are priests today became priests during an era when homosexuality was not as openly accepted as it is today.  If they did not want to marry, another option for men was to become a priest, because this avoided the question of why you were not getting married.  However, some of these men had built-up sexual tension, which they took out inappropriately on children of the church.  \n",
        "\tThe Catholic Church definitely needs to change its ways to adapt to the 21st Century.  Over the course of time the Church officials have blindly enforced traditions of the Catholic history to aim at, but not obtains, a higher means of humanity; a humanity where virtues such as humility and service, among others, flourish in a harmonious mankind.  While their aims may provide virtuous characters, virtuous because they are working towards such a high good and their actions along the way are thus better, the end is far from realistic.  Some of the means by which to obtain this good are also unrealistic in contemporary society.  \n\tBack in history, groups of people could and were pressure to use a good amount of their time for worship and the furthering of their own spirituality through religion.  Today’s world presses individuals to lead much more busy and multi-focused lives where it is hard to put so much focus, time, and devotion in to one practice.  Some of the Protestant churches, while stressing its importance, do not require a strict attendance schedule for all followers.  The Catholic Church is fairly strict about its once-a-week requirement to worship and this can be hard to accomplish today.  Additionally it seems as though this time where people should go to look for further spiritual development outside their everyday life is made empty and meaningless as it becomes a monotonous series of routines aimed at a blind goal.  \n\tAnother area where the Catholic Church needs to bring its views in to the contemporary society is science.  Many of the teachings and viewpoints on the church obviously came very early on in history; starting around 2000 years ago and going up through the middle of the second millennium.  During this time there was little explanation for unnatural occurrences, and even some natural occurrences, other than the supernatural.  Now with ever-evolving scientific theories, methods, and technologies, numerous parts of the natural world are now explainable and comprehensible.  \n\tOne example of science clashing with religion is evolution.  The church has the view where everything was created by God with the creation stories in Genesis.  Science, in recent times, has provided more and more convincing evidence towards the idea of evolution, or the idea that organisms modified their very being over time to survive better in their environments.  The Catholic Church is becoming very dated its strict beliefs and understandings of the world.  The Church needs to begin to broaden its perspective as scientific evidence and new technology gives us a greater understanding and means to explain the word around us.\n\tThe Church needs to open up more to increased medical sophistication and medical technology, especially as it pertains to the preservation of human life.  If the Church truly has the mindset that God put us on the Earth to enjoy his creation then why not also accept the means he gave us to live by and enhance our own lives.  I think sometimes the Church forgets that God gave us our minds which support and create all these new ideas and scientific knowledge which can help mankind.\n\n\n",
        "      The Iraq war is without a doubt the most controversial topic on the news today.  There are many different subtopics to discuss within the subject itself, the two most common being whether the reasons for going into Iraq in the first place were justifiable and whether we should still be there.  Since the United States is already there, I don’t think it is worth it at this point in time to point fingers about who was right or wrong about going in.  However, it is relevant to discuss the option of pulling out.\n      I admit that I am undereducated on the subject from a political science perspective, but I have heard stories of what goes on over in Iraq from a primary source.  My friend was a marine who enlisted right before 9/11, so he was one of the first people to be sent over as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  He has shared with me numerous stories of his time spent in Baghdad as well as other cities.  One base he was stationed at the marines nicknamed Camp Incoming, because the base was under attack 24 hours a day.  One night at Camp Incoming, my friend remembers lying down outside with all of his gear on (in case of emergency) with the rain soaking through his inadequate raincoat, falling asleep to the sound of incoming mortars.  He told me that he didn’t really fall asleep as so much pass out from exhaustion, and imagined that what he felt “must be what it feels like to have AIDS.”\n      After listening to all of his stories, I can’t help but demanding a damn good reason for sending kids my age overseas to go through hell and possibly die thousands of miles from home.  At this point, pulling out of Iraq seems the appropriate thing to do. If we have created a mess, then we should attempt at cleaning it up.  However, cleaning up that mess is what we have spent months upon months trying to do, but to no measurable progress.  In my opinion, the war has gone on long enough, and we should stop trying to undertake impossible tasks and literally save the world before more of our brothers and sisters die as they are every single day.\n",

Considering that in doing this, the school saved the lives of its students, I think that their actions were completely justified. If the student wanted what they posted to be private, then they should have written it in a diary or a blog. By posting it in a bulletin, they were putting it out there for anyone to see and have access to. Considering sites such as MySpace and Facebook are used to find information on future employees and to use against many teens that go to court, it is no surprise that schools are jumping on the bandwagon to find information about their students. I do not think this was an invasion of privacy because when I think of privacy, I definitely do not think of MySpace. MySpace is a place where anyone can find out anything about you if you post it on your page and if a creepy old man can stalk teenage girls through it and that not be considered an invasion of privacy, then protecting students by using information posted on a MySpace should not be either. If there are things that you do not want people to know, then you should not put it where everyone can see it. On MySpace it is possible to post private blogs that can only be read by the creator of the page or certain friends chosen by the creator so it is almost as though he wanted to get caught. By posting a bulletin the student was basically sending out a letter to everyone who was on his friend list and I’m sure many of the people he is MySpace friends with are his classmates, and if one of them saw the post and it was something they were genuinely concerned about I am sure they would have said something to a parent or teacher just to be on the safe side. It is almost the fault of the student who posted the bulletin that the shooters were caught. Typically things like this are meant to be secret and a surprise attack, but by announcing the plan to the world, he took that away and he really has no one to blame but himself.\n      What I do think would be an invasion of privacy is going into a students locker or backpack or any other private item owned by the student. I know that lockers are technically school property, but I do consider going into a locker without a really good reason unfair and unlawful. I also do not agree with schools doing such things as bringing in drug sniffing dogs. I think that it is important that students feel safe while they are in school, but I also think that it is important that the administration does not violate the rights of the students. \n\n\n",
        "Subject 15- GENDER DISCRIMINATION:  Do you feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the present-day United States?  If so, what can we do to change this?  Do you feel that women are ever discriminated against, in the workplace or otherwise?  Do you feel that men are ever discriminated against, in the workplace or otherwise?\n\n\n\tI do feel that there is gender discrimination is still a problem, but not always only with women, though this is probably the bigger area of discrimination. I know that for many jobs, most people feel like they would rather work under a man who holds a high position, because the thought is, is that women can not handle that type of pressure. It they do somehow make it past the glass roof, then they must be extremely uptight and unfriendly, all of which are stereotypes of course. The glass roof however, does exist unfortunately. \n\tThe glass roof is a saying that is used to describe how most often women, are able to see the position in a job career that they would like and want, but are unable to reach and obtain it due to outside causes. These outside causes are mainly their other coworkers of boards of offices who elect those who are to receive raises and positions. Also, in the area of payment, women who are doing the same jobs as their coworkers who are men, often receive less payment. This is utterly unfair, because the jobs are the same, and perhaps the women has to actually work even harder just to prove her \"worth\" to the outside would and her company. Again, gender discrimination is not solely reserved for only the women, it can be against the men as well.\n\tIf a man was to go into sales in selling dresses, the assumption is that they must be gay, and if they are not then they do not know what they are talking about. However, there are many men out there who have great opinion on dresses or even how to make clothes for women who are straight, and yet it is usually harder for them to gain the respect that they deserve. Perhaps this is because women feel men who are gay think more like them and thus are telling the truth, or have them in mind when designing the clothes, and straight men do not. This is again a stereotype that must be corrected, because men who are straight have just as much ability to do women's work or design women's clothes as anyone else. \n\tAnother place where women are discriminated against would be in sports. Many women are extremely good at sports, but men do not hold their teams as in high a regards as they do men's. This is utterly ridiculous, because like at some colleges, the women's team might be first in their division, while the men's team are loosing horribly yet still get more fans. This is quite unfair, and women's teams should start to gain and obtain the respect that they deserve, because they practice just as hard as the men's teams do. \n\tOverall, I feel that there is still discrimination, but that it all depends what line of work or field you are in to determine if it is against women or men. People should learn to be more respectful of both genders in any field, and could perhaps even learn new things from the opposite sex if society just allows them to teach us. \n",
        "\tIt is ridiculous that gay marriage is such a controversial topic in the world we live in today.  With soldiers dying thousands of miles from home in Iraq as part of a war that the nation is divided on, and other domestic topics such as whether abortion is murder or not, whether two people of the same sex decide to get married should not be that major of a concern.  However, since it is such a popular topic, that means in some way that people should decide what their opinion is on whether or not gay marriage should be legalized.  \n\tIn my opinion, if two people of the same sex think getting married is the right thing to do to make them happy, then let them do it.  It doesn’t matter what anyone else’s opinion is, this is America – home of the free.  This country was built in order for people to escape the oppression of other governments.  As the poem “The New Colossus” engraved on the Statue of Liberty declares, America calls to the world, “Give me your tired, your poor, / your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. / Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, / I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”  When our country embraces such an ethic, it seems unfair to deny two people a simple right that is based on love.  If we do deny them this right, then America has lost its identity as a haven for the oppressed.\n      President George Bush’s call for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is simply ridiculous.  First of all, we should have learned our lesson when we tampered with the constitution during prohibition.  Since we had to go right back and amend the constitution just for the sake of declaring the prohibition amendment invalid, the simple moral of thinking through what is or is not important enough to amend the constitution should have been made clear. Also, the Declaration of Independence famously states the American citizen’s right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”  Now, I do not pretend to be a scholar of political science, but if there is an amendment to ban gay marriage, there would be some officially documented contradictions in Washington, specifically regarding the “pursuit of happiness” clause.\n      Lastly, the federal government should not only not be involved in the issue of gay marriage, but they should not even care about whether two gay people decide to be married.  That is a private decision between two people that should be respected by the government.  The government should only be involved so much as to determine whether or not gay married couples get the same benefits as heterosexual married couples.  However, if gay married couples were denied the same benefits from the government as heterosexual married couples, then that would count as discrimination.  Discrimination of any kind by the federal government is inappropriate, so by logic gay couples should receive the same rights. \n",
        "\tGender discrimination, although not as prevalent as it has been in the past, is still an issue in our society. In the past it was discrimination for very large issues, women were not allowed to vote, or hold a job. But there are also stereotypical beliefs held by both genders that are not completely extinct.\n\tWhen some men look at women all they see is “Suzie homemaker.” There is a stereotype of women that they belong in the kitchen, meant for nothing else then taking care of the house and the family. But this is not at all true. Women are just as capable as men to work and make money to support their families.\n\tHowever, there is discrimination in the workplace too. You have heard the story many times. A woman is at work and is not taken as seriously as the men that she works with. Even if she holds the same position as a male co-worker her education isn’t good enough, or her presentation couldn’t possibly be as good as a man’s work. Women have come such a long way. Although never faced with completely equal opportunities, our mothers and grandmothers took great strides in making life better for all women. It is now not unusual for women to work, as well as take care of a family. Women are powerful and can do anything they set their minds to. Women should be awarded all the same opportunities as men without restrictions.\n\tNot to be biased, men are faced with gender discriminations. Throughout history men have been referred to as the “bread winner” of the family, whose only job was to go to work and make the money. Taking care of family issues was not in the job description. However, times have changed. Now there are many men, who are referred to as “Mr. Mom”, taking care of the children, the housecleaning, and the family. Men as well as women can be in charge of these responsibilities. There shouldn’t be these stereotypes facing both genders that undermine what they want to do with their lives.\n\tMore then just work related stereotypes there are others facing both genders. Women are seen as the weaker gender, the gender that is not as capable as the men. Men are seen as the less emotional, less sensitive gender. Although in some cases these stereotypes are true, it is unfair to label all of one gender as having specific traits.\n\tSo what can we do about this problem? What can we do to change it? I don’t know if there is much we can do as an individual. For just one person to try and change discrimination would be a monumental task. But the power of a group is often underestimated. This is how women originally won the rights that they share now. Many women in the 1920’s were part of protests, picket lines, shouting “Votes for women.” They fought for their equal rights. The stereotypes we face now, although not a gigantic feat to overcome as winning the right to vote was, are still very important. Together if a group were to come together they would have a greater chance of getting something accomplished.\n",
        "\tFor me, gay marriage is a tough subject because I don’t really know how I stand on the issue. I was raised in a Christian home and have gone to church all my life, and homosexuality is very obviously against my religion and against what the Bible teaches. On the other hand, however, I have many good friends who are homosexual and I love them to death and would want them to be happy regardless of what I was taught to believe. So I guess I am stuck in the middle on this issue because I don’t agree or disagree with either side. Regarding the states that have legalized gay marriage, that decision is up to who ever is governor and if he legalizes it, then I see nothing wrong with that. The people who live in the state are the ones that elect these officials into office and they know beforehand where that person stands on gay marriage, therefore if a state decides to legalize it, that is their personal decision and since there is no country-wide law banning it, I don’t think that those living outside of the state have any grounds to argue. If you don’t agree with the laws of a state, then move or be an active participant in the next election so that your voice can be heard. \n\tIn my opinion Bush pushing for a constitution amendment banning gay marriage is relatively understandable. Being a republican and a conservative he obviously does not agree with gay marriage so the fact that he is trying to ban it is in no way surprising to me and should not be to anyone else. Considering that America was built on having faith in God, it makes sense that the laws of the country should reflect what is written in the Bible. However, since church and state has been separated, I do not know if that is a valid argument any longer. Overall, I do not think that the federal government should be involved in the issue because I think making a nation-wide law would do more harm then help. Also, but allowing each state to make their own decisions, it gives homosexuals hope to have a legally binding relationship with the person they love and also gives them a chance to experience what people in heterosexual relationships have experienced. \n\tFor me, this issue is not black and white and there is no right answer or wrong answer. I have been raised to believe one thing my entire life, and if you asked my parents or any of my church friends, they would say that gay marriage without a doubt should be illegal no questions asked, end of discussion. In all honesty, I don’t really agree with the homosexual lifestyle, but I do not judge people based on their sexual orientation. Regardless, everyone deserves the chance to be happy no matter whom they choose to love. Societal norms have changed greatly over the centuries, and it’s no surprise that they are going to continue to change, but before change happens, there is always controversy and conflict, but I guess that’s just part of the cycle.\n",
        "      This essay hopefully marks the last time I will ever need to argue about the War in Iraq.  Fortunately for me, everybody is beginning to agree with the point of view I have had since the start of the war.  Of course, this is unfortunate for our country, because if we had a legitimate reason for entering the country, and were fighting a just war, then we wouldn’t be the bad guys.  Unfortunately, we didn’t have a legitimate reason, and this war isn’t just.  Why did we enter in the first place?  I think the reasons the Bush administration have given: weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, Saddam as a threat to the world, have all been effectively ruled out.  Then what could it have been?  Oil?  Money?  Revenge?  It doesn’t really matter now.  Most of the world knows we were wrong, and most of the United States has accepted that, except unfortunately for the current administration, who of course are stubborn and stuck on staying in the country that we have no place being in.  Of course I feel like a hypocrite talking about the war, not ever having been in it, or even close to it.  Let me not then talk just of myself.  Recent polls have shown that 70% of our soldiers think we need to pull out within the year.  80% of Iraqis think we need to leave, and 2/3 of the world’s population agree.   If the people of the country we are trying to ‘help’ don’t want us there, then why in God’s name do we persist?  This can’t benefit us, with the number of American soldiers dying.  Perhaps a few businessmen and big businesses close to the Bush administration are benefiting, but that doesn’t really seem like a justifiable reason to stay.\n      But perhaps one shouldn’t just look at the negative aspects of our prolonged stay.  Maybe should look at all the good that has come from our occupation.  For example, look at all those kids growing up who really wanted to kill people and fire guns and all that fun stuff, but were always overwhelmed with a moral responsibility not to do so.  Well now all those masochistic oddballs have their chance! It’s not even illegal, and if they do a good enough job, they might get medals and tons of other benefits!  This is really a win-win situation, save for of course, the Iraqis they are killing.  But they are the enemy of course.  Well, except for all the innocent Iraqis they have been torturing and killing, at Haditha and Abu Ghraib and Ishaqi.  Oh and there’s that fourteen year old Iraqi girl that was raped and killed while her family was forced to watch.  But hey, isn’t it better for all those psychos to get their rage and their evil out on some other country than here in the United States?  And here’s another pro: look at it from the point of view of the terrorists.  What if after 9/11 the United States would have taken positive steps towards countering terrorism?  Then these poor terrorists wouldn’t have stood a chance, with the size of our military and all the nuclear weapons and high grade technology we have.  Now, because we’ve entered a country that really has no effect on the war on terror, Al Qaeda has a chance.  Recently discovered letters from Al Qaeda leaders actually claim that the longer the United States stays in Iraq, the more powerful Al Qaeda will become.  Yay!  I’m glad were doing so much to help terrorists.  However, some may be of the opinion that fostering terrorist organizations may be taking toleration a little too far.  I’ll leave that up to personal opinion, though.\n\n",
        "\tThe legalization of marijuana is a wonderful idea for a variety of reasons.  First of all, crime would drop dramatically.  In places like Amsterdam and Canada, where limited amounts of marijuana are legal, crime rates are extremely low.  Also, jails in our country would have more space for criminals more at fault then a person with a marijuana problem who is otherwise innocent.  Aside from these reasons, if marijuana were legal, the government could tax it and help our country move out of the economic secession we have fallen into over the past several years.\n\tMarijuana effects are very similar, if not less dangerous, than the effects of alcohol.  While marijuana has no scientifically proven negative side effects, the negative side effects of alcohol are numerous.  Also, many people I know would smoke marijuana and drive a car with full confidence but would never get behind the wheel after having a single drink.  If an intoxicating substance as dangerous as alcohol is fully legal after 18 or 21, marijuana should be as well.\n",
        "\tSaying that students have rights that need to be protected is like saying that the sky is blue. Young people have the same rights granted under the constitution that adults (in most cases anyway; drinking, voting, and some financial concerns being different). These rights aren’t shed at the schoolhouse gate, as one Supreme Court Justice noted. This doesn’t mean that administrators can’t take reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of the entire student body, though. \n\tAnother major issue of concern is that of the nature of the internet itself, which is one that American courts will be increasingly forced to confront in the next decade. Questions of whether the internet a completely public forum, how much personal information can be considered protected, as well as other issues related to copyright, fair use, and financial dealings all will need to answered more explicitly.\n\tIn this particular case, however, I think tat school administrators acted within reason. Myspace is an open forum. Placing information there is like tacking a note up on a billboard. To expect that someone out in Wichita can post information on it and that someone else in Bangladesh doesn’t have the right or the ability to access that information is ludicrous. The student who exposed his plans in such an obviously public place had it coming; to do something like that can only be labeled sheer stupidity. There are ways to post private information on the web that only one’s friends and other pre-approved persons can access, and Myspace is just not one of them. In fact, it is an internet phenomenon that encourages voyeurism, in every sense of the word. Parents should be glad that school administrators are checking out their kids myspace pages, and not forty-year-old pedophiles (and hope that administrators don’t fit both classifications...).\n\tThe line administrators should draw needs to make the medium of communication its primary focus. Posting on a public forum, announcing things in the lunchroom, and hanging banners in the hallway are all forms of communication that administrators can, and sometimes should, check. Writing in private online journal (which Myspace isn’t), sending e-mails to friends, and phoning other people are not acceptable forms for them to check. The difference lies in what can reasonably be considered a public form of communication. If I call down the hallway to my friend Bob, who’s at his locker, that I’ve contracted mono, syphilis, or something else I would reasonably want to keep to myself, then I can’t prevent others from hearing. But if I call Bob and explain it to him, then there’s no way another person has the right to overhear it. The same holds true for the internet, despite it being written down instead of spoken. If I go to an on-line forum and post, “I think I’m going to wake up tomorrow, eat breakfast, and then go slaughter sixteen people and several small dogs,” then of course I’m going to b arrested. That would be the equivalent of me shouting it at school football game. Common sense is always a must.\n",
        "\tI absolutely do not think this example was an invasion of privacy.  For one, myspace is a public website, and anyone can access information there.  Just because a school official saw information about a school shooting does not mean that the subject’s privacy was breached.  How can one even argue that is was a violation of privacy rights?  What should this official have done – just ignore the threatening information because it might violate the privacy rights of someone planning a school shooting?  This issue is plain common sense.  When people are in danger, privacy rights – nearly all civil rights – take a back seat.\n\tThe bigger issue here is the distinction between right and wrong.  When you come right down to it, that is what all decisions in today’s world should be based on.  The benefit of saving innocent lives from a troubled teenager greatly outweigh the possibly  violating the privacy rights of an individual.  We should be so lucky as Americans that we are free in so many ways.  Maybe having so much freedom and so many rights is not always a good thing.  \n      When an official utilizes information to prevent violence, many people get offended.  In any other country, everyone would be thankful that a school shooting had been prevented.  Not America.  Americans and American lawyers are always looking to score some easy money by suing others for ridiculous reasons.  Maybe that is what this individual is trying to do – claiming that his privacy rights were violated in order to hide the real issue.  He was wrong and he got caught.  End of story.\n      “Privacy rights” is a very loose definition.  I think that people in this day and age are too sensitive.  These “violations” are meant to protect people, not hurt them.  What’s the big deal if the authorities adapt to your actions and catch you doing something wrong.  If you’re wrong to begin with, then you should be caught.  I support the Patriot Act because it is designed to protect people.  It is not designed to be a modern-day version of big brother.  If school shooters, or terrorists, or what have you, have learned to utilize the internet, it is a logical progression for the authorities to utilize it as well.  It’s evolution.  One side adapts, and the other side follows.\n      What are the negative consequences to law-abiding citizens?  In short, nothing.  If you aren’t doing illegal things, then you are safe.  If you are doing illegal things, then you aren’t safe.  Only positive things can come from the authorities looking for dangerous signals.  Just look at the results.  Lives were saved from a school shooting because someone acted on information.\n      I can see phone tapping as a controversial subject, but accessing information on the internet?  Please.  The internet is a public place and is designed for the easy access and sharing of information.  I can’t understand how someone would think someone’s privacy rights are more important than people’s lives.  This is an example of the backwards way of thinking of many people in the United States today.\n",
        "\tThe Catholic Church has been around for a very, very long time, and has certainly seen its ups and downs.  At the beginning of this semester, one of my professors mentioned that we’d be learning about “Popes gone wild, or if you’ll have it, Renaissance papacy!”.  During the renaissance and immediately pre-Luther days, the church certainly saw its dark days.  I suppose that what it all comes down to is the integrity of the people in charge.  I mean, the church has done some great things in terms of humanitarian aid and human decency, and many of its fundamental messages are good.  Christianity (and Catholocism, as one of its sub-sects) has some fundamentally good messages at its heart.\n\tThe messages that we are supposed to take from the Bible center around human decency and improvement.  We are supposed to treat each other well, and care for each of our fellow human beings as if they are brothers and sisters.  However, these messages don’t always make it through.  Religion is the manner in which human beings go about answering questions that are essentially unanswerable (Who created us?  Why?  What is the meaning of our existence?  What happens after we die?).  People tend to become overly passionate when answering these questions, and even defensive about their “righteousness”.\n\tMany people pervert the essential Christian messages for their own ends.  For instance, the “religious right” which has begun to pervade the American political system.  They distract our politicians and citizens from important issues, such as globalization’s effects on human rights, the environmental consequences of our actions, and our coming energy crisis.  When these things hit us harder, people will probably be like “Hey wait, we should have done something about this when those asshole media-frenzied church people were complaining about gay marriage and abortion”.  Gay marriage and abortion are semi-important questions, but they don’t need to be fought as crusades.\n\tIn fact, I think Catholocism and Christianity are inherently un-political, and should be kept as such.  They are supposed to be implemented on a personal level – we are supposed to love our neighbors, treat people well, not steal, kill, or cheat, and in general, be kind.  We are supposed to focus on ourselves and our conduct, and are made to believe that if we do a good job then we will be eternally rewarded (the carrot, dangling from the stick, which draws people in).\n\tWith more relevance to the prompt, the pedophile priest phenomena was unfortunate for its victims, surely.  However, I’m glad that it finally knocked the Catholic church off its high-horse of infallible legitimacy.  The pedophilia allegations constitute chapter 2344687 in the book of “Horribly Evil Things Done By Clergy Since The Beginning of Recorded Time”, figuratively.\n\tSo basically, I don’t really want anything to do with the Catholic church, because when you devote yourself to a certain predetermined series of beliefs, you are limiting yourself from full comprehension of those other than your own.  Before anyone becomes a Catholic, they should first study Islam, Judaism, and other religions.  If they don’t, they are probably just sticking within their comfort zone and flocking to what they are comfortable with (namely, the religion which is most commonly expressed around them).  I hate it when people say “hey my religion is great, you are going to hell”.\n",
        "\tPersonally, I think cigarettes should be made illegal.  So why would I support the legal smoking of marijuana, which is even more harmful to the lungs?  People throw lawsuits left and right when asbestos is discovered in their workplace because they’re so afraid that if they breathe it in they’ll get cancer, and some of those same people smoke two packs a day.  If asbestos is illegal, cigarettes, along with their counterparts cigars, chewing tobacco, and joints, should be illegal as well by logic.\n\tThe argument is made that marijuana has effects similar to alcohol on the body, and if alcohol is legal then how can marijuana be outlawed?  The fact, however, remains that marijuana is significantly different from alcohol.  Alcohol such as red wine has been shown in small doses to be beneficial to the body by improving heart health.  Of course, like many drugs, if abused it can be extremely dangerous.  But the only beneficial effect of marijuana on the body is that it relieves pain - and so do lots of other drugs.  The harm of breathing in marijuana smoke far outweighs any benefits to be gained.  If you’re in pain, take Vicodin or a drug that won’t give you lung cancer 20 years later.\n\tAnother problem with Denver is the legalization of “small” amounts of marijuana.  How does one go about regulating marijuana?  There’s no proof system like for alcohol - batches of marijuana are mixed with different materials so that each has a different strength and composition.  And justifying its legality by saying it can only be purchased and used in small amounts is a pretty ineffective way of controlling its use.  Who’s to prevent people from purchasing multiple batches and using them all at once?  And does this mean that a legal marijuana content for the body will have to be established, like the BAC, to prevent people from driving under the influence?  I would like to hear how Denver plans on regulating the consumption of marijuana to keep it safe.\n\tPlus, although marijuana and alcohol are both addictive in certain situations, marijuana is known as a “gateway drug” while alcohol doesn’t usually lead to doing harder drugs.  Many people who smoke marijuana move on to harder drugs like cocaine as they build up a tolerance.  Allowing marijuana to be used legally could eventually lead to the legalization of other, more dangerous, drugs as well.  Once marijuana use becomes commonly accepted, the standards of what constitutes “drug abuse” will change and accept other drugs like cocaine for “limited” legal use.  Instead of relaxing our standards to accept more drugs, we should tighten them to include nicotine as a drug which should be made illegal.\n\tOne could argue that legalization of marijuana will make it safer for those who use it, because they don’t have to follow illegal routes to get it and the composition could be federally regulated.  It would eliminate some drug dealers and deaths due to contaminated drug batches.  The problem is, marijuana isn’t that much of a problem in those departments.  Marijuana dealers can be the kid sitting next to you in freshman English your first year of high school, and most times contaminated drug batches are an issue with more expensive and dangerous drugs that are cut with random materials.  Really, legalizing marijuana will do nothing more than give the police more of a headache in deciding what is legal and what is not, and cause more lung cancer and addiction.\n",
        "One of my big problems with marijuana being illegal is the complete hypocrisy of the fact that I am allowed to kill myself by smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol, or eating transfats, but I am not allowed to make the responsible, adult choice of smoking/eating/vaporizing marijuana. It is almost impossible to kill yourself by smoking pot as I'm sure we all know. Don't even get me started about the fact that marijuana doesn't cause the violent, aggressive behaviors that alcohol does.  Alcohol in general affects the mood more by jacking it up and then becoming a depressant.  The detrimental health effects from the smoke are much less than those from smoking cigarettes, but inhaling any smoke does cause problems. These problems can be minimized by eating or vaporizing though. I also think there is a major problem with it being classified the same as other drugs like cocaine, heroin, meth, etc. When kids are told that smoking pot will ruin their lives/make them crazy etc. and they realize that this doesn't happen, it illegitimizes the warning entirely, making it really easy to believe that since they were lied to about weed, then the adults must also be lying about the other drugs. It's really, really dangerous. The fact that its illegal also makes it somewhat easier for many kids to obtain than alcohol, since while many people would never sell to a child, many people don't care due to the profit potential. The illegality also creates so much unnecessary crime and violence that just wouldn't happen if it were legal. How many people sell their homebrewed moonshine for incredibly jacked up prices? Why not legitimize and tax its sale, using some of the tax money for real drug education and rehabilitation programs? The way it is now, our prisons are out of control and filled with nonviolent offenders and the only government money being made from marijuana is a result of corruption. And court fees and or fines.  By making it illegal, we also dramatically limit the amount of research that is done on its health and medical effects, whether they be positive or negative. Even though the federal law overrides the states that have medical marijuana programs, its still a positive step and I believe that if more states follow this trend, real results can happen. I'm not sure how I feel about the legalization of other drugs. I do think there are harmful drugs out there and of course there is a potential to abuse any substance really. I do know that what we are currently doing is NOT WORKING and that there are millions of lives ruined by both drug abuse-not marijuana-as well as the drug war's effects. The punishment should not exceed the crime, and in the case of marijuana, as well as some other drugs, this is certainly not the case.  The drug status of marijuana was in the very beginning yellow journalism.  William Randolph Hearst and other lumber heavy-hitters in the 20's gave hemp its \"evil\" makeover by redubbing it \"marijuana\" which gave it a foreign/exotic /unfamiliar/distrustful sound.\n",
        "      Recently, the city of Denver, Colorado has decided to make it legal for people over 21 to purchase small amounts of marijuana.  Personally, I do not feel that this is a good idea.  I do not have very strong reasons to back up this view, but basically I feel that the government should not be making it easier for its citizens to use drugs.  While marijuana has not been shown to be addictive, it is still a drug that impairs the body.  Like any other drug or alcohol, marijuana is certainly a drug that can be abused or overused.  \n\tAlthough Denver might legalize marijuana only in small amounts, once the city allows people to purchase the drug, they can not control what people do with it.  The government can decide that only people over 21 can use the marijuana, but surely it will get into the hands of people under 21.  In this regard the situation is similar to alcohol:  while alcohol is only legal for consumption or purchase by people over 21, people under 21 find a way to get alcohol.  Although marijuana is not legal in the United States (other than in Denver), people still smoke.  Just because it is against the law does not stop people from finding ways to obtain the drug, but I don’t think that the government should make it even easier for people to get marijuana.\n\tIn the United States, we already have a huge problem with people drinking and driving.   So many lives have been lost because people drive under the influence of alcohol.  Even though the punishment for drinking and driving is significant, people still do it anyway.  We have a hard enough time keeping our roads safe from people who drive drunk.  It doesn’t make sense that we would legalize marijuana, since this would just provide another way in which people can impair their senses.  We will just have the problem of people driving under the influence of marijuana, which could be just as dangerous as driving under the influence of alcohol.  Obviously, just since marijuana is not legal doesn’t mean that the road are free from people who are high, but by making marijuana legal, we would just be increasing the risk that there would be people on the road who will be endangering the lives of others.  \n\tAnother reason why I do not think that it makes sense for the city of Denver to legalize marijuana is because it seems very strange to me that a drug would be legal in only one city.  I really don’t see how it will be possibly to control the distribution of the marijuana.  If we think that we have a problem with drug trafficking now, I believe that it would get even worse if we made it legal in once city.  At least when it is not legal at all, the rules are cut and dry.  But by allowing marijuana to be sold in Denver makes things much more complicated.  How do you control whether a shipment truly makes it to Denver or if it goes somewhere else instead?  This all just seems very complicated to me and much more trouble than it is worth.  \n",
        "      Gender discrimination will always exist for the same reason any discrimination will always exist – people are different.  If someone is different from everybody else, that is an easy and obvious target for another person to put them down, regardless of what motivates the bully.  That being said, I believe that gender discrimination has come a long way in the past few decades.  Through the Women’s Rights movement and other similar activism, I think certain people have succeeded in convincing the American public as a whole treat everyone a little more fairly.  All that anyone can ask is that people be treated with respect in public, no matter what private opinions people hold.  So, while there will never be a complete eradication of gender discrimination in America, we are on the right track to making everyone treat each other with the most respect possible.\n      Women hold the short end of the stick as far as gender discrimination is concerned.  This is because the man has held a higher social status throughout history.  Even if we look back as recent as the early 1900’s, men were primarily the head of the household, holding the higher paying job.  Women were considered the homemakers, and if they even had a job at all their professions were limited to short list, such as teachers or nurses.  After the World Wars, when the men were sent off to war, women started to fill in for the positions that up until then were reserved for men.  This probably had a lot to do with women gaining more respect as a demographic, because it proved that most of the jobs done by men could also be done by women as well.  In present day, women have just as good a chance at getting a job as men do applying for the same position. However, there still remain fields of work that are statistically held primarily by men, such as engineering and some of the other fields of science.  This may be because women simply aren’t attracted to those jobs as much as they are to other jobs.  Whatever the cause, the lack of female employees in these lines of work still leave the door wide open for discrimination.  For example, since there are not many women scientists, one could make the faulty correlation that women don’t excel at subjects such as math or science as men do. Since there will never be an exact 50/50 ratio of men and women at all jobs, this type of reasoning for gender discrimination will always exist to some point.\n      Men can be discriminated against in the workplace to a lesser degree, but for different reasons.  As mentioned before, some occupations were classically held by women.  When men start to apply and work at these jobs, they can be viewed as feminine.  American culture as a whole unfortunately still holds the belief that men should be manly and macho.  Therefore, men who hold these jobs are open to a different brand of gender discrimination.\n      \n",
        "\tAlthough gender discrimination is not nearly as big an issue as it has been in the past, I do feel as though it is still an issue in the present-day United States. Women have really moved their way to the top in today’s society. They are able to do pretty much all of the same things as men, such as hold high positions in jobs, become pastors and ministers, and are not obligated to stay at home and raise the family and take care of the house. Although a lot of gender discrimination is not vocalized in such places as the work place and in politics, its presence is still there. In such situations when women are competing against men for positions, men are typically more likely to get the position. Also, when women do hold higher positions over men, the men beneath her do not always respect her the way they should and sometimes undermine her authority. We know that gender discrimination is still prevalent because of its role in the media. I have seen a number of episodes of shows that focus on the inequities women suffer from in the workplace and how they are sometimes disrespected because of their gender. I also have many male friends who are quick to come up with gender related jokes that are meant to make fun of women and say that they are inferior to men. Regardless of whether or not they really feel this way, such acts show that women are not seen as equal in today’s society no matter what laws are written. It may be the law to treat women the same as men, but there always seems to be that underlying feeling in the back of society’s mind that says that women are beneath men. I do not feel as though men are discriminated against in the workplace because they created the workplace and typically run the work place. Most people do not look at a man and think that a woman would be better qualified for a position simply because she is a woman, but that happens to women all the time. \nAnd then there is the whole debate as to whether or not we will ever see a woman president. It seems the only way this will ever be accomplished is if women band together to make it happen. I am sure that most men in this country would not be thrilled with a woman becoming president and it almost seems as though it may never happen. I would be thoroughly shocked if this happened within my lifetime solely based on the mentality of today’s society.  I think the only way to change the discrimination that still prevails in today’s society is to change the way we think altogether. Discrimination will never go away unless that mentality of women not being the same goes away. It is not enough to make laws saying that women have the same opportunities as men, but people have to make a conscious effort to look past gender and look at what a person bring to the table and is able to offer. \n",
        "\tThe opinion of people who want the Catholic Church to change according to life in the twenty first century is absolute absurdity. The Catholic Church has always been a target for criticism ever since Martin Luther, or even before him. The media currently loves to focus their attention on the Catholic Church, and all of its faults. It is most likely that everything the Catholic Church is facing is also happening in other religions, such as pedophilia, etc. If one selfishly changes a religion because he/she does not agree wholly with the views, then that person is not dedicated enough to that religion. If a religion is changed, then it is not that religion at all. Therefore, if the Catholic Church changes its ways to accommodate the twenty first century, it wouldn’t be the Catholic Church anymore.\n\n\tThere is always a reason for everything within Christianity. A female can not become a priest because the religion specifically said that they can not. The option of becoming a nun was created for women if they wanted to become that committed in the religion. Another ridiculous change would be to allow priests to marry. The priests can not marry, because all of their love is devoted to God. These things are parts of the Catholic religion, and will always be a part of it. Most people who want the Church to change aren’t even Catholic, or are selfish enough to solely stay away from church because they don’t agree with one thing. Normally this “thing” is sex before wedlock. If one stays away from the church because of that, then they should re-evaluate their faith. It is like if a man loves a woman who has a shaved head. If he truly loves her, then the male will stay with the woman. If the man tells the woman to grow hair with the threat of leaving her, then did he actually love her? The answer is no, the man was too selfish to stay with the “love” of his life. Even though the hair would have made her perfect for him, he took his selfish ways instead of his dedication.\n\n\tJust because the media only focuses on the Catholic Church does not mean that the pedophilia does not occur in other religions. The media is one of the only reasons that people dislike the Catholic Church. Every few weeks it seems as though there is another case on a Priest who has committed a crime, or the Pope who has done something debatable. I have noticed that those stories make headlines, whereas if an important person in another religion does something of the sort, it is not magnified as much. If these exaggerations of the Catholic Church’s “mistakes” cause people to form the opinion that the Church needs to change, then they should form another religion similar to the Catholic Church. This, of course, would not be a “true” religion because of the fact that it was not created as a result of some magnificent occurrence. The example for the Catholic Church is that Jesus came down to help everyone on earth. What basis would this reformed version of Catholicism have? The new religion by itself would not have anything to base itself upon other than the religion of Catholicism (a true religion) - not an occurrence, etc.. Changing the Catholic Church to suit modern wants is ridiculous due to the fact that a religion is not its true self unless its followers believe what they were intended to follow. \n",
        "Honestly, the War in Iraq has become old news. This idea of going into Iraq and hurting them for what they had to the Americans was good right after 9/11 when everyone’s emotions were going hay wire. But now its overdone. War in Iraq who? I do think that they should make a decision about if they are going to being the troops back to the U.S. I haven’t heard about anything constructive that they war is doing. \nI believe that the U.S. is trying to make Iraq a middle-eastern-U.S. they want them to establish a democracy just like us. I do remember hearing the U.S. give Iraq a time limit on coming up with a constitution. That I feel is wrong, I mean look how long it took for the U.S. to come up with our constitution. The U.S. is pressuring Iraq and trying to turn it into something its not. Although I don’t agree with the brutality, lack of education, and subordination of women in Iraq, the U.S. has got to realize that there are years of tradition there that they are trying to break down in just a few years. No one is going to give that up, that what how Iraq was established. I guess you can say I’m hoping for the best of both worlds. I do want the U.S. troops to come home because they are members of families that miss them and don’t want anymore of them to die but look what President Bush did. He went into an already unstable country and left it even more unstable, with no schools, and no resources. They also left a sense of fear in the Iraqis, you see on the news children with guns fighting for some cause, and even women carry guns. Although that was probably there before we got there, I feel that it has increased because of our appearance in Iraq.\nAlso with the removal of the troops comes more hatred towards the U.S., which scares me as a citizen. Moreover, I feel that the U.S. should stay in Iraq and develop some type of friendship or alliance between the two nations. Because I don’t want to see Iraq go down hill from here and I don’t want to see them to any more terrorist acts towards them. I have heard that Bush’s main worry is large amounts of oil that we would gain either by colonizing Iraq or by having an alliance with them. Once again I believe Bush has his own interests at heart, he needs to regain focus on the Iraqis and stop thinking so big. \n",
        "\tI personally believe that the possession and use of marijuana should be legal to certain extents.  I feel that age would be one limitation that they would need to place on it, just like alcohol.  It would only make sense considering both tobacco and alcohol have age restrictions.  Though the age would have to be debated about, there still needs to be some kind of limitations so that minors (who may be ignorant to its effects) are not allowed to get their hands on it and ruin themselves.\n\tMarijuana’s effects are very minimal compared to alcohol and are not nearly as dangerous and life threatening.  The only times the use of marijuana can become fatal are if the user has a serious heart problem or consumes up to 2 pounds of it.  The lethal dose of marijuana’s active ingredient (THC) is far unreachable even by some of the most frequent and avid of smokers.  Alcohol on the other hand can very quickly become fatal.  We have all heard about cases of someone giving themselves alcohol poisoning.  This can occur with a very minimal amount of alcohol or a very grand amount of alcohol depending on the tolerance of the user.  While in many situations like this the user can recover after a visit to the hospital and an unpleasant charcoal smoothie, sometimes this can turn into a fatal incident.  It is not often that you see someone sent to the emergency room for smoking too much marijuana.\n\tMarijuana also has much fewer inhibiting effects than alcohol does when ingested. Vision is not so much distorted and the person actually becomes more cautious and aware of their surroundings.  Those on a marijuana high do not overestimate their own abilities, but in fact have a tendency to believe that they are capable of doing less and therefore avoid situations such as driving or walking through a bad neighborhood.  Alcohol on the other hand helps to boost a person’s ego, making them feel invincible.  They believe that they can do anything, even drive.  This will cause them to make some of the bad decisions that someone who has just smoked marijuana would not.  While those who are drunken worry more about themselves and whether or not they are going to get laid that night, those who are high worry more about whether they made it back to the couch in time to catch the Animal Planet special on chimpanzees.\n\tWhile compared to alcohol, marijuana is virtually harmless.  It also has a lot fewer damaging effects on the body.  Alcohol can cause massive damage to the liver and brain.  While it can be argued that marijuana has negative effects on the lungs and brain, studies have started to show that marijuana use can prevent cancerous tumors in the lungs and can even stimulate brain cell growth.  Comparing the two cannot be a valid argument, however, because the only reason alcohol is legal is because of the fight against prohibition.  Though, it is apparent that marijuana is a much safer alternative and really doesn’t have much to argue against it.  As with the gay marriage situation, many people fight the legalization of marijuana because of their moral standpoint.\n",
        "\tThe recent legalization of small amounts of marijuana to users 21 years and older has certainly sparked much debate.  I believe that its effects are similar enough that it should be made legal.  There have been numerous tests and studies performed to assess the consequences of marijuana smoking versus cigarette smoking, and the differences between the two are not that great.  When compared with alcohol both, in moderation, provide a very similar obstacle to the senses.  \n\tThe fact that marijuana has been made legalized in small amounts seems legitimate enough because most of the harmful effects, like many other drugs, have been proven to exist after long-term, frequent use.  The fact of the matter is that any of these drugs are not extremely life-threatening or detrimental to one’s mental development when used in moderation.  In moderation the effects are minimal and can be contained.  With marijuana, however, as with any drug such as alcohol and cigarettes the effects increase exponentially under frequent, long-term use.  \n\tThe decision to make marijuana legal in small amounts could also help lower the crime-rate and keep the money for the product in the city’s economy (as opposed to the black market).  When a desired product is made legal it cuts the amount of black market deals and crime associated with the product.  This is so because it is no longer illegal to perform the actions so the desire can still be fulfilled without the illegal attribution.  Of course there will still be crime associated with the use and selling of marijuana just because it was not completely legalized, but a percentage will be cut out as those occasional and moderate users can be satisfied legally.  \t\n\tRecognizing the relative safety of the drug in moderation, Denver can also make a positive economic boost.  Since the sale of the good became legalized, the government can now associate taxes with the good and sales may increase since there is a greater ease of acquiring the marijuana.  While taxes may hinder some from the purchase as opposed to the black market purchases, I think it would prove better for the majority of those in the market.  Even with taxes, the actual purchase is much easier, convenient, and without legal risk.  \n\tThe only problem I see from legalizing the marijuana in small amounts is how they are actually controlling the amounts being sold to customers.  One customer, as I understand the situation, could theoretically obtain a small amount from several different retailers making a rather large portion for that individual.  This would cause a problem as the idea of moderation is pushed aside and the marijuana can cause serious brain and respiratory problems in the long run.  \n\tOverall, I think the city got the age right by not likening the substance to cigarettes, but rather alcohol.  I think the effects are much closer to alcohol, even those some of the health side effects are repeated with cigarettes.  As far as mind alteration, it would seem that marijuana and alcohol are closer.  My educated guess of the average age for marijuana users in the United States is probably about 18, so with a higher legal age, the government is still giving this choice for moderation to those more responsible for the usage.  \n\n",
        "\tThis issue of the student who posted a MySpace bulletin and claimed invasion of privacy has irked me since we first started discussing it.  What I don’t understand is perhaps simply about MySpace itself.  I have never been a member of this site, but I have been on it at various times in order to see a friend’s profile or perhaps to check out a music group that have their own page.  From that point of view, what I understand about the site is that it is very public.  Any person can view anyone’s profile and read their messages and blogs.  Now if this is truly the aim of the site, then I don’t understand how this can be considered an invasion of privacy in any way.  Writing that you’re going to kill someone and posting it on a website where anyone can freely read it is akin to walking out in the middle of the street and shouting the same thing.  If the intent of the writer was to keep something private, then why on earth would he post so that anybody and their mother could read it?  For me the majority of the argument of what is invasion of privacy is based on the intent of the “victim.”  Most people, for example, don’t want strangers walking around their house, or government officials looking through their things for no reason, thus we have laws against trespassing, breaking and entering, and unlawful entry for police officers.  This is the same reason that we have locks on our doors: because the house is a private place.\n\tNow most people understand that the home is a very private place and don’t disregard other’s privacy rights without understanding the consequences of their actions.  However, the internet is relatively uncharted terrain.  It’s hard legally to prove what is private and public on the internet, and what is infringement of privacy rights.  However, I don’t personally feel like there should be any grey area, and this is determined by what is viewable by the public.  If you are talking online in a chat group, then anyone is free to join that chat group and talk.  However, if you are having a one on one conversation on instant messenger, no normal person without any hacking abilities or tools could read your conversation besides the two of you.  So if someone does, that’s an invasion of privacy.  If you create a MySpace page that any member of the public can see, then viewing this page to potentially stop a crime is acceptable.  However, if one creates, let’s say, a facebook page, where privacy options allow the profile to only be shown to those whom the user chooses, then an ordinary person without these privileges would be invading one’s privacy by viewing their page.  Of course, however, if the page is shown to this person by a “friend” of yours on this program, then this is simply a case of trusting the wrong people, and since you did make your page public to this person, it is no invasion of privacy (legally) for this person to display it for the entire world to see.  This is the same as having a telephone conversation with another person.  It’s an invasion of privacy if without consent of either party someone else listens in.  However, if one of the two people having a telephone conversation turns around and informs the police of the entire conversation, there is no legal recourse.\n\n",
        "Subject Number 15\n\n1. WAR IN IRAQ:  The controversial war in Iraq has made news headlines almost every day since it began.  How do you feel about the war?  Do you think the war should continue or has it gone on long enough?\n\n\tI feel as if the war in Iraq has gone on long enough, though I do not see any graceful way out of the situation until its entire completion. We can simply not leave the country half done. Our efforts in organization then might be easily overthrown by the terrorists or groups that do not have all of the best interests in mind for the rest of country outside of their immediate group. We do not want to follow in the footsteps of Russia when they overtook Afghanistan and then just left half way through. The country was in great turmoil and was much worse off then before they were invaded originally. If we leave Iraq now, without following though, then all of our effort and blood shed would be in vain. \n\tOn the other hand, I feel as if there should be a faster way to end this war, or at least occupation of Iraq. I understand that we are allowing them to create their own government with us just monitoring them, yet do we really need to keep sending over more troops to oversea this monitoring? \n\tEvery day in the news we keep hearing stories of more soldiers shot or wounded, and it is quite clear that we are not wanted there. Again, I understand that we are at this point just aiding the military of the Iraq, and the police of the Iraq against the terrorists, but must we prolong our stay there for so long?\n\tIn the first place, we should not really even be here, because it was not even them that were linked to the terrorists groups that crashed into our twin towers. Osama Bin Laden was a harsh and cruel leader, but he was not really connected to our attack in any way. We used it as an excuse to attack his country, and capture him saying that he aided them and was harboring \"weapons of mass destruction,\" which was untrue. It was really our own government that was feeding us wrong information in order to have an excuse to go after personal endeavors and have an excuse for the rest of the united states people to back them up. \n\tI am ready for this war to finally end. I am ready for my friends in the military to come home, or not have to worry that they will eventually be sent over there, with a possibility to never return again. This war is drawing to a close, I know, but in my mind, this close is coming way too slowly. I hope that with our next election we will be able to have a president who is able to construct a clear and workable plan for exiting Iraq. I hope that this plan will be a safe and workable and cause worthy manner to justify our being over there and loosing so many lives. I hope that Iraq will appreciate the mess that we got into for them in the end and be our allies and not turn against us in the end. It would be awful to have a new country fully running after spending so many years there and investing so much of our effort into its soil to just have it turn around with its new government and destroy us.  \n",
        "\tI absolutely support the legalization of marijuana. The reality is, pot, in many ways, is no different from alcohol. In fact, it’s probably safer simply because you can’t kill yourself from overdosing, the way you can with alcohol and many other drugs. Certainly there are risks to using any drug, and there would have to be restrictions put upon activities such as driving, but allowing the use of a small amount of legalized pot would do the world no harm.\n\t I have a personal interest in marijuana being legalized. A majority of my close and lasting friendships, from high school through to college, began, or were nurtured, through a common bond: marijuana. I’ve met a lot of people after someone asks the question, “hey, want to smoke?” Some might consider this shallow, and my friendships \nunhealthy, but the reality is, I’ve never met a group of people as close as my friends. We’ve stuck together through break ups and people moving away, through college and \nfights. I can go to any of my close friends for advice on anything, and we can talk intelligently about sports, politics, philosophy, and a whole number of things. If given \nthe chance, we could certainly disprove many misconceptions people may have about youth who smoke marijuana. \n\t Marijuana should be legalized because its affects are similar, and probably milder, than those of alcohol. Marijuana cannot directly kill you, unlike alcohol. And \nalthough I have not personally driven stoned, many of my friends do so on a regular basis and have never once encountered any problems. Marijuana is a social drug, just like alcohol. My best friendships have been born from a common interest: smoking pot. All of us are attending major universities of repute, all of us excel in athletics or \nacademics, and none of us have ever been imprisoned or reprimanded for any sort of misbehavior. Marijuana, in moderate amounts, would be great for American society. We \nall need to loosen up a bit.\n",
        "\tGay marriage has become a strong issue in the United States today. Everyone seems to have an opinion on the issue. Personally, I believe that Gay marriage should be completely legalized in the United States. Some states have legalized this, where as some states want to completely ban it.\n\tCurrently, President Bush is trying to propose an amendment that will ban gay marriage. I think this is absolutely ridiculous. Who gives our government the right to say who we can and cannot marry? The only restriction that heterosexual couples have regarding marriage is the age: you must be 18. Why should homosexual couples be faced with any more restrictions? It is wrong to say that two people who are in love are not able to get married, no matter what their sexual preference is.\n\tThere are two people and they have fallen in love. They care about each other, and are looking to get married and start a family. They want a wedding to show their friends and family that they are devoted to each other and for legal reasons. Married couples have rights when it comes to legal issues for their spouse. These seem like pretty normal reasons to want to be married. So why does it matter if these people are men and women, men and men, or women and women?\n\tThere was a case in the news recently where a lesbian was in the hospital on life support. Her parents were there and so was her partner. Her parents wanted to end her life; they felt that she should not be living on life support. However, her partner knew that she would have wanted to try to live on machines, but because there was no legal tie between the two women, her partner had no rights. How is that fair?\n\tIn many cases homosexual couples are still able to adopt children. These family styles are becoming more and more common in our society. If a couple is allowed to have a child, why should they not be able to be married? No one stands in the way of heterosexual couples. Right now I could find a heterosexual partner and walk into a courthouse or a chapel in Las Vegas. With little difficulty I would be able to marry this heterosexual partner. But if I wanted a homosexual marriage, forget it. \n\tThere are such ridiculous views held by people in our country against homosexuality. Very few homosexuals are trying to push their views onto you; they would just like to be able to live their lives normally. \n\tStudies have been conducted that say being homosexual may be genetic. So how would you like it if you were born with brown hair (another genetic trait) and you were not able to get married? It doesn’t seem so fair when we look at it that way. \n\tPassing an amendment that would ban gay marriages seems like such a drastic move. Why should our country be so biased against citizens that are equal to us? In the United States we have the same rights; we have freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, the freedom of press. This should be no different. There should be nothing standing in the way of homosexual couples.\n",
        "Subject Number 15:\n\n3. PRIVACY RIGHTS:  Recently, school officials prevented a school shooting because one of the shooters posted a myspace bulletin.  Do you think this was an invasion of privacy?  Where should school officials draw the line as to whether or not they are invading privacy?\n\n\n\tI do not feel that school officials looking at a myspace bulletin or page is an invasion of privacy. I feel that anything posed on the internet without restrictions is fair game for anyone to see, including that of authoritative figureheads or even governmental officials.\n\tPeople post on pages that are visible to the public solely for the purpose of other people reading it. Sometimes I feel that it is a cry out for help, for those that are not strong enough to actually go out and do it in person. If a student was planning on showing up to school and shooting a bunch of people, but first posted this intension, I feel that he was one of these people asking for help. \n\tSometimes it is so hard to seek help that one will do anything to obtain it. Shooting would certainly cure the problem of not gaining any help, but someone who could talk to him before he actually shot and killed innocent lives would be even more beneficial, not only to the saved victims, but also to the shooter, because now he does not have to live the rest of his life in sorrow and morning. It is one less thing for him to have to talk about with remorse behind it. \n\tAs to where the line for school officials should be drawn, I feel that it is fair to say that if a student thinks that they have set into play a security action plan (or privacy settings) that they should be able to trust that. Those settings were put into place on the page or program for a reason, and that is to prevent others form seeing or reading what it is that they have written. They are not asking for help in this form or fashion, and so thus should be respected into what type of privacy they desire. \n\tWhat it really again boils down to, is that if you are asking for help, it will find its way out, but if you are just writing to write something down and relieve one's emotions, then ones should not need to further their emotions to the public or have to explain them. Privacy should be honored by all parties if a privacy setting is put into place.\n\tI am glad that the school officials were able to catch this potential school shooter before it actually happened though. I wish that they or someone was able to do the same thing at Virginia Tech last year. However, it is best to take the horrible situation that happened at Virginia Tech seriously and at the same time also learn form their mistakes. I know that had his initial privacy been invaded then he would be extremely upset and angry, however it is better a temper then an outright shooting. \n\tOverall, I feel that if you show signs, or needed to be watched for a little while for others and your own safety, it is ok to be invasive of private property. However, if you do not exhibit any traits then their should be no reason for school officials to just randomly investigate its students. \n",
        "\tThe Catholic Church has very old roots, and while it is important for it to remember its ancient beginnings, it also important for the Church to be an institution that is compatible with the lives of modern people.  This is good both for the people and the Church, for the people can find comfort and spirituality in a place that accepts their modern lifestyle, and the Church can attract followers by appealing to a variety of people.  Unfortunately, the modern Catholic Church does not live up to these ideals.  The Church is very often too traditional in its views, which means both that the religion appeals to less people, and that the Church is not reaching out to as many people as it could if the Church were more liberal.  \n\tWith the wide variety of lives people live in today’s world, a religion should be able to embrace them all and teach them spirituality and theology.  The Catholic Church, however, rejects many people from hearing the message it is trying to spread.  Homosexuals are not accepted in the Catholic faith, and neither are those who were not baptized Catholic.  The Catholic Church is so extreme in its views that it will refuse to marry a Catholic to a non-Catholic.  In a world where diversity is prominent and  inter-faith marriages are common, the traditionalist view that Catholics should only marry Catholics is outdated and intolerant.  For a Church whose message involves loving others, it is hypocritical to shut the Church doors at homosexuals and non-Catholics, among others.\n\tWithin the structure of the Church itself, the Catholic Church has many strict rules, which have been in existence for many years, but which do not fit into the context of modern society.  For example, women cannot become priests, and the men who do become priests are sworn to celibate, unmarried lives.  A life of religious teaching would be much more attractive to males if the requirements for being a priest were less stringent, because in a society where celibacy goes against the norm, the vow of celibacy means becoming substantially different from the rest of society.  If this rule were not so strict, more people would probably pursue the religious life, and the Church would grow and strengthen.  Priests would feel like they were sacrificing less, and be more content with their professions, and also probably be more likely to satisfy sexual desires through acts of pedophilia.  If women were allowed to become priests, again the Church would grow, and would be more consistent with the goal of gender equality that the modern society is trying to reach.\n\tThe Catholic Church has a lot to benefit by becoming more compatible with modern people.  It needs to loosen its strict rules if it wants to continue to be an attractive religion to people whose views are constantly being expanded and are learning the meaning of tolerance.  Over time, if the Catholic Church does not change, its extremely conservative views will lead a liberal society to think it intolerant and outdated.\n\n\n",
        "What does invading privacy even mean? Does it mean that school officials can look at your myspace page and they can ask you questions about it in school? Or is it just as simple as sitting in front of your computer screen reading a stranger’s face book wall? I think before one can judge when the school officials can invade someone’s privacy they must distinguish what is privacy? What’s private versus non private? What does invading mean? Frankly invading can mean something as serious as invading someone’s house or discreetly listening in on someone’s conversation.  \nPersonally I feel that invading privacy can be mix of all the things previously mentioned. In this case I feel that school officials are going to look at myspace and facebook regardless of whether they are in school or not because of them probably have on anyway. I believe that it is fine to look at a student’s facebook or myspace page as long as they don’t act on anything unless someone is in danger. Moreover I believe that this was an invasion of privacy. The school officials just stopped what potentially could have been a deadly school shooting. I think that where they should draw the line: on life and death situations. If students are just trying to express themselves in there own way then no I say the school officials should just leave the students alone. But when it comes down to innocent children dying as a result of some demented child who wants to take his personal problems out on people, then I would say that the school officials are allowed to take action here. When I was in high school, three girls where asked to withdraw because of pictures they posted on face book in they displayed girl-on-girl action in the school’s bathroom facilities. My high school was a girl’s catholic high school which some would think would give them reason to ask the girls to withdraw but I don’t think so. I believe that action between girls like the way they posed is totally normal. If you think about isn’t that a characteristic that is unique to girls; we are more friendly, more sexual with our friends than boys are. But I digress, the main point is that I believe in that instance the school was using the face that the internet is a big free-for-all to incriminate the girls. \nI feel that school officials should draw the line at life and death situations. They should not interfere with students and their natural want to express themselves. Although the internet isn’t the safest place to express their feelings; it still gives kids a place to say what’s on their minds and not bottle it up inside. \nHowever, kids need to realize that the places like myspace are open to the public. I think that they think because it has there name on it and they are the ones controlling it that they are the only ones looking at it, however naïve that may be. Kids should understand that the World Wide Web in public domain and anyone can read their “personal” business. \n\n",
        "      It’s difficult for someone of my limited knowledge to come to a decisive conclusion about the use of marijuana.  The nature and effects of alcohol are more frequently addressed and explained for public knowledge than those of other narcotics.  Before my first semester at Loyola started, I was required to complete a three hour course of alcohol education.  This course included several tests and surveys.  I was never informed about the possible damaging effects of marijuana, although I can say from experience that its illegal usage certainly rivals the illegal consumption of alcohol.  In the process of deciding on the legality of marijuana, it is helpful to examine the nature and the effects of other legal substances such as alcohol and cigarettes.  \n      Several scientific studies have proven that alcohol, when consumed in a moderate fashion, can be beneficial to one’s health.  Doctors have found that marijuana has certain health benefits as well.  It helps relieve pain for patients who suffer from such chronic diseases as multiple sclerosis.  Despite the advantages of medicinal use, I do not know of any positive effects that marijuana may have on a typical, relatively healthy person.  I do, however, remember reading an article in Time magazine about the detriments it poses to such a person’s health.  Marijuana can impair the cognitive memory and cause damage to short-term memory.  And of course, smoking in general, whether it is cigarettes or marijuana, harms the lungs.  \n      Cigarettes continue to be legal for those over a certain age even after years of research and countless studies have revealed their extremely harmful effects.  I will not list all of them here but the most detrimental to a smoker’s health is the high risk of developing lung cancer.  And in the worst cases, the cancer kills them.  Unlike alcohol, cigarettes posses no redeeming health benefits when consumed in moderation.  Marijuana shares this lack, so is it unfair that marijuana is illegal while smoking is not?\n      There are many who claim that the legalization of marijuana, according to strict distribution and consumption laws, would help to combat illegal drug trafficking.  This is a naïve viewpoint to take.  If the production and sale of marijuana is removed from the hands of drug traffickers (which will be a difficult task in itself), there are a myriad of other drugs for them to choose from.  The only way that the government has a chance of ending the trafficking of illegal drugs is to make all narcotics legal.\n      I can understand the reasons why people think that marijuana should not be illegal.  But I am not aware of any valid reasons why people think that marijuana should be legal.  The recreational use of marijuana offers not health benefits but definite health hazards.  Not only does marijuana threaten the health of the user, but its effects on the user may directly affect others in negative ways as well.\n\n\n\n",
        "      As a member of the Catholic Church, I do not feel that the church needs to change its ways to adapt to life in the 21st century. I disagree with the cases of pedophilia and agree that they do need to be addressed and dealt with. I do not think that these cases could have been prevented if the church changed or adapted its ways to the 21s century.  \n \tTo begin, I have been a member of my church since I was born. I went to a private grammar and private high school, both with churches on the property. There would be days that we would dress in our church attire and miss class to attend mass. From the 4th grade to the 12th grade (up until I came to Loyola) I was a member of my parish’s chorus. I was also a lector at the teenage mass on Sundays. Holidays were always a big deal in my family; our holiday dinners and gatherings would be planned around what mass we were going to. I would buy a new outfit to wear for Christmas and Easter, just so I look nice at mass. This is the church I know, I do not need it to change; I like it the way it is. I do not think the church should change because it was created this way and should stay the way it was created to be. I think that the 21st century has destroyed the image of the church and the mass. For my parish in particular, people no longer get “dressed up”, but sometimes come in their “beach” attire after a morning under the sun. People even walk into mass 20 minutes late-I just don’t see the point. People seem to have lost their respect for the sanctity of the church. \nI do not think that the cases of pedophilia could have been prevented. The church could not have known that these people would turn out to do such horrible things. If they did, then they were very wrong in trying to hide this information. I have no sympathy for any of these men that took advantage of boys using their power and situation. \n      I do not believe that priests should be allowed to marry nor should women be able to become priests. These ideas were not involved in the early days of the church-it would just be weird if it were to change. Like the example I gave in the emails with the show “7th Heaven”, seeing Lucy as a reverend seems strange to me. I am accustomed to seeing males as the priest or reverend figure. This may sound old fashion, I am 18 and not old fashion, but concerning the church, I like the things they way they are. \n      If I were immediately affected by the scandals in the church I do not think that my opinion would be any different. I do not think allowing women to become priests would have made a difference; women are just as capable as committing these acts, as are men. And the question for whether a priest should be allowed to get married, well married men have committed acts of pedophilia also. \n      The church has changed its ways, it has become more lenient, it has adapted. \n",
        "      Let me begin by saying that I believe war is a horrible thing, but it is sometimes unavoidable.  To say that we can live in a world without war is naïve.  There will always be those who are willing to use war to further their objectives, or to prevent something bigger down the road.  In the case of the United States and Iraq, we went to war because we had intelligence that strongly suggested that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction or the capacity to make them.  George Bush, and others, made the decision to remove this threat.  I believe it was the right decision.\n      It really is not our place to make an opinion on the political decisions of our leaders for the simple fact that we do not possess the entire picture like they do.  They are the ones who make educated decisions, not us.  I think we have to put our trust in our leaders.  George Bush is not out to take over the world – he just wants to be good at his job.\n      People will criticize Bush for the Iraq war, saying that it has gone on for too long, and that too many American lives were lost.  What if the United States had not gone to war, and Saddam decided to wipe Israel off the map with nuclear tipped missiles?  Or, a more likely scenario would be that Saddam would sell weapons of mass destruction to terrorists who would eventually use them in the United States.  Tens of thousands of lives would have been lost.  Then people would criticize Bush for not taking action.  You see, hindsight always has you coming out smelling like roses.\n      It is not our job to determine what the United States should do in the world arena.  We should leave it up to the CIA, NSA, and all the other agencies whose job it is to protect us.  They collect and analyze an enormous amount of intelligence and provide suggestions based on that intelligence.  We should let the experts do their jobs.\n      Since we have already begun the war, we cannot just pick up and leave now that it has gotten unpopular.  We have to train the Iraqi military and police force, and make sure they have the capacity to defend their nation.  Once the job is done, then we can leave.  \n      I know that a substantial amount of American soldiers have died as a result of the Iraq war.  Compared to other wars, however, the number of lives lost in the Iraq war is miniscule.  There have been losses in the thousands in the Iraq war.  In WWII, hundreds of thousands of American soldiers were killed.  I think it feels like its worse than it actually is because of the media and the way it likes to chronicle every life lost.\n      It’s not a matter of whether the war has “gone on long enough.”  Some wars just last longer than others.  The key is that the objectives must be completed, and as of yet, they have not.\n",
        "\tHow do I feel about the war? (Runs outside, yells incoherently at the top of his lungs for several minutes, comes back, sits down). Okay, better now. I’m against it. The United States went to war on false and shifting pretexts to satisfy the twisted policy notions of a foreign-relations-ignorant administration. Case the first: Saddam has ties to Al Queda. False. Case the second: Iraq is developing chemical and biological weapons along with various other WMD’s (all caps to increase the scariness quotient) which pose a huge threat to our country. False. Current Case: Saddam was just a really bad dude and it’s in everybody’s best interest to have him out of power. It was our job to do it since we’re the U.S., and are just generally awesome. Also false, but in a more complicated way.\n\tThis line of logic sets the U.S. up as an international police force which not only can intervene in anything, but is obligated to intervene in any kind of conflict. This might sound like a good idea to some people. The main problem is that it means we don’t necessarily intervene in other country’s best interests, but only what we perceive to be their best interests (which, coincidentally, we usually decide have to be in line with our interests). This line of thinking is only a step above the Bush Doctrine, known as that of “preemptive strike” in the general media. Essentially, this breaks down to mean that the U.S. has the right to attack other countries who may or may not pose a threat to it at a whim, regardless of the larger ramifications to whatever region of the world that country is situated in. The ramifications in Iraq so far have been widespread political, social, and economic instability and unrest. The idea of preemptive strike is probably the single worst foreign policy promulgated by an American administration in the last twenty-five years, or even the last half-century, if one makes a very large exception for the “domino theory” and its entire progeny of policies. It’s probably even a worse idea than that of “mutually assured destruction.” \n\t  The war has gone on long enough. The further back one steps from it, the more it looks like Vietnam (Oh no! Taboo analogy!). American troops are battling against a whole slew of splinter groups and radicals who only employ guerrilla tactics with which the military still has trouble contending. Many scholars have made the argument recently that Iraq is so radically destabilized right now because of the American presence. That isn’t just a pretext for “cutting and running,” as the swollen rhetoric of the Bush administration would label it (or at least until they have their next policy meeting and elect a new phrase-of-the-month). Much of the fighting in Iraq happening right now is the work of hyper-nationalist groups operating from one very basic premise: get the Americans out of here. If America pulled out now, the country would stay messy for quite sometime, but if America stays then it will be a mess for even longer. \n",
        "The Catholic Church most definitely has to adjust to the changes of the present day. Society was very different in the time of Jesus than it is now. Women now have rights and society places a heavier emphasis on different things and issues than the people of Jesus’ time did. I do not understand the why priests cannot marry. They say that they are supposed to be married to God and devote their life to God and his teachings. There is no reason why these men cannot have wives and families and still be faithful to God. I am sure that they now have other interests than God, such as a favorite sport or hobby. Is this taking away from their life with God? Not really. There is also no reason that women cannot be priest. In fact, there were even women priests and preachers in Jesus’ day. With all the rights that women have and all the equality that we have achieved should enable women to have the opportunity to be more than nuns. I think allowing priests to marry would have definitely helped to avoid most of the cases of pedophilia. Some men that are sick just go into the priesthood to hide their true identity and they are not even devoted to God. If they were allowed to have wives there wouldn’t be the problem of sexual tension that is arising today. Priests are humans too. I am not saying that sexual relations are necessary for life but I think having that significant other in your life is very important and not something that one should have to give up in order to be devoted to God and his teachings. I believe that God wants everyone to do the best that they can in all that they do and most importantly, to be happy. I think priests of today’s society would appreciate the fact that they have the option to have a family and not have to make that decision. I also believe that women priests would be a great asset to the Catholic Church, something new and refreshing. Some women may feel awkward repenting their sins to a man all the time. Maybe some would feel more comfortable talking to a woman. This might encourage more people to become active in the church and encourage women to further their faith. I know that I would feel much more comfortable talking to a woman about the things that I have done wrong. I feel like they are more nurturing and that they care more about how you feel than a man would. I feel like the men are just concerned about telling you what you have to do to make up for your sins. I don’t feel like they always just want to talk about things. I would also love to go to a mass that was done by a woman priest. That would be so new and so interesting. The catholic church has to find a happy medium where they can keep their tradition and also adapt to the constantly changing times. This will only help to better educate the people of today, by adapting to their way of life and relating to their day to day problems and concerns.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "      The war in Iraq is arguably the central focus of the United States’ foreign policy.  The government is expending many resources, including large sums of money and thousands of troops, for the sake of winning the Iraqi war.  The fact that the US is involved in this war influences the life of every single US citizen, and naturally, has been a cause of contention.  A person’s views on the war in Iraq can quickly associate him or her with a political party, because the war is so critical to American politics.  The war in Iraq is a major focus of American attention, and opinions on the United States’ role in it vary widely.  \n\tI feel that the United States is not making enough headway in its mission to continue the war in Iraq.  The majority of this problem stems from the fact that the United States’ mission in Iraq is unclearly defined.  It is easy to suggest possible goals, but the government has not done a good job of explicitly identifying the nation’s purpose in Iraq.  Daily, citizens like me wonder why the US government is so adamant about maintaining occupation of Iraq.  What is the government hoping to gain and accomplish?  If the American people had a clear, justified answer to this question, it would be much easier to support the war effort.  As it is, however, I cannot help but be opposed to something whose motive is so disguised.\n\tWithout a clear sense of the war’s purpose, the war just seems destructively harmful and excessive.  The United States puts so many resources into the war, and seems really invested in their cause, whatever it may be exactly.  Without knowing this cause, it seems wasteful to expend resources in such a manner, and even worse, to think of the lives that are being adversely affected because of the Iraqi war.  American soldiers are constantly being sent out to serve in Iraq, and many of them do not make it home alive.  Others return injured, or at the very best, physically healthy but having had endured the awful tragedy of war and destruction.  War undoubtedly takes a toll on the American people, not to mention on the Iraqi people.  Destruction and death are common problems in a nation at war, especially when the war is fought on the nation’s home territory, as is the case for the Iraqi people.  The presence of United States’ forces in Iraq only worsens the quality of life for the Iraqi people, to the point where they are living in constant fear of death and endangerment.\n\tThe detriments of the war in Iraq, for the US itself and for the Iraqi people are hard to justify without a clearly defined role and purpose of the United States in the war.  For this reason, the best course of action is to end the action in Iraq, for the war has gone on long enough, and it is time to replace destruction and death with peace and well-being.\n",
        "Privacy rights are a big issue in our nation today. Honestly, I am not sure why this is. I think it is because I am one of the norm. I am a white, catholic, American girl with absolutely nothing to hide. I do not believe that the government would ever want to invade my privacy. However, if they did, I trust my government enough to know that they must have had a valid reason for doing so and that it was for the betterment of the country, which I am all for, especially after the tragedy of September 11, 2001. My beliefs about privacy rights are as follows, if you do not trust your government to have valid reasoning for invading privacy, then you should leave. The government’s intention is only to protect you from potential danger or to keep you from endangering the country. This angers me so much when people do not agree with the government having access to some personal aspects of a citizens life. If you do not want the government invading your privacy, don’t do anything that would make them think that you’re going to endanger the country, that is not asking for much. The government has many other things to do and much more important things to do than to tap you phone call with you friend Jen about you plans for the weekend. What I am trying to say is that the government wont invade your privacy if you don’t give them a reason to. It is that simple. Like the school officials, that kid gave them a reason to suspect him of endangering the school and its students. I do believe that this was not an invasion of privacy because by putting that information on myspace, that kid no longer had any privacy. Myspace is a public network. I don’t believe anything on the internet is private. Invasion of privacy or not, the school officials made the right decision because they prevented a potential life threatening act. Who knows how many children and teachers could have been killed that day? Is this kids privacy really the top priority? I think that is ridiculous to even be thinking about that. I believe that the only reason the government should only invade privacy if they have reason to believe that that person is going to endanger themselves or someone else. I also think that I have these views because I am a part of the majority. If I was a teenage boy from Afghanistan I would probably have a different outlook on privacy rights. I think privacy rights and racial profiling however are two separate issues. And, unfortunately, because I was personally effected very much by September 11th, I do not have any problem with racial profiling. If it will promote the safety of our country then I do not have a problem with it. If they do not like it then they do not belong here. As harsh as that is, I do not believe that we should cater to anyone just because that would be abiding by their privacy rights. When it comes to national security, I believe that privacy rights do not matter at that point.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "\tThe Catholic Church is a very conservative and regressive organization when compared to other organizations and religions throughout the world.  They have an attitude of acting the way they want to act – disregarding the opinions of others, even those within the Church.  In today’s modern world the Church still has an empire of sorts.  Vatican City is but a shadow of the Holy Roman Empire, but it still shows that the Church is interested in temporal power, instead of just focusing on spirituality.  \n      The pope is supposed to be the leader of the Church.  I see the pope as a way for the Catholic Church to proclaim infallibility in all of its doctrines and teachings.  The pope is no better than any man off the street.  Why should he be the “voice of God on earth?”  I disagree with the highly structured organization of personnel the Church has come up with.  What power have priests been given that they can administer God’s forgiveness?  I believe each person should bypass the middleman/priest and converse directly with God.  The Church would not have this, however, because it would mean that they would have to amend some of their practices.\n      That’s one thing that the Church very rarely does.  They don’t like to admit that they’re wrong, because that would jeopardize everything they have proclaimed over the years.  Take their stance on homosexuality, for example.  They actually believe, in this day and age, that being gay is a sin.  This is why the Church needs to adapt to life in the 21st century.  Being gay is biological – it is not a result of the person in question choosing to be gay.  And so what if that person did choose to be gay?  People are different, so let them be the way they are without trying to say that God doesn’t approve.  This is just one example of how the Catholic Church breeds exclusivity.  \n      The Church refuses to modernize, even when science has made such great strides.  Scientists now have the capability to utilize embryonic stem cells to quite possibly cure some of the most deadly diseases.  It is ridiculous that the Church would say that scientists should not pursue embryonic stem cell research because it is “immoral.”  Who is the Church to decide what is and is not moral?  Oh, that’s right, God tells them everything that’s right and wrong in this world.\n      I still can’t figure out why Catholic priests aren’t allowed to marry.  It makes no economic sense to force the priests to be celibate.  In doing so, the undoubtedly reduce the amount of people who become priests.  I mean, how many people would willingly throw away their sex lives for some far-fetched explanation?  Not many, as the Church is figuring out.\n      I do think that the pedophilia scandal could have been prevented if priests were allowed to have sex.  It’s a fact of humanity that all people have sexual desires, and when outlets for those desires are stripped away, the priests turn to the easiest way around the restrictions.  It is the fault of the Church’s unwillingness to change that so many young boys were molested.  I’m not absolving the priests, but I guess they were kinda backed into a corner by the Catholic Church.\n",
        "What really is “gay marriage”?  It is a socially, governmentally, and religiously recognized marriage in which two people of the same sex live together as a family.  Many supportive of  same-sex marriage often use the term \"equal marriage\" to stress that they seek equality as opposed to special rights.  Opponents argue that equating same-sex and opposite-sex marriage changes the meaning of marriage and its traditions.  I feel that the suggestion of reserving the word \"marriage\" for religious contexts, and in civil and legal contexts using a uniform concept of civil unions is the best answer.  Does our declaration not say all men are created equal? So, why should same sex couples be denied the same rights as heterosexual couples?  I feel that civil unions between same sex couples should have identical legal status to a marriage, and partners gain all the same benefits and associated legal rights; ranging from tax exemptions and joint property rights, to next of kin status, and shared parenting responsibilities.  Those who advocate that marriage should be defined exclusively as the union of one man and one woman argue that heterosexual unions provide the procreative foundation of the family unit that is the chief social building block of civilization.  My issue with this argument is that then we should not allow couples that cannot have children to be married either.  Also, those who do not plan to have children should also not be allowed to be married.  The procreation argument cannot reasonably be used against same-sex marriage, particularly since technological advances allow gay couples to have their own related biological children.  Supporters also argue that making it available to more people would strengthen the institution of marriage, and furthermore that same-sex marriage would encourage gays and lesbians to settle down with one partner and raise families. Others argue that marriage no longer retains a procreative function of the government since many governments offer child tax credits and assistance regardless of marital status.\nThe example in our government of calling marriage an institution between a man and a woman infuriates me.  It is just a bit more proof of the fact that the separation between church and state no longer exists. The fact that our president called for an amendment banning even a civil union between same sex couples is appalling.  The president is the last person who should be allowing his religious opinions to cloud his judgment.  It is understandable that  gay marriage inspires its own set of passions, with opponents decrying it as a step that will undermine the very fabric of society while supporters posit it as an inevitable next stage in step-by-step acceptance of homosexuality by mainstream America.  But why, is that wrong?  Should we not accept our fellow man in all his many shapes and sizes.  If religiosity is the main contender against gay marriage, is it not true that most religions advocate acceptance and the matter of turning the other cheek.  My belief is that homosexual couples are no different from heterosexual couples and should be treated as such.  \n",
        "Subject 15-CATHOLIC CHURCH:  Do you feel the Catholic Church needs to change its ways to adapt to life in the 21st Century?  Regarding all of the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed? (ex. Allowing female priests, allowing priests to marry, etc.)\n\n\n\tI do feel that the Catholic Church needs to change. Being a catholic myself, I know that there are many problems that our religion faces (just like every religion faces...we just seem to get the press coverage for it). I know that there is a strikingly alarming decline in the number of people going into the priesthood. This is bad, because, while decants can give the mass and sermons, they are not really allowed to do Holy Communion. The reason why there in an increase in decants though and a decline in priest, is because priests can not get married and decants can. \n\tI know that in the past, as in years ago, back  in the Roman time, Popes and priest were corrupt and tended to neglect the church and only thought about their families and the money that they were making. It is for this reason, why a rule was made that priests and Popes, Bishops', etc, could not get married. However, I feel that times have drastically changed, that the church is not corrupt anymore, and that we will certainly be able to stop ourselves from going down that path again if it should arise. In Jesus' time, priest were allowed to be married, so I feel that we should have another try at it, and just be weary of our past to learn from it. \n\tMy allowing priests to marry, I believe that the number of cases of pedophilia will go down. The reason is because they will be able to have intercourse with their wives, and will not be tempted to find other ways to satisfy their natural bodily urges. The church does need to recognize that this is a huge problem though, rather then try and cover it up. By covering sex offenders up, it is only tainting our religion, and instead ruining it. Those who are offenders should be dealt with, and should no longer be allowed to practice in the priesthood. I hope, (though I can not be certain) that by allowing priest to marry, the number of offenders will go down. \n\tI also feel that women should be allowed into the priesthood. This would also help solve the problem of lack of priest, and would show that the church does view women as equals, when they say they do, and that we should all treat each other as equals. Women are allowed to become nuns, but nuns can only do so much, and are not allowed to give the mass. I see this as unfair, and should be open to women. \n\tAnother area that I feel that should be updated in the Catholic Church, is the idea that the Pope has the final say in everything. While I do like the fact that we have a unifying person to help decide across the world what our religion is about and to help follow certain guidelines and rules, I do not think he should have absolute power. I feel that it should be a democracy type setting if people tend to disagree with what he says, not of a lot of people, but of at least 30 or so people, so that there is enough variety of opinions to actually decide what is best for the church verses just one man's opinion. \n",
        "\tI am all for same sex marriage.  We live in a secular culture, we obey secular laws, and we do not reference the bible for every decision that we have to make in our lives.  But for some reason we as a culture are sitting back and allowing our president to use the bible as the reason why same sex marriages should not be allowed in our country.  I was a member of SAGABA in high school, which stands for the straight and gay and bisexual alliance, I met some of the most passionately in love men and women I know.  So what if they were in love with members of the same sex, love is love is love no matter what the sexual orientation is.  Does the idea of a man and a man living together really still scare our country?  The topic of homosexuality has been raised in the media, on our reality television shows, and even with our very own vice president.  When a show called the real world has seven cast members and every season at least one member is gay, doesn’t that say something about “the real world,” or at least how our society perceives it.  \tGay parents are perfectly capable of providing a safe and proper home for raising a child.  It is my belief that an adopted son or daughter can flourish just the same with same sex parents as he or she would in a traditional household.  If the love is real than the sexual preference should mean nothing.  Our President holds his high Christian morals in very high regard.  Undoubtedly growing up in Texas our president most likely had a slightly slanted impression of homosexuals.  I know I am stereotyping a state an to be honest just a region of our country in general, but its tough for a southerner to see eye to eye with per say somebody from California or Massachusetts.\t\n\tThere should in no way be a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.  The constitution lays the constructs on how to make our country a safe and efficiently run democracy.  It does not tell us who to marry or what is moral.  The constitution is not the bible and it does not contain “God’s word.”  Therefore our president needs to stop quoting the bible as his reason for being so opposed to same sex marriage.  I do not care one way or another if the bible describes marriage as between a man and a woman.  Not every American is Christian and not every American is straight.  If certain states want to ban gay marriage then legally there is no recourse to stop them.  On the same hand if a state, such as California wants to legalize gay marriage they too should be able to do so.  To make such a controversial issue with no clear cut conclusion into a federal law would be premature and unfair to a great percentage of accepting Americans.     \n",
        " People who say gender discrimination isn’t alive and well in our culture are dead wrong.  Have they never heard of the glass ceiling?  Sadly gender discrimination cuts both ways.  It’s aimed both at men and women in our day and age.  I think most people also aren’t sure what gender discrimination really is.  It can be something small, like a man assuming the only reason a woman is upset is PMS, or a woman making a statement making the excuse “its because he’s a man”.  Or it can be something much bigger like a difference in pay for two people doing the same job, with the only difference being their gender.  How does gender make you any different from others?  It shouldn’t even be a characteristic, which is counted.  As if gender is the only thing that could be wrong, or causing a problem.  Maybe the angry woman with “PMS” is just mean, and bitter and angry.  And maybe the man, who made the mistake, actually had a reason for it.  It even gets involved in careers.  There was a very prominent film a few years ago, “Meet the Parents”.  The father in this movie assumed that the main male character had become a nurse only because he couldn’t be a doctor.  The character had actually scored well above average on his entrance exams for medical school.  He made the decision to go into nursing, even though people always make the comment that it is a woman’s job.  Which brings up the point, why do we have these kinds of distinctions?  Is that not a form of gender discrimination in and of itself?  Anything one person can do, another can do, regardless of gender.  \nNow I’m not saying that restrictions should be lowered.  In some cases restrictions need to be strict.  Tests for firefighters should be the same for a woman as it is for a man.  This may mean there are fewer women in the field but the women who are there can actually do the job.  Restrictions and limits should be the same for women and man, sometimes restrictions are there for a reason.  \nAnother thing to talk about is the glass ceiling.  It seems in some gender dominated professions the opposite gender can only rise so high.  They then hit a barrier, which they cannot go through.  Others will be advanced ahead of them merely on the merit of gender.  Others will receive raises while their salary remains stagnant, again on the merit of gender.  It sounds suspiciously like racism.  How is it any different to discriminate by gender rather than race?  Simple answer: It isn’t.  It is the same as not allowing someone a seat on a bus due to their race, only this time it has been accepted for much longer.  Gender is not something which raises someone above another, men and women are different in many ways, but those ways complement each other, they should not battle against each other.  I’m not sure how the problem can be solved, but it certainly won’t happen immediately.  It will take some time.  \n",
        "\tThe states that have legalized gay marriage are more humane, and thus right on the issue.  It is not the business of any state, government, or otherwise to interfere with the loving relationship between two humans.  Governments were established in the best interest of the citizens and to ensure justice; since when did the governments make it their business to impede on the social and private lives of the citizens when it comes to what relationships they can or can not legally have.  \n\tScientifically speaking, it has been proven that men or women who are homosexual are born with this tendency or desire.  As far as this pertains to the church, if it is their belief that God is the creator of human life thus making it sacred, then there is further fault in their stance on gay marriage.  If God creates all humans, even the ones with homosexual tendencies as a part of their genealogical structure, then they too deserve the sacred bonds that God has made in marriage for his human creations.  \n\tAs far as the federal government’s involvement in the issue, it is completely and utterly wrong.  The government has no right to govern such a diverse country on religious issues.  When there are Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the same country, there is no justifiable way for them to back any law on a strictly conservative Christian stance.  Religion is certainly not a science and is extremely subjective in its interpretation, so for the government to use it as a means to support something like the banning of gay marriage is impractical and demoralizing to their credibility.\n\tThe way families are constructed in more recent history has changed a great deal, and this is just one more example of the Christian Church’s need to modernize.  Science has brought fourth evidence of a person’s genealogical structure that shows they have sexual preference encoded in their DNA.  It would suit the church best to respect the new findings of science and change their view accordingly.\n\tThe family can still flourish and the same love can evolve out of homosexual set of parents.  Adoption and new ways of creating offspring such as invitro fertilization or surrogate motherhood have made families possible for homosexual parents.  If they can legally create a family in one of the aforementioned manners and can still provide for the family in the same way heterosexual parents could, then certainly family life is no reason to ban gay marriage.  \n\tIf the problem with legalizing gay marriage has to do with Christian approval, then the state can call the bond something such as “civil bond.”  The government has no business tying its policies to religion in the first place, but if that is a thought that perhaps there should be a state-sanctioned name that grants the marriage as a legal action from the state or country, as opposed to a religion.  This route would ensure there remains a separation from church and state and gay marriage could flourish as an act of a free country and not a behind-the-times religion. \n",
        "      For the first time in the 230 year history of the United States of America, a woman is Speaker of the House (though the both the House and Senate are still mostly made up of men).  Condaleezza Rice is only the second female secretary of state in that same amount of time.  And of course a woman has never been President or Vice President.  If our government, the most powerful institution in the country, is still dominated by men, how can any U.S. citizen deny that gender discrimination is still a very real problem in American society?\n\tThe political arena is not the only career that lacks female representation.  When I was younger, and often thinking about becoming an astronaut or a Broadway star, my dad used to tell me, “just don’t think about becoming an engineer.”  Though said in jest, his comment was actually quite critical of his field for the way it treats women.  He made the observation of how difficult it was for women to acquire positions of power and responsibility.  In general, men still on average make more money per hour than women who do the same job.  A drastic example of this wage disparity is found in professional tennis, where the amount of prize money for men is much greater than the amount of prize money for women\n\tThe continued presence of gender discrimination against women in the workplace is a very real problem that still needs to be dealt with.  However, there other areas of life, it seems like gender discrimination has developed in the opposite direction.  I read an article in Time magazine last year about the disadvantages faced by boys in the American educational system.  If I read an article about gender discrimination fifteen, maybe even ten years ago, it would surely be about the disadvantages faced by young girls.  But it seems that in an attempt to correct the neglect directed towards these girls, school systems and individual teachers have overcompensated, becoming so focused on the girls that they no longer pay attention to the boys and their particular educational needs.  More boys, who often seek attention, become the class clowns.  The girls always performed much better academically in my elementary school.  If nothing else, the gender statistics on college attendance should be a great indication of some kind of gender discrimination.  Here at Loyola College, the population is at least 60% female.  \n\tIt is impossible to completely eradicate any kind of discrimination from American society, because there will always be at least one individual who makes judgments based on a person’s gender or their race.  But it is very possible to improve the situation further in the U.S., and the only way to do this is to first acknowledge that a problem still exists.  Then the government must work harder to enforce laws against discrimination and make harsher the punishments for breaking those laws.  When dealing with the educational system, the administration needs to more closely monitor the classroom methods of its teachers.\n",
        "\tThe United States’ involvement with Iraq, otherwise known as “the Iraq War,” is a controversial debate within the United States which I support. There are many things that people look at as they judge the leader of the United States’ decisions. The fact that a great amount of Americans do not like President George W. Bush has a huge affect on how it appears that all Americans view the war. Throughout my teenage years, I have been a leader within Boy Scouts. I know from experience that a leader can not go anywhere without the support of his people. I have made mistakes as a leader within Scouts, but these mistakes could have been solved easier if my “followers” would have cooperated with me. I feel as though President Bush is in the same position that I was in back then. It is true that he is not the United States’ best, smartest, etc. President, but he is our leader, and America needs to respect that. I believe strongly that if a leader is believed in by his/her people, he/she can do many great things. I support the war in Iraq due to my steadfast faith in our country’s leader, President Bush.\n\n\tAs I was surfing the internet on www.facebook.com, I found a group entitled “Thank God for Bush.” This group supported President Bush because he is our leader. I noticed that this group turned into a debate site about the war in Iraq which Bush is leading. Many people posted on the “wall” of the site their disbelief in the war, and their opinions on why it is pointless. In opposition to the protestors, one person posted on the wall a story of a child asking his father and mother, who were both soldiers, why the U.S. was at war. The father took the son to his window and told him to look outside and imagine that each yard in the neighborhood was a different country. Pretending that their yard was the United States and the boy was President Bush, the Father told his son to look out of the window and imagine that the man across the street was Sadaam Hussein. The father then told the boy to imagine that the man was throwing his family outside and beat them to death. The little boy wanted to call the police (U.N. in this case), but they would not help. As the man walked across the street to burn down the house of an elderly lady, he looked the boy straight in the eye. No one would help the boy when he wanted to get help, so the man across the street eventually ended up at the boy’s doorstep- stronger than ever. The point of this story, the father told his son, was that if he had stopped “Sadaam” before any of this happened he would’ve prevented all of the casualties. This story touched me and inspired me even further in my support for President Bush and his efforts in Iraq.\n\n\tAfter reading this moving story, all of my thoughts and feelings on the Iraq War became stronger. I knew that there is no point in starting something and not finishing it, especially something as serious as a war. As the story put the situation in the Middle East to perspective for me so that I could look at the world as though it was a neighborhood, I realized that all countries should look out for one another- no matter what the name of a country is. People should not only look out for specific countries, but instead look out for the benefit of all mankind. Everyone in this world should support all other humans, if their intentions are good. The United States’ war in Iraq has everything except bad intentions which is why I believe that Americans should believe in the United States’ efforts in the Middle East.\n#29\n\n",
        "I’m actually in the middle on this subject. I do believe that the Catholic Church does need to change it ways to be more accepting of all walks of life and not just some. Especially on topics like homosexuality and transgender relationships. Its hard for me to really listen to Catholic priests because I find them to be so superficial. Its like they say it’s a sin to do everything: to watch to much TV, to engage in sexual acts before marriage. I mean leave people alone its there life. Instead of trying to change people they need to look at themselves. Very few young people actually truly side Catholicism. It’s usually just a lot of old people. If the Catholic Church doesn’t get up to date with the teachings and they way they reach people they are going to lose a lot of young people to other religions or other harsher realities like drugs, and gang violence. \nThroughout my college career I have turned to God more than I ever have in my enter life. I went through a phase where I was fed up with the Bible, not necessarily God but of the teachings in the Bible. And that was because I had went to Catholic elementary school where the image I had of God was this domineering person who got mad at you when you did things wrong. And knowingly let bad things happen to you. Through college and with the help of my friends I have come to see God as friend, a non-judgmental friend. You can go to him when you have a problem and don’t have to worry about him yelling at you or belittling you. I can describe an experience in which I was I got in trouble at school and was about to receive serious consequences. I went into the Loyola Chapel and just cried and as I cried its like I felt a burden being lifted. I felt at that moment God was there taking in all of my sorrows and telling me to life my head up. Moreover, it was partly because of the Catholic Church that I felt that I couldn’t go to God and he wouldn’t accept me for all my flaws. \nMany people have said that there are Ten Commandments but one commandment is above everything else; to love each other as Jesus has loved you. If the Catholic Church turned to that commandment and began to teach about that commandment; about God’s undying love for each of us, I believe people would stop having such a negative attitude towards the Catholic Church.\nAs for their traditions of priests not being able to marry, well I believe they should keep it that way because of the reasoning behind it. Well I’m not sure of the theological reasoning but the reasoning I came up with is because it is in a human being’s nature to have sexual yearnings I believe that it is through Jesus that priests must pray to overcome that yearning. The sexual urge can be very strong so I believe that as priests continually turn to God to overcome that urge their bond becomes stronger.  \n\n\n",
        "\tGender discrimination is as much an issue today as racial discrimination, although it is not so negatively looked on.  Racial discrimination creates such responses as “What are you, some kind of racist?” or “That wasn’t funny, why would you say that?”  Gender discrimination is more commonly taken as a joke and so occurs much more frequently.  People talk all the time about how “the woman” shouldn’t be doing something physical or which requires a lot of strength, or make fun of women who take on traditionally male professions like mechanics or construction workers.  They say the woman wants to be a man, but nobody accepts that she chose the profession because it was just something that struck her personal interest.  In the same way, men who enter traditionally female professions like secretary or nurse are also made fun of for becoming effeminate, instead of respected for taking a job which requires a lot of hard work.\n\tI never noticed how much women are actually made to feel uncomfortable in the workplace until I started watching The Office, a comedy “documentary” series about life working in the sales office of a paper company.  All sorts of racist and sexist behavior that regularly occurs at much lower levels is exaggerated and brought out in the show, and because of the exaggeration it’s funny, but it makes you think.  If things like that never happened in the first place, there would be no basis for the show because it would be implausible.  Instead, people laugh because while the situations are so ridiculous, it is easy to see some of them happening in a real life workplace, or to identify them with a situation you or a coworker were once in.\n\tMen are also discriminated against in the workplace, but it is more on the basis of sexual orientation, age or race.  I can’t think of a situation where a middle class white male would ever really be discriminated against, unless he worked in an office run and populated by minority employees.  It is more of an issue when women are discriminated against than men, however, because men experience so much less discrimination on a regular basis.  Men can be denied from women’s clubs without an issue, but if an exclusively male organization is created you can be sure there are women somewhere protesting it.  While this is unfair and not the way to go about solving things, it is common practice in today’s society.\n\tIt is the responsibility of both women and men to resolve the issue of workplace discrimination.  Ground rules determining what is acceptable and what is not in the workplace have been set down, and punishments like sensitivity training put in place, that have been very effective.  Women should not have to “become” men, that is be cutthroat and ambitious, to get ahead in certain jobs.  Both sexes just have different ways of working and resolving work conflicts which should be respected.  Teambuilding exercises are a huge part of ending discrimination, but whether or not they work depends on the previous thoughts and views a worker had about people of the opposite sex.  Punishments should be stricter for repeated offenses, instead of just sensitivity training and perhaps an apology and a fine.  Companies tend to humor offensive employees way too much when they are high ranking on the management chain.  The problem needs to be cut off from above, and then lower level employees will see that their own behavior definitely will not be accepted and change.\n",
        "\tGender discrimination is not a huge issue in the present-day United States.  While it may have been a larger issue in the past half-century, it does not pose much of a problem to our society today.  In the modernized country we live in, which is the most ethnically spread country in the world, gender differences do not concern the common citizen.  Also, through my own experience, I have never witnessed a situation in which gender discrimination was evident. I have worked for the same company for three years, I have several women and men as bosses, and gender discrimination never occurred.\n\tWhether or not the common citizen of the United States today would consider gender discrimination a major issue, one fact always boggles me about the entire issue in general.  Men and women are inherently different. Therefore, it would make no sense if we were treated in exactly the same way. For instance, women do not typically play American football, as it is a very physical sport. Since there are a great number of differences between men and women, I would not call it discrimination to acknowledge those differences.\n",
        "\tI believe that gender discrimination is absolutely still an issue in the United States today. A few years back, I was writing a paper, and as research, I wad required to find the mean salaries for white men and white women. The difference was jarring: even though our higher academic institutions are now more female than male, white men still made an average of $10,000 more a year than white females ($40,000 to $30,000) the difference between black men and black women is also $10,000 dollars, $30,000 to $20,000). Thus, even though more women are getting degrees than men, it means that either men are making more for the same jobs, or that men are holding more higher paying jobs than women- and a quick glance into a corporate board room across the country will tell you that the latter is most definitely true. \n\tAnother area where it is easy to see gender discrimination against females is in the ongoing debate about whether or not Hilary Clinton has what it takes to be the next president. Almost every article is prefaced with the question “is America ready for a woman president?” There mere fact that this question has to be asked is a pretty glaring example of very blatant gender discrimination. The insinuation, of course, is that a woman brings something different, something perhaps inferior, to the table than a man does. \n\tOf course, discrimination can certainly swing both ways. There are certain professions that men still get strange looks for taking. You don’t see many male hairdressers, or many male nurses (the movie “Meet The Parents”) comes to mind when Robert DeNiro makes fun of Ben Stiller’s character for being a male nurse). If anyone admits to being a hairdresser or a male nurse, he’ll often be asked, well, why? And there’s always an underlying insinuation that maybe, he’s gay- which, of course, in our culture is emasculating.\n\t Gender discrimination is alive and well in America. It’s seen in the discrepancy in salaries between men and women, it’s seen in the popularity of men’s sports over women’s sports, and it’s seen in the fact that this country has not had, in 200 years, a single serious female candidate for president- even though many European countries have long since had female presidents or prime ministers. There are cases, too, of male discrimination, but the issue is much less serious, and often comes from jobs that are viewed as too “feminine.” \n\n",
        "      The debate over gay marriage is one of the most hot-button issues in today’s political discussions.  The underlying question is what defines marriage?  Is it simply a committed relationship between two people, or specifically between a man and a woman?  Massachusetts grants gay couples the right to marry.  Vermont allows them to enter into “civil unions”, and New Jersey is still deciding whether the acknowledgement of a gay couple should be referred to as marriage or simply civil union.  While I have not yet completely formed my own opinion about gay marriage, I do not believe that there should be a constitutional amendment banning it.  There are so many different definitions of family in today’s society that I wonder if it’s really right or even necessary to ban one specifically.  Furthermore, laws concerning marriage have typically been the responsibility of the individual states.  I do not see any need to change that policy.\n      Marriage as an institution that has taken quite a beating in the last few decades.  The divorce rate rises each year, and it is becoming more of a rarity to find two people in a loving, committed, and faithful relationship raising children together.  Since at least half of heterosexual couples seem to fail at this, why not allow gay couples the chance to succeed?  \n      There is also a great deal of legal questions to consider.  According to most laws in place now, gay people are not allowed spousal confidentiality during a trial.  This is only one example of the disadvantages that gay couples within the regulations of the legal system. \n      I can’t help but wonder if the opposition to gay marriage is merely a reincarnation of feelings that prompted people to oppose interracial marriages not too long ago.  There used to be very strict laws against white people marrying African Americans.  Even in the 1980’s, when my Caucasian aunt married a black man, they were not accepted at first by all the members of my family.  Today people view these laws as discriminatory and unjust.  Will the next generation view our laws against gay marriage as discriminatory and unjust?\n      The real question then is what takes significance, sex or love?  If two people love each other, if they want to be recognized as part of a committed relationship in the eyes of the state, to receive the same benefits as any married heterosexual couple, then I believe that they should be allowed this.  Of course family life is another important factor to consider.  Is it better for a child to grow up in home broken by heterosexual divorce, or a home warmed by the love of a gay couple?  True, children of homosexual couples may be ridiculed by their peers, but so were mulatto children decades ago.  After fighting one kind of prejudice for so many years, how can we so easily succumb to another one?\n      I believe that I have, through the course of this essay, convinced myself that marriage is a right that belongs to homosexuals as much as it does to heterosexuals.  There should be no national amendment banning it.  State by state, I believe people will come to accept gay couples, just as state by state, people began to lift laws against interracial marriage.\n      \n      \n      \n",
        "\tAlthough marijuana is a drug, it is a lot less potent than most and in my opinion, a lot less dangerous. In all honesty, it would probably be a lot less expensive and less trouble just to legalize marijuana. I don’t think what Denver did was a bad idea at all because by legalizing the drug and putting standards on it, they are actually giving themselves more power and minimizing crime. I personally think that smoking anything is a disgusting habit, but marijuana is so widely already used that it is not really a going to make much of a difference I don’t think. If anything, it’ll take some of the glamour away from it. Just because drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes is legal does not mean everyone is going to go out and do it, it’s just an option. Also, using marijuana is a lot less dangerous than drinking alcohol. You can’t overdose and die by smoking too much marijuana, whereas with alcohol, you can overdose and die by drinking too much. In my experience, I find that alcohol has much more dangerous and inhibiting effects than marijuana does. Legalizing other drugs would be a bad idea because they can and often do end in fatality, but smoking marijuana has about the same health risks as smoking cigarettes minus the mild hallucinogenic effects. If marijuana were sold in controlled environments like alcohol is, it would greatly reduce crime, and make the drug safer because you would not have to worry about what it was laced with. It would have a standard price and unit it was sold in and this would eliminate the possibility of being cheated out of your money. This would give the government the same monitoring capabilities as is has with alcohol. Obviously, driving under the influence of marijuana should still be punished much like alcohol is, but it would be a lot harder to prove and detect unless an accident occurred because that would warrant probable cause to test the driver. Regardless of whether or not marijuana is legalized, it is still going to be smoked by a large population of the Americans, so the government might as well cut their losses and legalize it. I don’t think it could get any worse by doing so, so really what is there to lose at this point? The war against legalizing marijuana has gone nowhere, and this country is in far too deep to eliminate it all together. At this point, that would be impossible because someone will find some way to smuggle it in or grow it, and the harder it becomes to get, the more expensive it becomes, and the more appealing it is to market because of all the money involved. The only way to end the madness is for the government to control the entire market and by doing this they will put many criminals and drug dealers out of business. This also frees up space in jail for those who were incarcerated for possession of marijuana and allow the police to focus on more serious crimes. Overall, I think this is the best solution. \n",
        "\tMarijuana usage and possession have been a big issue in our country since it was illegalized. In the 1970’s marijuana was used habitually by many individuals. Although it is illegal, there are many people who still illegally use and sell this drug.\n      Recently in the city of Denver, they have legalized the possession of marijuana in small amounts. I don’t think that this is a good idea. To legalize this drug, even in small amounts is giving the country permission to use it. This is not a good step for our country to be taking. I feel as though this drug is better off being illegal. The movie The Breakfast Club comes to mind, when John shouts out, “If he gets up, we’ll all get up!  It’ll be anarchy!” This movie, which centers on the life of delinquents in high school, shows some of these students smoking marijuana. This is part of what makes them the “bad kids” that they are. By legalizing marijuana, this task does not seem as bad. The world would be very different. The people of the 60’s and 70’s, who used marijuana heavily, would never have stopped. Our world could be much different as it is today. Picture how the prohibition of alcohol in the 1920’s changed the alcohol industry. If marijuana had never been illegalized, there would be many people under its influence today.\n      There is only one purpose for which marijuana should be legal. In the case of medicinal marijuana, it is possible that this drug can help patients of cancer get through the side effects of chemotherapy. It can also be used for other medical purposes. In this case, when marijuana is prescribed for a patient’s health care, I think that the usage of marijuana is ok.\n      An argument for the legalization of marijuana is that the effects of marijuana are similar to those of alcohol, why should alcohol be legal and not other drugs? Personally, I don’t feel that alcohol has the same effects as marijuana. I think that marijuana has a stronger effect in smaller amounts. It makes people act much differently, and it is harder to control when people are under the influence of this drug. In the case of the city of Denver, why legalize it at all if you are only going to legalize it in small amounts?\n      Marijuana is like any other drug, it is still used often by many people even though it is illegal. The same goes with underage drinking of alcohol, people who want to use it find ways to do so. It is important that our country keeps up with its regulation of these violations as well as they can. I have many friends who would love for marijuana to be legalized in the United States; however, personally I don’t think it should be. I don’t agree with the usage of marijuana, I don’t like the way it affects people and controls what they do and how they think. I think the country has made a smart decision by sticking with their law. \n",
        "\tCurrently, the issue of privacy has become a hot topic among people; there is one side that believes our privacy rights are being infringed upon, there are those that feel that we are being protected, and there are some that are not affected either way. In the issue of privacy concerning posts on myspace.com, I do not believe that the individual’s privacy rights were infringed upon.\n\tTo begin, the internet is not somewhere to post something an individual wants to keep private. The internet connects every person in the whole world; everyone has access to the internet twenty-four hours a day. The individual that posted a bulletin knew that other people would see this post. The individual may not have known that school officials would be looking, but it was there for the public. The school officials were looking out for the best interest of the school as a community. I believe that school officials should keep an eye on such “live posts” or “blogs” that appear on the internet. There are some people that cannot express themselves well, and will write something online that could indicate a problem of theirs. I would not call this incident an invasion of privacy. I would call this incident lucky, because the officials were able to prevent a tragic event that has affected many schools across the United States. \n\tI would consider something like this an invasion of privacy if it did not affect the school community. I do not believe that school officials should be intruding on the lives of their students. But students do have to realize that the internet is public- what they post can be seen by anyone; teachers, faculty, and school officials. My high school principle had a “myspace” page with plenty of students as his friends. Of course my principle had access to all of the student’s pictures, but he did not get a student in trouble for what he saw. The faculty heard stories in the hallways, they picked up notes, they saw pictures that were dropped, and they only intruded when necessary. The necessary was not most of the time. \n\tAn invasion of privacy cannot be considered an actual invasion if it is in the best interest of the people. I know that many people would disagree with this statement, especially with all the new practices since September 11th. If and only if my safety is the number one priority do I agree with these new security measures, but for no other reason. \n",
        "\tThe war in Iraq cannot be boiled down to 500 words.\n\tFirst of all, Americans as a whole are entirely out of touch with what’s going on in all of the Middle East, not just in Iraq, but in Israel, Palestine, Iran, Afghanastan, and the rest of the region.  There are a multitude of reasons for this, and at the end of the day, the problem remains: we are so isolated from the actual conflict that we have become desensitized to its human dimensions.\n\tThe political angle on this war is what soaks up all the news time, because that’s what is marketable, and what keeps people tuned in.  It’s an easy cop-out for news producers to run a story saying “yeah, more people died in Iraq today, this means President Bush sucks!”.  To use the war in Iraq as political leverage on Capital Hill is absolutely selfish.  Are we really so egocentric that the only context in which we will discuss Iraq is in its domestic political ramifications?  I’m sorry, but our domestic woes pale in comparison to those faced EVERY DAY by Iraqi citizens.\n\tWhen I was a small child, I was afraid of thunderstorms.  Loud banging noises, wind, rain, and flashes of light.  It was scary!  My mom used to say “It’s okay, its just angels bowling.”\n\tOkay, if I had been born in Iraq (which could have just as easily happened, babies have no control over where they were born), I would have been scared of things like cluster bombs, machine guns, suicide bombers, and corrupt police.  That’s scary shit for a four year old growing up in the world.  After getting their houses blown to shit in a war, what types of convictions will that child be stuck with for life?  Even if it wasn’t Americans who inflicted violence their neighborhoods, the American invasion essentially threw a match into the political “oil barrel” (ironic, no pun intended) that existed in Iraq.  Now, in the subsequent power vacuum, thousands still don’t have commodities like electricity or running water.\n      I was afraid of thunderstorms when I was little, and I can only imagine how I would have reacted to operation “Shock and Awe” (fucking terrible name for a military campaign, come on, the rest of the world looks at operation ‘Shock and Awe’ and passes us off as a bunch of cowboys who don’t care about anyone but ourselves).\n      As a further measure of just how retardedly and cripplingly out-of-touch Americans are, look at the video game “Call of Duty 4”.  The game play and graphics are great, I’ll admit that.  The game developer likely spent millions of development of the game play engine and graphics.\n      This game is basically “Iraq the video game”.  I believe the Army and Marine Corps literally released Iraq the video game recently also.  ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?\n      I’m scared the NSA will read this and be like “oh that college kid, we should keep an eye on him, he disagrees with contemporary political directions!”, but I know that probably won’t happen, so I’ll just keep typing.\n      Iraq the video game?  Is this the type of society we have become?  The closest that the average American will ever care to get to the SUFFERING in the middle east is a video game, where the first level consists of riding through the Iraqi country side in an Apache helicopter and blasting the shit out of the country side with a cannon.\n      Consider this: hypothetically, let’s just say a video game developer in Iraq made “America the Video Game”.  Let’s say this game was IDENTICAL to “Call of Duty 4” in every way, in terms of weapons, game play, shooting, and the like.  Only the first level would be a firebombing of Manhattan, instead of Iraq, and the defenseless soldiers who you are blowing up would be American, rather than generic-middle-eastern-looking wearing random turbans.\n      HOW WOULD AMERICANS REACT?  We’d declare war on Iraq and probably nuke it, because we are just that myopic and near-sighted.  We would take it as an assault on our national pride, which it would be.\n      Well then, by insulting the entire middle east with “call of duty 4”, we have just continued to dig ourselves into the shithole we have been sinking into for several years.  This country is so screwed, we need to SERIOUSLY start making friends around the world, or we are going to be in waayyyy over our heads.  If that happens, I’m moving to Canada.\n",
        "\tLooking on someone’s privacy within a public school system should be something that is not looked negatively upon if students’ lives are at danger. The fact that school officials prevented a school shooting due to the discovery of a myspace bulletin fills me with happiness. I have talked with public school teachers about safety in the school system, and they said that parents drop students off at school with the idea that the building is a 100% safe place. Some people may believe that the school system’s looking on myspace was an invasion of privacy for the student who was caught. I believe that if the school system has a legitimate excuse for “spying” on a student, such as saving lives, nothing is the matter with what they did as long as they are protecting their students. \n\n\tIf a person accuses the school system of spying on the student who was caught, then they need to look deeper into the actions of the student. As stated before, the student posted his intentions on a myspace page about  the potential shooting. When looking at what the student did, most individuals do not realize that what he did was an outcry of what he wanted to do to the public. “Bulletin,” as stated on www.dictionary.com, is defined as, “a brief account or statement, as of news or events, issued for the information of the public.” The key words to focus on in this definition are “for the information of the public.” No one would ever post anything on a bulletin, with the intentions of the public not seeing the display. The fact that myspace is on the internet- an area filled with networks with the sole purpose of communication- also shows how obvious the student’s outcry was. Since the purpose of an internet bulletin is for the public to view, I believe that the school system did not invade the student’s privacy. It is obvious that if someone posts something for everyone to see, even people who a person may not like may be able to see that post. The fact that the school system caught this message was nowhere near an invasion of privacy for the student. It was just as easy for the school officials to see the bulletin as a regular person could in their home. The Public School System educates the public and looks after their children during certain hours of the day. The School System did not invade the student’s privacy because, as indicated in the “public” portion of the name, the school has just as much of a right to view myspace profiles as anyone else in the community.\n\n\tThe line to draw for the Public School System in regards to privacy for its students should be clearly noted as a point where one student may endanger his/herself, other students, or the school at all. If a threat is not posed, then schools should not go online to look for things to accuse students of. If, however, a threat is posed, then the school needs to do its job by any means necessary to keep its students safe. If something is so obviously displayed to the point where School Officials can go on to the most popular website online and look it up, if the message is too private then the material should never have been entered to the website in the first place. Since the school in this prevention of the shooting helped save lives, then that’s all that should be talked about. Saving lives and safety in general has and will always be a bigger concern than an invasion of privacy within schools and around the country.\n\n29\n\n",
        "\tAs with any institution that’s been around for a millennium or so, the Catholic Church is inherently resistant to change. That’s a nicer way of saying “conservative.” Because of this, it’s acquired the outward semblance of a frat, a good ol’ boys organization. The hierarchy has the power and money to preserve itself by any means necessary, and frequently the means involves covering up the less tasteful deeds of its rank and file members. A similar principle operates in political machines. That’s not to say that the Church hasn’t done and doesn’t continue to do a great deal of good in the world; rather, that the insular character of the Church as an organization can sometimes promote systems of abuse which remain carefully hidden. \n\tAsking the Church to adapt to life in the 21st century, though, is a little like asking a duck-billed platypus to fly the space shuttle. The theological character of the Church is at odds with many aspects of modern life on basic points. Ladies and gentlemen of the court, I present for your edification exhibit A: The Church’s attitude toward homosexuals, or “inherently disordered persons,” as they’ve quaintly come to term them. Most people have come to accept homosexuality as part of everyday life in the 21st century world.  The Catholic Church, however, insists upon seeing it as either the product of bad parenting (often in bizarrely Freudian terms), an “accident” in the gene pool, or just straightforward perversion. While most advocates for gay rights these days do indeed argue that it’s genetic, none of them would apply “accident” as the nominal word of choice. \n\tThe Church’s views on women, after having had years of spit and polish applied, still look musty in a modern context, too. It’s hierarchy is of a doggedly paternalistic bend. Certainly, there have been many famous nuns and female lay members (Mother Theresa and Dorothy Day, for examples), but these women have wielded little power in the actual operation of the Church. This seems odd, especially in view of the fact that Catholic dogma reiterates repeatedly the idea that men and women were made for each other. If that were so, why are there no female priests? It would seem to lend a good deal more balance to the picture. Maybe balance isn’t the end goal, but I can’t conceive of what else it might be, and it certainly isn’t pedophilia.\n\tMarriage itself has been a big point of contention with and within the Church for some time now. Priestly marriage was initially banned because social views on inheritance complicated things for Church landholdings; priests with children often tried to bequeath the land to their offspring. This seems like a remarkably un-theological reason for enforced celibacy. These days, it isn’t as though a way around that contingency couldn’t be found with some creativity. Protestant ministers and others have been “ministering to their flocks” for centuries while keeping families at home, and this doesn’t seem to have caused any widespread detriment. But the Church likes to remain static, and so we’ve seen no motion toward the idea of a married priesthood, although, from a sociological standpoint, this would have a good deal of beneficial impact.  \n",
        "In the terrorist attack of 2001, I lost many close friends and relatives. I live right outside the city so I was affected greatly. When this first happened I was in eighth grade and even at that age, I developed a prejudice against middle eastern people. I could not stand the sight of them. I got chills when I watched the news and the re-runs of what happened that day. When I first witnessed the attacks on the towers, the first thing that popped into my mind was war. I wanted to get revenge on the terrorists so badly. I can only imagine what President Bush thought that day. His people were attacked and killed that day for no reason. Of course he was mad, upset, angry and distraught. I think President Bush had the hardest job of all that day and they days after the attacks. My first decision, as his, would have been to go to war. Although this was a rash and irrational decision, I think it was necessary at the time. We could not just let the terrorists kill our friends and relatives and just stand there and watch. Something had to be done as a response to what they did. We had to at least try and stop them. President Bush’s only mistake, I think, was how long we ended up staying in and occupying Iraq. I think by staying in Iraq we are only killing more of our men and women and we are getting nothing done. And, what we have done, will fall apart the second we leave. Those people are just not able to function in a normal society. If they cannot get along with and work with each other, how are we supposed to organize rules and laws so that they can live in peace? I think the men of the middle east are the most ungrateful people. By occupying Iraq further, we are not making any progress. All we can do now is protect ourselves because we know that they will always be a threat because they hate the United States. Because I was affected so greatly that day, it is still hard for me to look at middle eastern people not be disturbed, scared, or angry. I think it is in our best interest to pull out of Iraq and try not to deal with them at all. As the war has shown, there is not much that we can do that will stay in place. If they cannot get along with each other, I don’t think anyone can expect President Bush to solve all of their internal problems. All he can do now is protect out country with all that he can. I think the men and women that are stationed in Iraq should return home and we should heighten security instead of trying to solve Iraq’s problems. I think that the government should focus on the United States’ gaps in security and problems. This is all that we can do. President Bush cannot create miracles.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "      Privacy is a right that many people in America feel belongs to them.  Unfortunately, the Bill of Rights has no provision for a right to privacy.  Privacy is something that many American citizens assume belongs to them, but in fact, privacy is not protected under the law, and is not considered a fundamental right in the Bill of Rights.  While it may be unethical to invade privacy in some situations, there are certain cases in which invasion of privacy is necessary to maintain the safety and security of American citizens.  In matters of national security, it is perfectly acceptable to invade privacy to explore a potential threat to the people of the American nation.\n\tThere is much debate over what is an acceptable invasion of privacy and what is not.  Any invasion of privacy for the purpose of exploring a possibly subversive act is acceptable because it is done with good intent, for the well-being of people.  Invasions of privacy that do not involve a serious matter should not go on. It is unethical to invade a person’s privacy without good reason, and the only good reason is if that person is suspected to be hiding something that could possibly harm others.  Privacy is a courtesy that others should be afforded when possible, but it is perfectly fine to invade it when necessary for the protection of others.\n\tWithout necessary invasions of property, it is possible for things to go awry and for major consequences to result.  Serious damage can be caused by threats that go unchecked and blossom into events that endanger human lives and prosperity.  Every day, countless subversive acts are prevented, thanks to the people who work in the field of national security.  Much of this national security work involves recording phone conversations, tracking emails, and investigating suspicious activity, any of which could be construed as an invasion of privacy.  Without these invasions of privacy, however, our nation would be subject to extremist plots and harmful attacks.  It is far better to invade some people’s privacy than to risk the safety and well-being of an entire nation.  Those who wish to maintain privacy rights unconditionally need to realize that their request comes at a cost of human lives.\n",
        "Participant #14 Essay #5 – Catholic Church\n\tLuckily, I have experienced life up until my college life with minimal to no influence from the Catholic Church.  My father is a minister in a small denomination of Christianity referred to as the Church of the Brethren, which is a completely different view of Christianity than Catholicism.  If I still retained my beliefs in religion or God that I did until about high school, my father’s church is most definitely the church I would stick with.  It’s a church that altogether practices much more to the example of Jesus Christ than Catholicism, which seems to me more like charades and motions then actual spirituality.  The Church of the Brethren is also historically a peace church and a church that stresses simple living (so that others may “simply live,” as their motto goes), most truly to Jesus’ example.  However, over the years I have been more than disillusioned to religion, and hold a different stance denying the need for religion altogether.  Personally, I feel that if one does believe in a higher power, one does not need a religion to hold a personal relationship with this higher power, and what is a church then, other than a series of rituals and “incantations” that just denies the ability of humans to individually know and love their God?  Surely, the morality of religion is necessary, but that this morality must be explained as rules from a higher power that must be followed in order to ensure our place in a decent afterlife seems unnecessary.\n\tHowever I may view the necessity of religion, while religion is here to stay I don’t view it as an evil at all.  In fact, I think that for a majority of people, religion has been helpful and I don’t feel the need at all to abolish it.  While I might not like the concept, I am entirely open to letting whoever wants to try religion out for size a fair chance.  Toleration and freedom of religion are very important to me, and just as I allow homosexuals, women and minorities the same rights, I allow freedom of religion.  Now while all the may seem like a tangential dissertation on religion in general and not entirely related to the question, this is my very point.  Do I think the Catholic Church needs to change?  Absolutely not.  If the church changed the opinions it has held for the last couple thousands of years, then it wouldn’t be the same church.  That’s why we have freedom of religion.  If the Catholics changed their beliefs then they would be Lutherans, or Protestants, or Calvinists.  If one does not agree with the religion of which they are currently a member, then they can find a church that agrees with their morals.  The only problem I have is that so many Catholics believe that Catholicism is the only way to get saved.  When asked about Christianity, almost every Catholic I know refers to Christianity and Catholicism synonymously.  It seems as if the bishops and the pope believe they are simply better than other denominations.  While certainly each denomination believes it is the best and truest form, most other denominations I have witnessed believe in cooperation because their disagreements are minor.  However, it seems to me like Catholics don’t even consider other churches as valid, so if I would change anything, that would be it.\n\n",
        "\tThe war in Iraq has been a major issue since the time I was in the 8th grade, after the collapse and attack on the World Trade Center. When I first heard about the incident, I didn’t know that it was a terror attack nor did I know what the World Trade Center was. All I knew was that something happened in the city, and kids were being taken out of school early. I arrived home and the attack was all over the news. I kept seeing the word “war” on the screen; it made me nervous. I had studied about wars in school and thought to myself how lucky we were to not be in a war and how lucky I was to never have had to experience a war. All of a sudden, we were in a war. This kind of war seemed scarier to me though. It was a war not being fought on our battlefields between men who hopefully wanted to be there, but a war on innocent individuals who could not have seen it coming. \n\tOn September 10th, I had travel basketball try-outs with my coach from the previous year, Coach Farrell. Mr. Lynch was Katie’s father, a girl that I had been in school with since kindergarten; we weren’t close friends, but we played sports together. The first try out had ended and he gathered us all around him. I do not remember exactly what he said to us, I can still remember his smile and how happy he was to see us all back on the basketball court. He had a way of encouraging us to do our best, he never made us feel that we could not succeed; he was stern, but never mean. It never mattered if we lost as long as we did our best. Mr. Lynch was a great man who loved his family, his friends, and teaching others a game that he had loved as a child. I may not remember what he said to us after practice, but as we were leaving he said, “See you tomorrow girls!” That was the last time I would ever see Mr. Lynch. His office was located in one of the World Trade Center buildings. They had found an intact check he had written that morning among the rubble; the Lynch family has that check. I do not remember seeing Katie that day, I remember her mother speaking at his funeral, telling us that Farrell lived a good life and would not want us to dwell on his death, but to move on. Mrs. Lynch brought a note card that he had left for her on her dresser before he left for a business trip one week. She read the note card and began to cry. Mrs. Lynch was a strong woman but not that strong. There were 22 people in my parish that had died from the collapse of the towers. These 22 people all left behind families and children. Mr. Lynch’s brother had also died in this tragedy. \n\tBecause of this memory, I do not feel that the war has gone on long enough. I believe that our troops are doing a good job in Iraq, and we should be commending them, we should be supporting them, we should not be questioning whether we want them home or not. They are protecting the thousands of innocent people, like Mr. Lynch, who died for no good reason. Why that day? Why those people? Why those buildings?\n\tI think that war is an awful thing. I wish mankind was more peaceful and never had to go to war, but that is a dream and will never be. So for now, let’s pray for our troops and pray for each other that nothing like this will ever happen again. \n",
        "      Some states have legalized gay marriage, but other states have not.  This issue is a big one in the United States.  I do not real feel that either side is right or wrong.  This issue is one which is so personal, that I can not really determine how I feel about it.  At the risk of sounding self-centered, I will say this anyway:  since I am not homosexual, this issue has not really been one that is in the forefront of my mind.  I am not going to be directly affected by laws which legalize or ban gay marriage.  To me, it doesn’t really make much of a difference whether or not gay marriage is legalized.  If homosexual couples want to enter into a legal bound relationship such as marriage, just as heterosexual couples do, then I can’t really see that it is right to prevent this from happening.  Who are we to tell two people who are in love and want to spend the rest of their lives together that they are not allowed to get married?   On the other hand, marriage is traditionally thought of as a sacred bond between a man and a woman.  \n      To help decipher how I feel about gay marriage, I will first go to the root – the idea of marriage itself.  In this day and age, when it is becoming more common for couples to live together and to raise families without ever getting married, we must ask why people get married.  If you can live together and have a family without being married, then why do it?  My answer is that when you marry someone, regardless of all of the legal aspects of marriage, you are saying that you love that person so much that you want to spend the rest of your life with them.  You make a vow that through good and bad, you will stay together “until death do us part.”  These are pretty powerful ideas.  So if two people really are this much in love and really to want to commit themselves to this sort of a bond, then they should be permitted to, whether or not they are heterosexual or homosexual.  \n      Now, all of that said, I still can’t quite shake my old-fashioned ideas about marriage being an act meant for a man and a woman.  Also, although I stated earlier that it is possible to live together and to have children without being married, I feel that if you love someone enough to start a family with them, then for the sake of the children, you should get married.  If you are not planning on staying in a committed relationship with your partner, then you should probably not have children.  \n      As far as whether or not the federal government should be involved in this issue, I feel that we, as a country, should at least be united on the question of the legalization of or banning of gay marriage.  While I do not really feel very strongly one way or another (I am not necessarily a supporter of gay marriage, but I can’t say that I am “offended” by it, or really strongly oppose it either), I do believe that whatever decision is made, should be true throughout the whole country.\n\n",
        "\tI think that gender discrimination is an ongoing issue in the United States.  While it’s being shown that we are slowly improving this, there is still much room in which we can eliminate discrimination.  Statistics even today show that women make lower wages than men do in many companies.  Some places this difference is really subtle, but in others the gaps are much more apparent.  Just the fact that employers must show their employees videos about sexual harassment and gender discrimination proves the existence of many places in which this discrimination is still existing today.\n\tI feel that this is a continuing idea of an outdated mindset that women are inferior to men and their place is in the home rather than in the business.  This mindset not only restricts the rights of other human beings, but also slows down progress that could be made by having women do the same jobs as men.  The job market is not even the biggest source of discrimination of women.  A lot of this discrimination comes from in the home or even just at social gatherings.  Many families assign roles based on gender.  The man will mow the lawn, fix broken appliances, etc while the woman does the grocery shopping, cleans, and does the cooking.  While this is not true in all families, it is in many.  A child growing up in one of these families will assume that this is the way it is supposed to be and in turn become discriminatory, even if not intentional.\n\tThe best way to work on getting rid of discrimination in the workplace and at home is for women to show that they can do all of the same things as men, and for men to learn to accept change.  This should not be a forceful thing, but more of a mutual issue that should be solved.  The use of force may solve the problems revolving around earnings and jobs held in the house, but will only increase tensions.  This in the long run will only lead to make the situation worse and in reality, nothing will be solved.  However, if both sides can stoop down to the same level, neither will be able to overpower the other and eventually change will make way.\n\tWhile gender related jokes can get you a good chuckle sometimes, it is best to try to get rid of these.  Though the message is supposed to be “out of the loop” and only meant to be funny, it also plants stereotypes in your mind.  So all in all, the best ways to get rid of gender discrimination would be for men and women alike to begin ignoring these jokes and stereotypes.  After the stereotypes have been eliminated from both men and women, both sides can begin to progress to a more efficient non-discriminatory society.  Women will get more jobs and men will learn not to question this, wages will level out for both genders and soon enough these will even apply to the household.\n",
        "\tQuestions about privacy usually boil down to the reconciliation of individual rights with collective security.  Whether we are talking about high school safety or national security, the same fundamental questions persist – how might we preserve privacy, yet also preserve the safety of our environment?  What level of intrusion is appropriate for, on one hand, the apprehension of potentially dangerous criminals, yet on the other hand, the preservation of personal privacy?\n\tFrom town police (who identify potential school shooters on MySpace) right on up to federal law enforcement agencies (who, under recent congressional provisions, record our phone calls without court warrant), the American political system is grappling with this question presently.\n\tThe problem I can most plainly identify is one of subversive government conduct.  I am struggling to accept that my country, which I love, has executive agencies who, to the end of national security, justify means like waterboarding.  I was made to memorize certain rhetoric about the foundation of my “American” culture in elementary school; namely about how my country’s respect for individual freedom is unparalleled throughout history.  I thoroughly believed this for a long time.  I am/was proud to say that my grandfather fought, and almost gave his life, for these ideals in World War II.  I see a fundamental contradiction between freedom, which he fought for, and torture.  Seeing this contradiction does not make me “unpatriotic”.  I just want to know, is there a great American “underbelly” which we, the general public, are not privy to?\n\tAre we really so paranoid that subversive measures are necessary? I quickly got over the issue of wiretapping – as it didn’t really affect me.  However, I’m beginning to think that wiretapping is just the issue of the iceberg.\n\tLet’s say, hypothetically, that an extension of our executive intelligence branch, like the NSA, offered unsuspecting college student-citizens a gratuitous amount of money to submit treatises on their political views.  This organization might solicit responses about hot-button political issues which directly affect it, such as the Iraq war effort and wiretapping.\n      Let’s say participating citizens then weren’t at all informed about the source of their enumeration.  Hypothetically, it might be called a “study about the way people communicate”.  If it were truly a study about how people communicate, wouldn’t the organization would be forthcoming and inform all participants of exactly *what* they were getting themselves into?  Citizens with nothing to hide need not worry about wiretapping, right?  Reflexively, shouldn’t agencies with nothing to hide be more forthcoming as well?\n      I had to ask lots and lots of questions to figure out exactly who was funding this study, and when I finally figured it out, it made a lot of sense.\n      I’m not sure exactly why this study is happening, or why my peers and I are being asked to submit these essays on privacy, Iraq, marijuana, gender rights, or other hot button issues.  We are being paid gratuitous amounts of money to do so, which is nice.  I suppose I’ll just think of it as an extension of my income tax refund.  \n      I don’t want to jump to ridiculous “conspiracy theory” conclusions about this study, but it is quite easy to do so.  I had to ask many pointed questions to figure out who is funding this study and where these essays are going.  Once I found out, I sort of sat in denial for a while.  It seems odd that, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, essays like this one will be categorized by NSA data analysts.  Are you looking for subversive citizens?  Or are you just trying to find potential candidates for employment?  I can’t possibly see how this could actually be a study about “how people communicate”, of all the motives which could drive this study, that seems among the least likely/least feasible.\n      If anyone wants to get in touch with me and explain all these details, that would be great.  But I know it will probably never happen.  Supposedly, this essay will not even be tied to my identity (sure, like that’s believable).  I do not mean to sound so vindictive, but as I sat down to write this essay, I started drowning in irony:  I was asked to write an essay on privacy, and the very circumstances under which I was asked could be construed to be an invasion of the same.\n      So don’t peg me for a terrorist or label me a threat to society, because honestly, that would just be silly modern McCarthyism.  I’m a concerned, informed, patriotic, home-loving American.  If it ever really came down to it, I’d absolutely fight for my country.  But I am not stupid, and I take notice of ALL my surroundings with great care and detail.  When things don’t add up, red flags start flying.\n",
        "\tThere is no legal reason to make gay marriage impossible.  Decisions about whether weddings can be performed in a church and recognized as a religious union should be left up to the leaders of specific religions, and the state should stick to determining whether a union is worthy of a legal marriage certificate.  Many gay couples show the same level of commitment as straight couples - they live together, raise children together, and grow old together in sickness and in health.  Why should they not be given the same legal benefits and rights as straight couples?\n\tReligious arguments are perfectly valid.  It is totally dependent on religious leaders to decide whether or not homosexuality is a sin or accepted by their religion, and the attitude members should take toward homosexuals.  They can even decide what rights gay people will have within a religion - whether they will ever be allowed to become priests or rabbis or just allowed to be lay people.  However, that has no effect ( or shouldn’t, at any rate) on the legalization of gay marriage by the government.  Voters and legislators both have to start separating the two issues in their minds.  The decision on whether or not to allow gay marriage should have nothing to do with personal feelings of approval or disapproval of homosexuality.\n\tMembers of the gay community are part of a minority just like Hispanics or African Americans and should be treated accordingly.  The government would never think of denying the right of marriage to African Americans, so why should it to homosexuals?  There is no psychological difference between gay people and straight people; it’s not like they have a mental defect, they just have a different sexual orientation.  They feel the same way about their partners as husbands do about their wives and vice versa, and gay relationships have been shown to be very similar to straight relationships.  Children raised by gay parents have been shown to be well adjusted for the most part, and many children raised by straight couples have been shown to have psychological issues.  The health of children has nothing to do with the orientation of the parents, just the methods and effectiveness of parenting, and so cannot be used as an argument against gay marriage - especially since allowing it would give children a better sense of stability and normality in their home life.\n\tPresident Bush’s proposal for an amendment banning gay marriage is uncalled for and highly questionable from an ethical and legal standpoint.  On what grounds are we trying to deny these people a basic right that everyone else in America enjoys?  They are not posing a threat to heterosexual marriage.  It’s not as if by seeing the happiness of a married gay couple more people are going to become gay.  Heterosexual families and gay families will always remain unique and should be treated as two separate entities, not just a deviation of a single entity.  This is especially a legally charged issue because Bush is not only trying to deny a status of equality to a significant minority in the United States, but legal rights as well like housing, tax and health care advantages.  The federal government should definitely be involved in this issue, but on the side of the rights of the people that it swore to uphold and protect.  If gay people are allowed to live in the United States, own property here, have jobs here, shop here, and be active parts of their communities, then they deserve the same rights as heterosexual people who influence American society and economy in the same ways.\n",
        "      I feel fine about the legalization of marijuana for adults of age in Denver.  However, there should be no discussion about the effects being ‘similar’ to alcohol, as this is a flawed argument.  The reasons that someone should argue for the legalization of a drug such as marijuana should be based on research on the causes and effects – both positive and negative – of using the drug.  It would be perfectly acceptable for alcohol to be used as a control group:  alcohol is legal, so if the drug in question doesn’t produce any negative effects beyond that of alcohol then those results can be used as evidence to support its legalization.\n      On a more personal note, I always thought that alcohol produced far worse effects on a person’s environment then marijuana.  When was the last time you heard about domestic violence from a stoner father?  I’ve never heard of it.  Maybe the kid would come home, notice his dad’s rather sleepy, then become overjoyed as his father treats him out to some TGI Friday’s.  On the other hand, as a college student I’ve witnessed many examples of how someone doesn’t need to be an alcoholic to screw their life up.  Every weekend, multiple students get written up by their Resident Assistants for public intoxication or performing some idiotic activity while drunk, such as urinating on the side of a building.  During these times, where are the stoners?  Breaking and entering?  Carjacking people on North Charles Street? Robbing a liquor store?  None of the above, folks!  Basic logic tells you that with the amount of students at a college like Loyola, someone somewhere is taking hits from the bong, and they’re not even getting caught.  The reason for this is because laughing maniacally at reruns of South Park on Comedy Central while ordering from three different take out restaurants isn’t a crime.  The worst punishment for that would be a noise violation.\n      Of course, the legalization of marijuana isn’t something to be taken as a joke (in its entirety).  There are people who question where the drugs come from in the first place, or if the people they are buying from are supporting some terrorist organization.  With the federal legalization of marijuana, this problem would be eradicated.  Once someone gets a hold of some pot seeds, everybody and their brother would be cultivating their own stash.  As an added bonus, the new demand would probably create a whole new industry which in turn would create numerous jobs.  There have been rumors of cigarette producing companies such as Phillip Morris spending money researching how to go about marketing a marijuana cigarette, just in case the government decides to legalize it.  Even if that is just a rumor, it would be hard to imagine Big Business witness the birth of such a great moneymaking opportunity without capitalizing on it themselves. \n      After discussing all of the above points, it is important to note that marijuana will not be legalized federally at any point in the near future.  So, if you plan on smoking the reefer, you’d also better plan on hiding out in your comfortable living room eating deliciously greasy American food… but I don’t think that idea will bother you that much.\n",
        "\tI do not think gender discrimination is as much of a problem as it used to be, but it certainly still poses a problem in the present-day United States.  Whether the issue is occupation, political representation, or academic representation, among others, there is certainly still room for improvement.  One of the dangers of the discrimination that still exists today is that it is underlying and not necessarily out in the open like the issue used to be.\n\tOne way to fix the problem is not just recognize the group with a disadvantage (the women), but also have the group with advantages recognize those unearned privileges.  This interesting idea struck me the first time I heard it because it presents a completely new side to an ongoing historical issue amongst the genders.  So, to use this idea in a way that can help fix gender discrimination, males must understand that certain privileges they have are just that, privileges.  Many things have come unearned due to gender discrimination and a seemingly unconscious notion to favor males in the United States.  If these unearned advantages can be recognized as taking place, then action can be taken to offset them and act in fairness or justice when future issues present themselves.  \n\tWhen looking at the make-up of the corporate population in the United States it would certainly prove evidence enough that women are still being discriminated against.  The rate of discrimination, however, has dropped significantly and the numbers are starting to make a turn for the better.  Discrimination is something that will not be fixed over night; representation for females in the corporate world can not be immediately put to equilibrium.  Certainly if statistics are analyzed over the past decade or so, they would show a rise in the number of females taking on upper-level executive positions within companies.  This is evidence that discrimination did exist but is in the process of being fixed.  \n\tI do feel men are discriminated on from time to time as almost all individual is at some point in his or her life.  To help fix or mend the discrimination against females in the past, there are many companies partaking in a form of affirmative action.  In this situation, if there were a male and a female being considered for the same position, the job would go to the female if the qualifications were similar.  In this case men are certainly being discriminated against but that is necessary in order to fix decades, if not centuries, of gender discrimination against females.  \n\tAdditionally, I think men are discriminated against just as much as other groups in society.  Stereotypes do exist about men jut as they do about women, other ethnicities, or age.  I do not think, however, that these stereotypes that some hold about the male gender and use as a form of discrimination have affected men the way women have been affected.  Certainly the affects of discrimination against females are much more noticeable in the workforce and beyond.\n",
        "      I definitely feel that gender discrimination is an issue in the present-day United States.  I also feel that women are discriminated against much more than men, especially in the workplace.  Regardless of opinions, studies have been done which show that on average, men receive higher salaries than women who perform the exact same jobs.  To me, this seems completely unfair.  If two people do the exact same thing, have the same role and perform the same tasks, why should the male get paid more than the female?  This is gender discrimination.\n\tYou often hear about the glass ceiling that women fact in the workplace, particularly in the business world.  They can see above, where they might like to go, but they can not actually reach it.  In the hierarchy of Corporate America, most (not all) of the highest ranking positions are held by men.  Yes, women are involved in management and have high level jobs, but the majority of the top positions are filled by men.  It often seems that women can climb the ladder, but they can not quite make it all the way up to the top.  I can’t see the fairness in this.  If women are equally as qualified, why can’t they hold the same positions as men?\n\tI don’t know how to solve this problem until the stereotypes are eliminated.  What I mean is that until we as a society get over these misconceptions, we will not be able to eliminate gender discrimination.  For example, say that two people are being interviewed for a top management job.  They both have identical resumes, but one of the applicants is female and the other is male.  If the general atmosphere in the office is that men can perform these leadership jobs better than women, just this stereotype works against the woman.  If the employer feels that the man will receive more respect from his peers than the female, this will help the male to better perform his job and thus it makes sense to hire the man over the woman.  This vicious cycle will repeat itself over and over again.  The women never get the chance to earn the respect that they deserve because in order to earn the respect, they have to be given the opportunity to prove themselves worthy of that respect.\n\tI do not feel that men are discriminated against nearly as much as women.  One way that I can think that men face discrimination is in the stereotype of women being more nurturing and better at taking care of children.  For example, when a couple gets divorced, often the mother is more likely to get custody of the children.  This situation has begun to improve greatly.  Another example of this stereotype against men would be to think of a situation of a day care center.  Imagine that you went to drop your kids off to daycare and all of the teachers at the day care were men.  You might me somewhat more hesitant to leave your kids with these men than you would to leave them with a group of women.   But in general, I feel that women face much more discrimination than men do.\n",
        "\tI think that both sides are wrong when approaching the issue of gay marriage.  I feel that it is not up to the state or federal government to make a decision on this issue.  While some will argue that they are just trying to get a deduction on their taxes, they do not provide any legitimate reasons as to why they shouldn’t be able to just because they are married to someone of the same sex.  Allowing homosexuals to marry wouldn’t have any negative impact on the economy since taxes remain gender unspecific.  However, it would also be wrong to force all churches to allow gay marriage.  Some branches of a certain faith would be forced to go against their own beliefs for the appeasement of others.  These churches should be allowed to practice what they believe without the interference of the government just as much as those who wish to legalize gay marriage.\n\tSome may bring up the moral issues with homosexual marriage.  The idea of homosexual marriage may be against their beliefs, but just because that is so, doesn’t mean that everyone is against it.  Trying to enforce this idea onto others would just be like using coercive methods to get everybody to believe in God.  I consider myself agnostic and find no fault in allowing homosexuals to marry.  However, it is not up to the government to decide whether homosexuals be allowed to marry or not allowed.\n\tThis decision is solely up to the church in which the couple is being married.  The idea of “separation of church and state” has been well known and instituted throughout generations, and it is not the time to start crossing the lines.  If it were up to me I would not allow any kind of marriage to be able to satisfy some kind of tax deduction.  This could be done through other sort of methods (such as the idea of Civil-Unions).\n\tPresident Bush has no right (according to the already existing U.S. constitution) to impose this new amendment.  The governments powers do not extend this far and they shouldn’t try to do so.  I feel that this is an act of tyranny, an attack on the restrictions given to the federal government when this document was written.  There is no way to say that this is a fair idea for an amendment without backing it with your personal religious opinions or sexual biases.   There is no clear evidence that this would have a negative impact on anything other than those who oppose it.  What gets done in the government should be what is in the interest of its citizen’s rights and its own limitations, not in the public interest.  The movement to make this an amendment is a fine example of our government moving towards a neo-conservative administration.\n\tIt is not up for the government to decide upon this issue, it is only up to the church.  Through separation of church and state, President Bush’s proposal for a new amendment is illegal.  I can’t forget to mention that if passed, this would be the first amendment that restricted the people rather than the government.\n",
        "\tGay marriage should be legalized in every state.  It is wrong to discriminate against someone for any reason, especially if that reason is not under his or her control.  Many people say that homosexuals are just confused or sick with a disease and they can choose to be straight.  Logically, that is completely ridiculous.  No person would ever voluntarily submit themselves to the pain and anguish a homosexual and his or her family inevitably goes through when that person finally “comes out of the closet.”  This pain is caused by the media and its everyday assistance in painting an embarrassing picture of homosexuals in general.  Therefore, no person holds the right to label a couple’s love for one another as wrong simply because both members of the couple are of the same sex.\n\tFurthermore, the Federal government should have no say regarding a couple’s right to marriage.  Marriage is neither a legal nor moral concern, nor is it a matter of national security.  It is a right that any two people should have to graft their lives together in a beautiful act of love for one another.  To deny someone’s right to marriage is a violation of their rights as a human being.  Unless the government can present a legitimate reason for the banning of gay marriage, it should be legalized in every state in this country.\n",
        "Personally, I do not think that the church needs to modernize or change its ways to adjust to society. I think that society should adjust to the ways of the church. The church was established a certain way, centuries ago and should be left as it is.\nI understand the concerns for the lack of young priests. It would not be my suggestion to allow priests to marry nor to allow women to become priests. I understand that it is not specifically stated anywhere that women cannot become priests, but I am not one for making this change. I also realize that men only became priests for some issue over land or something along those lines. As it seems, not Jesus, nor the religious councils seemed to care whether women became priests, but because of the land issues, whatever they are, priesthood was more suitable for men. I feel that women are better suited for the position of nuns. I am giving into gender stereotypes, but I feel the priest in being a man, is the stronger figure, while the nun, in being a woman, is the gentler figure. I guess it is hard for me to change something I am so used to and would prefer the church to remain as traditional as possible, even if that means not changing with modern times.\nAlso, I do not think that allowing priests to marry would decrease the acts of pediophilia. Some say that marriage would allow for a release of these urges, but in becoming a priest don’t they chose or learn to resist such urges? I think the problem is found in the character and discipline of some of these men. It is all too often that I hear of stories, whether they are from reliable sources like the news or from less reliable sources, like television programs, where pediophilia occurs in the least likely of places. Pediophilia can occur with a teacher, a married man, even family members. So, to say that allowing priests to marry would decrease the rates of pediophilia, is just not true. Allowing priests to marry may encourage more young men to become a priest, but I do not believe that it will have an impact on these disgusting sexual acts. Maybe priests should be required to take some sort of pyschological test before they can enter the priesthood, like police officers and FBI employees are required to take.\nI do feel for those who are restricted by the church, but every person has their own reason and can chose their own religion. I do not think they should try to change anothers religion just because they can not follow it. \n\n",
        "I do think that marijuana should be legalized. Not only will it reduce some of the illegal activity taking place involving the buying and selling of drugs, but it would be a good resource of money for the government who could use any resources they can get. Also, it does have therapeutic purposes for those with terminal illnesses. The main reason why I think marijuana should be legalized is because it is no more potent than alcohol. We hear of alcohol related deaths and incidents regularly but you do not really hear of such incidents involving marijuana. Also, alcohol can be very bad for you health wise, especially when drank in excess, which it typically is. Although marijuana may be worse for you than cigarettes, the difference probably is not that significant, especially since the majority of those who smoke marijuana also smoke cigarettes, so they are setting themselves up for health problems in the future regardless. I think that if alcohol is going to be legal for consumption, then marijuana should be too and obviously they will have the same rules about legal age and driving under the influence. Of all the illegal drugs, marijuana is the most used and the least dangerous. Regardless of whether or not is it legal, people are going to use it, so the government might as well get the upper hand by legalizing and being able to control the market. Not only is marijuana the least dangerous of the illicit and illegal drugs, but it is less dangerous than many prescription drugs as well. If these drugs are legal for medical reasons, then why not legalize marijuana at least for these reasons too?\nReally, I do not think there are any good reasons not to legalize marijuana besides to save the pride of the government. In reality however, I think that they will be doing themselves some good by giving in and legalizing it. And it is not as though they are legalizing the really dangerous and life threatening substances like heroine of cocaine; marijuana effects are not nearly as drastic and potent as these drugs. \n\n",
        "I have mixed feelings on the Catholic Church.  Most of the reason for this is because I don’t really care at all about it.  I don’t like religion on a whole, basically believing that if one wants a relationship with God, it should be more personal and less through a religious institution.  That being said, I believe however that the church is very useful for some people, and has done a great many good things for many people.  It’s just not for me.\nIf i were to join a religious group however, I would not join the Catholic Church.  It is too ritualistic and traditionalist for my liking, and a little too conservative policy-wise.  When it comes down to issues, though, I don’t really care about whether or not they have female priests, or if priests can get married and have children.  It’s not my business to tell the pope or priests what they should do.  Besides, I feel that it is necessary in any situation to have people on both sides of issues.  I mean, if we didn’t have liberals and conservatives in America, we wouldn’t be the same country.  Argument between progressivism and traditionalism is absolutely necessary to make progress.  I don’t really like liberals or conservatives, I think they are both wrong and full of crap, but I’m glad we have both of them.  I feel the same with the church.  I don’t like the Catholic Church, but I feel it is necessary to have them, and to have a more conservative, traditional church so that newer, more liberal churches do not forget about the history of Christianity.\nHowever, what I do have a problem with is how big the Catholic Church is.  Most Catholics believe they are the “true” Christianity and don’t believe that other branches in the World Council of Churches are as Christian as they are.  This is completely wrong.  While I would certainly like to throw some branches of Christianity out (like Jehovah’s Witnesses or Baptists)  I feel like certain weight should be placed on the influence of both the Catholic Church and other churches of the world.  And with how many times the Catholic church has screwed up over the years, it really shouldn’t be acting like hot shit.  It ain’t.  Basically what I’m trying to say is: If the catholic church isn’t willing to change, maybe they should stop acting like they are the most important people on the world in Gods eyes.  I don’t really know how to word what I’m trying to say here, but I hope it’s understand. \n\n",
        "I believe that as citizens of the United States everyone is entitled to a certain level of privacy. But then again the right to privacy can be taken granted for. If everyone in this country were legitimate people and never attempted to wrong people in anyway the right to complete and total privacy of the citizens of the U.S. would be understood. But because we have people like the guy who killed innocent people at Virginia Tech., we have to constantly be apprehensive about the capability of certain people. However, I do think the idea think the idea of a National ID system is an excellent idea, as a means of keeping track of everyone in the U.S. but this goes to show that the government will always have some control over its people. And it’s the bad people that make living in this country so tiring for everyone else who are just trying to make a good life for themselves and their family.\n \nAlso I believe the companies and employers should gather as much information as possible on their employees so that they could use it fro possible networking but also if something were to happen like money was being stolen from the company, it would have a way of aiding to the capture of the culprit instead of taking extra time to find out their personal information. Nevertheless, there is always that one person that makes all of these ideas difficult to execute. Furthermore, although I do agree on the collection of all of this information, I do not agree on it to be open to any and everyone. I believe that if the information including medical information needs to accessed by any higher authority then a warrant is needed and if anyone needs to access someone’s information that they have no legal rights to then their needs to be extensive paper work and time to be put into receiving the information.\n\n",
        "Let’s be dead honest here.  Most people today have at least tried pot.  A good number of those who have tried pot have done it more than once.  Now personally I can’t see much of a difference between alcohol use and pot use.  Both are harmful to the person, and alcohol really doesn’t have any use in the medical field (not drinkable alcohol anyway) but yet it’s legal.  People drink and drive and end up killing people, but alcohol is still legal.  People overdue alcohol and destroy their lives, but it’s still legal.  I think that when the argument about how pot use will boom and we will end up having people not working or coming to work stoned or going to class stoned is used we aren’t giving humanity enough credit.  Not everyone is going to be a burnout, just like not everyone is going to be an alcoholic.  It’s all about personal choices.  Why should one harmful chemical be legal and the other not? Then there’s the argument that marijuana can be harmful to your health.  Well what about liver failure and kidney failure from alcohol?  Anything done out of moderation is going to be bad for your health.  At least marijuana can be used for some good medically.  To be honest, I don’t think people would start using marijuana all the time, obviously some people would, but not all of them.  Our economy wouldn’t crash; our way of life wouldn’t change.  There’s another argument that if alcohol is legal then we shouldn’t need marijuana to be legal.  Let’s be honest, we don’t really need either of them, but if one is legal they both should be, or neither.  I don’t think that use would boom if it was made legal, the novelty of doing something “illegal” will be gone, so that base of reasoning will be done with.  Most people don’t drink insanely just because they turn 21, so why would that happen with marijuana? \n\n",
        "Wow…I have many different feelings on the Operation Iraqi Freedom and the War on Terrorism. In reality, it changes weekly, but I tend to support the war. Yes, I’m sure that everybody reading this hates me now for saying this, but I could care less.\nGoing back to September 11th, it was very reasonable for everyone to support the war. We had been attacked and abused- something that we, the GREATEST country in the world, are not used to. Naturally we want to defend ourselves by eliminating the problem at its roots. It is true that, as the discussion starter says, it was never proven that Saddam had connections with Al Qaeda. The discussion starter has a liberal sense about it tied with a pessimistic view- the way America is acting right now. I feel that this attitude is what got us going in circles…because everyone lost the enthusiasm created after September 11th.\nA country will be a horrible place if its people do not support their leader. Look at Saddam’s Iraq- people were slaughtered every day who did not support his ways. This was truely a Hell hole. People were thrown in meat grinders, etc.- if this isn’t part of Terror, then what it God’s name is?\nI obviously love America, but it pisses me off when people turn their backs away from their leader. Instead of just going against what he/she says, why don’t you try to work with them? Although this is the ideal setting within a country, it can’t work all the time. We as Americans do not know everything that is going on in the world today- even though many of us act as though we do. We feel that if we do research from the media we know a great deal about the war. We don’t. I totally agree with people who say that most of America is swayed in a negative way by the media’s pesimistic view of the war. It eventually gets to people hating a person like Bush (I know, he’s by far not the best leader we’ve had……”BY FAR” I stress) just because thats what they see on T.V. and figure that it must be correct.\nIt puts me to shame that things such as September 11th make us act like true Americans. Now, with the recent shooting at Virginia Tech, people have also come together as a whole through mourning. What’s wrong with this country if we can only be UNITED within the UNITED STATES by a catastrophe?\nIn the end, I feel as though America should support Bush and our efforts in the Middle East. I have talked with soldiers about the topic and they do not feel supported by America’s “pull out of Iraq” view. I feel that this general view looks down upon the soldiers even though they’re apparently supporting the soldiers. All it comes down to is a lot of America doesn’t like Bush- that’s why they want the soldiers out of Iraq. Harsh, I know, but words do tend to come out in an exaggerated sense while writing.\nAs a summary, we know we’re at a stand still- Let’s support Bush and our Soldiers so we can give the country the confidence to get the job done finally and get our amazing soldiers back home… \n\n",
        "            The war in Iraq may have started out as a controversial issue, but it is quickly becoming more controversial as the United States maintains its presence there, and even increases the amount of troops it sends.  Some of the causes of this controversy are the tolls of war on the American people, the unclear purpose of the war, and the ultimate goals for the Iraqi people.\n            An obvious source of opposition to the war is the cost to the American people.  As the United States sends more and more troops to fight in the war, the number of families being split up and soldiers dying increases.  War takes a physical toll in the number of people it kills, as well as an emotional toll in the number of people it affects.  No one wants to see these negative effects of war, so it is no wonder that the movement in opposition to the war has gathered more energy as the war has picked up and its negative consequences are more apparent.\n            People are likely to support the war, despite its negative effects, if the advantages outweigh the detriments.  The problem, however, lies in determining the advantages to the war in Iraq, because the purpose of the United States there is so unclear.  It is hard to rationalize the cost of war without recognizing progress towards the war’s goals.  Since the goals are so ambiguous and unknown to the American people, the disadvantages of the war take the stage in the forefront of the American mind.\n            While the goals for the war are largely unclear, it has been suggested that power will eventually be given to the Iraqi people.  Just how this will play out is difficult to determine.  The American people have not been told clearly how the transition in power will take place, and it is hard to place faith in something that has not been entirely explained or supported.  It sounds like a great idea in theory, but may not actually work in practice.\n            The war is becoming harder and harder to support as more Americans are affected, and few goals are realized.  Perhaps the war would gain more support if the government were more explicit in stating their goals and intentions for the Iraqi people. \n\n",
        "Gay marriage should absolutely be allowed and people, in general, should strive to have an open mind on the subject.  It is very easy for people, especially when they do not realize they are doing it, to make a judgment on an issue based on the norm.  People naturally resist change and since this topic has been dormant for so long, people have not thought about it.\nIf people were to truly open their minds up on the topic and apply thought to it, the argument for gay marriage is not that difficult.  One argument may be that it deviates from the “natural purpose” of marriage.  Well, once more, natural purpose is something that has been defined by man, just as the institution of marriage.  As long as people, afraid of change, are creating the definitions, then certainly it will be difficult to allow same-sex marriages.\nWhile parents consisting of two men or two women would be obviously different then a man and a woman, there is no saying one is better than the other.  The problem, once more, is that people are used to a majority of parents being the traditional man and woman.  However, I would argue that one of the most important factors in a successful family life is love, and if someone who is gay is forced, by society, to marry someone of the opposite sex, true love will not be accomplished.  Without that true love, the child may have greater problems because he or she did not grow up in a loving environment.\nWhile religion will most likely stubbornly compete to keep gay marriage out of practice, the governments should enact gay marriage laws making it legal.  The government is merely present to protect the rights of the citizens and tends to overstep its bounds.  In this case, the people should have the right to marry as they please, without any sort of governmental obstacles.\n\n",
        "The Big BF (Ben Franklin) said it best: “Those who would sacrifice essential liberties for a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.” I don’t think the government has the right to apply numbers to its populace essentially for the purpose of tracking them. We already have social security numbers, which function in place of our names on all kinds of documents and assorted, meaningless pieces of paper. The idea that our government would have the initiative or the wherewithal to institute a national ID system on top of all the paper pushing they already do is extreme and pointless.\nThe idea of a federal centralized data bank monitoring a national ID system also runs counter to the forgotten notion that some things are simply the prerogative of the state governments. In most cases, it’s the job of the individual states to track criminals who have committed crimes within their borders. To create a federally controlled system would once again strip away rights that essentially (and constitutionally) belong to the states.\nIf this weren’t enough, a national ID system would be functionally useless, anyway. Mtnbike9 made a very important point about how easy it is to forge identity information. Creating a database of national ID numbers would be a way to spend millions of dollars to put one small hurdle on the track for those who want to commit terrorist acts or serious crimes. It also presupposes that anyone who commits a crime can be easily tracked; just because a person has a number attached to their name doesn’t mean you’ll be able to find them, and thieves, murderers, and terrorists don’t shout out their names and ID numbers before committing crimes. The only purpose and ID bank would serve is as a tracking system for people the government wants to monitor in advance of crimes, but a.) the government already has several such numbers it applies to its citizens and uses them frequently, and b.) the system would just become another expensive, logistical nightmare. We live in bureaucracy already. Let’s not just give them more little pieces of paper to file, since that’s about all a national ID system would be. \n\n",
        "First of… who in the world declared this as a war!!! Bush is using the war in iraq as a way to benefit himself. Imagine if even after he has left office Iraq is on the way to becoming a democratic country! He would have full bragging rights in saying that he started it, and it was in his doing that and “declaring” the war on terror and bringing Iraq into the picture that they are a democratic state. And also America being the selfish place that it is, wants to democratize Iraq so as to keep their source of oil within their reach.\n \n“Bush supporters say its better to fight terrorists in Iraq than in the USA,” wow this statement took me by surprise. I suspect that if these people support Bush then they are supporting his idea of democratizing Iraq and building a new country. So has does that happen with continued fighting in Iraq? Granted most of the fighting is only taking place in a few areas and isn’t as countrywide as the media leads us all to believe but still how can a country grow if its getting constantly setback by bombings.\n \nWow!! Gobigdonny has but everything that I would feel about the war if I actually knew a sufficient amount of information into my own words. I was one of those people who after 9/11 was so exited to go over to Iraq and whop some Iraqi ass but that’s all I  knew about the war. And that’s what the government fed off of when 9/11, they thought we normally might not have everyone’s support but because people are angry we will definitely have it now to go over to Iraq and basically tear down all their establishments and start over. So they can build a little “America” in Iraq. \n\n",
        "I’m not going to pretend to be an expert on the economic benefits or consequences of legalizing marijuana.  Therefore, instead of focusing on whether it would “reduce the national deficit”, I will focus on the social benefits/ramifications of the drug.\nFirst off, a vast majority of people who are in college (and these days possibly high school) have witnessed the effects of smoking marijuana, even if they personally don’t smoke - such as myself.  While it would be foolish and untrue to make a claim like “everybody’s doing it!”, smoking pot has become acceptable enough in today’s society that enough people do smoke, increasing the number of people previously described.  So, as a neutral observer, it seems to me that the negative effects of marijuana aren’t as bad as those of alcohol. I’ve never heard about people going to the hospital/dying of a marijuana overdose, but every weekend alcohol makes people sick and even takes lives.  Then again, in any altered state, whether induced by marijuana or alcohol, a person’s decision making ability is hindered.  So, while pot may not kill people outright by itself, it may lead to poor decisions that cause greater harm.\nThe only strong concern I have about the legalization of marijuana is what it will do to the level of drugs considered social.  People say pot is a gateway drug, and I agree wholeheartedly.  I consider a “gateway drug” a substance that may lead to other stronger, more daring substances. But, if you use the same definition, that means cigarettes and alcohol are gateway drugs.  I’m not saying that people who smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol will become degenerate addicts, but that’s because these two things are completely integrated with our society.  Sure, when you are younger they seem the cool and adventurous thing to do, but eventually you grow up.  I would consider marijuana the hardest drug the average American would try in this period where being cool and adventurous matters to them.  So if marijuana - a relatively harmless drug that in some cases could be compared to alcohol - becomes legalized, it will fall into a category more accepted by society, an therefore less adventurous.  My worry is that kids will then turn to psychadelics or hardcore drugs (like cocaine) quicker if marijuana is legalized.  Therefore, I don’t think I would push for the legalization of marijuana. \n\n",
        "The war effort in Iraq wasn’t just a mistake, it was a colossal mistake based upon specious evidence. Many commentators at the beginning of the war posed significant questions about the Bush administrations sources for the evidence they were using to justify an invasion: Were they using information from suspects who had been tortured or had other motivations to lie? To what extent was the belief that Saddam’s regime had WMD’s based upon their mere refusal to cooperate with Un weapons inspectors? Even Colin Powell, after presenting his evidence to the UN Security Council, later stated that he did not find that very same evidence convincing.\nI think it’s pretty clear that this administration came into office with the intent to go to war with Iraq–many insiders have indicated as much–and I think that they had multiple reasons for doing it. 1.) “To make the world safe for democracy.” This is a stupid idea, as proven by much of twentieth century history. The US has intervened in well over twenty countries over the course of the past century as part of efforts to bring democratic stability to those countries. Guess how many now have working democratic governments? None. 2.) “To stabilize the Middle East.” A respectable ambition, but completely destabilizing a regional center isn’t the best way to accomplish it, now is it? 3.) “To create a power vacuum in which the country becomes economically and politically dependent upon the US so that we can export their resources (oil) in ways more economically amenable to ourselves, and provide fringe benefits for large sectors of the US economy (defense contractors).” Oops, did I say that one out loud?\nThis isn’t just a case of bad decision making, this is a case of criminal decision making. It has cost hundreds of thousands of lives with a rationale that can barely be articulated. We’ve made a mess of an important geo-political region, and it’s high time we found a way to begin re-stabilizing that region. Based upon what this administration has done so far, we haven’t been left with many options. \n\n",
        "I again agree that the church needs to change, however, I also belive that some of the traditions need to be kept. While I do find it somewhat difficult to accept that everything one man says goes in a society where everyone is raised in the ideas of democracy and collaborative decisions, in a way I also like having the Pope as the head of the church. I like that he is there to make sure that all of the churches across the world are teaching the same readings at every service and are giving the same answers to questions that are universally asked. This to me, cuts back on the questionablility of the church, because it is all the same and there are no differences that are sloshed about from congrigation to congrigation. This is not to say that I necessarily agree with every thing though, because I certainly don’t.I am not quite sure if I believe that woman should be priests or not…I guess I feel that they should maybe be called something differnt other than priests, but still be able to give communion. Or maybe they can be priests, not really sure on that area…I do know that I would probably be a little wierded out if i saw one as a priest giving communion at a catholic church, just becuase it has never happened before. \nI do however, strongly feel as if priests should be able and have the opportunity to be married again. THe only reason whey this privilage was taken away in the past was back in the day when the corruption occured in the catholic church (just as corruption has occured in every possible other religion.) But the priests and bishops were not paying any attention to their duties as priests and bishops and were paying more attention to thier personal lives. THat is why the law was made, but I feel as if we have definatly overcome this obstical and can now handel our priests getting married again. This is a huge reason why we do not have as many people being ordaned, because many would be priest also want families and so they usually opt for the family. I know that is the case for my father’s freind. He wanted a family and so found something else he enjoyed doing to take on as his career and instead stared a family.\nThese are the reasons why I think the church needs to change, but also find a balance in how to still stay a bit of the same. I feel as if we should still have a Pope, but have it so that his word is not the final and only word. That again, it is more of a president type figure and a democracy running religion. I like the basic set up of the Catholic religion, and I also like how they are very tollerant of other people’s religions and views, and accept what they believe in instead of automatically trying to change them. This is not to say that they do not spread the word of God to those that wish to listen and learn, because they do, but they do not force people into it. A lot of times people who are not Catholic, and probably even some people who are Catholic, think that they condem those who are not Catholic or push people into Catholism, but this is not the case at all. That is one aspect of the church that I really like. So I do believe that the church has a bit of adjusting to do, but does not need to get rid of all of its traditions, thoughts, ideas, customs,…etc.\n\n",
        "After September 11, 2001, the United States was in turmoil. People wanted to take action, they wanted to see these terrorists be captured and locked up, they were sad, hurt, confused, and scared. President Bush, I believe, had no other choice but to declare war on these nations. If we didn’t, we would risk the fact that these terrorist organizations might think that they have weakened and beaten us, which they have not. It could have lead to even more deadly attacks. In the beginning, this war seemed like a good thing. Then, slowly but surely, we began to lose focus on what we went in their to do and now we are stuck. If we leave, we risk more terrorist attacks and a possible downfall of what we tried to build their, a governing body. If we stay, we only lose more money and more American lives. I was one of those Americans whom at first, was all for the war. I wanted to see the terrorists be captured and I wanted them to feel the pain that they caused our nation to feel on that day. I lost five people on September 11, 2001. My family was scared, saddened, and angry. As time went on, I just kept seeing that we were just losing more and more lives. We were making more and more family’s feel the way my family did on that day. I is unnecessary for us to stay their and, moreover, keep sending more men over. I believe that the people over there are always going to be stuck in their own ways, they have been for years. And, if they can’t stop fighting with themselves, then we certainly cannot help them. The people over there also think that we are interfering with their culture and all that. I am sick of hearing that. If they do not want our help, then I don’t see why we should sacrifice anymore men and women. \n\n",
        "I think there is a definite need for the Catholic Church to modernize.  For starters, they should allow women to become priests.  By not doing so, they are sending a message that women aren’t equal to men.  Isn’t one of the central teachings of Jesus that all people are created equal?  Women are perfectly capable of fulfilling priestly duties.  There are numerous Protestant denominations that allow women to become priests, and it seems to work for them.  It is the Church itself that is losing out because it refuses to let women become priests.  What will happen when there aren’t enough male priests?  Such a situation is fast approaching.\nI think one of the reasons why the Church is reluctant to change anything is the fact that it would seem like a sign of weakness.  If the Church has gone on for this long, it might seem like it has made a mistake in not allowing women priests.  The Church really isn’t about admitting mistakes (after all, the pope is infallible, right?).  By just keeping the status quo, the Church can go on thinking that all they do in this world is right.\nI also think the Church should allow priests to marry.  This would attract a large number of young men to the dwindling ranks of priesthood.  The Church will say that priests can devote themselves only to God.  I really don’t think a spouse would detract from their devotion to God.  Again, a lot of Protestant denominations allow their priests to marry, and it seems to work just fine.\nThe Church should definitely change its views on homosexuality.  If homosexuality is indeed genetic, the Church is just discriminating against people who have no control over something.  To call it a sin to be gay is just wrong.  As science advances, so does our knowledge.  The Church should accept this knowledge and change its ways accordingly. \n\n",
        "I feel like we all pretty much agree on this one. I see no reason gay couples should be prevented from getting married, and to this point I have heard no convincing arguments against gay marriage. There are the old standard points: procreation is a part of marriage, gay couples will change the meaning of family… but procreation is not a part of all marriages (and who are we to tell people who are unable to have children together that their marriage is invalid??) and homosexuals share the same family styles as heterosexual couples. I wonder what people are afraid will happen if gay couples are married. What would change? Gay couples already live together and raise families together… they deserve to do so in the same legal standing as heterosexual couples.\nIt may not be the most common argument, but the most emotional argument I’ve heard against gay marriage is religious. In the Catholic Church and many other churches and religions, gay couples can’t be married. People don’t want a governmental approval of gay marriage to interfere with the workings of their church, so they are against it. In reality, all the legalization of gay marriage would do is give homosexual couples the same legal standing as heterosexual couples – their natural right. Nowhere in legislation is there any mention of forcing churches to perform ceremonies marrying homosexuals. Gay marriage would just be the legal recognition that gay couples have an equal status to straight ones.\nThe trouble in agreeing on gay marriage comes when people let their emotions take them over. It’s possible to disagree in principle with something and still politically approve of it. Just because a group of people believe that gay marriage is somehow morally wrong, does that make homosexuals less human and less deserving of the rights which we all share? Legal rights have to be separated from personal opinions to really ensure equality.\n\n",
        "            One of the main issues with privacy rights is why people want certain information to remain confidential.  If they have nothing to hide, people are generally unconcerned by privacy issues, because there will be no consequences if others find out their personal information.  Still, some people are bothered by the fact that private information could become available to certain people who could use the information against them.  The best example of this is medical privacy, and people’s desire to keep medical records secure so that employers do not discriminate against them.  The same issue persists with genetic privacy and possible discrimination by employers.\n            There are these disadvantages such as employment discrimination associated with the collection of private data.  It is important, however, to remember, that employment discrimination is a misuse, or even abuse, of this collected data.  Data collection is not intended to enable discrimination of the workplace.  That is merely a negative consequence that comes along with the collection of personal information for worthwhile purposes.  Therefore, it is not fair to blame the process of personal information collection for the ways in which the information it gathers is misused.  There is nothing wrong with collecting data for useful purposes, but rather when it is used in ways that were not intended, such as for discriminating against possible employees based on their medical histories.\n            In fact, the collection of personal information can be quite useful, especially in keeping terrorist attacks from happenings.  In an age where national security is particularly important, we should be compliant with measures that are intended to protect us.  Recorded communication, for example, can be helpful in foiling terrorist plots, and being willing to have phone conversations recorded, emails tracked, and letters followed could help keep the nation secure from terrorist actions.  Doing so is particularly important in today’s day and age, where there are many more terrorist plans against the United States than its citizens are even aware of, because many are thwarted before they reach the public, thanks to the aid of the collection of private information.  As long as safeguards are taken against its misuse, the collection of information for uses in nation security should continue. \n\n",
        "While gender discrimination is something that should always be avoided ideally, there are some problems I have with the issue in general. \n As the discussion starter states, discrimination because of sex is defined as adverse action against another person, that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex.  However, how is it possible for someone to determine with absolute certainty that the “adverse action” was caused entirely by sex, and had no other factors.  In an ideal world, gender discrimination can be pointed out in an action where every single factor amongst two parties of opposite sex are the same except for gender.  However, it is obvious that this is not an ideal world. Therefore, no one can ever say for sure if any action is pure gender discrimination or not. For clear cut situations that meet the ideal world’s standards, then action should be taken to avoid gender discrimination by all means. However, the vast majority of situations will be those that are not ideal, and the entire issue is clouded because of this fact.\nOne large factor in the development of the issue of gender discrimination is the rise of the feminist movement from the 1960s to the present.  A main goal of the feminist movement is to close the gap of differences between men and women so women receive equal opportunities as men.  However, since the feminist movement began, the connotation of the typical feminist has evolved into a hatred for the entire male population.  Thus, through all of their efforts to close this gender-based gap, they only widen the very gap they are attempting to close.  Also, by stressing the need for women to “get out of the kitchen” and enter the workforce, and basically take on the same role as the male parent, feminism is removing an integral piece of the balanced household.  If a couple has children, whether the mother stays home and nurtures them or drops them off at a day care center each morning for the duration of the day has an enormous impact on the development of that child. \n\n",
        "           I agree with many of the ideas stated in the previous two posts.  In regards to laws about gay marriage basically what I think is, “Who are we to decide that two people who love each other can not get married?”  I don’t think that there is any legitimate argument for banning gay marriage.  What right does the government have to make such a law?  I like the analogy brought up about comparing this situation to banning left-handed people from operating a forklift.\n            Some of the arguments that I have heard against gay marriage seem to confuse a legal marriage with a church marriage.  If someone gets married in the Catholic Church, for example, they obtain a civil marriage license and ALSO go through a certain process within the Church.  While the Church might have its own reasons for not allowing homosexuals to marry within the Church, I see no reason why the couple should be denied a civil marriage.   As stated, the decisions of a specific religious group “have no proper bearing on the law.”  I definitely feel that this is one area where religious opponents of gay marriage have faulty logic: they confuse the idea of the sacrament of marriage with the legal right to marry.\n            With all of this talk about marriage, we must ask ourselves why people get married.  It is possible to live together and/or to have children without being married, so why do people get married??  I think that one reason is that in marrying someone, you are saying that you love them so much that you are willing to commit yourself to a lifelong relationship with them.  I believe that if two people, heterosexual or homosexual, are so  much in love that they are willing to make this serious a commitment, as an outsider to their relationship, I have no right at all to tell this couple that they can not enter into this union.   \n\n",
        "After reading the discussion starter and pondering this topic over the course of this research project, it occurs to me that there is no legitimate reason why gay marriage should be outlawed.\nThe only valid argument that could be used against gay marriage is the danger of ending procreation altogether, which would only happen if everyone in the world were homosexual and never procreated.  However, this argument is meaningless unless being homosexual turned out to be dependent on personal choice alone.  In recent times, as research into the “gay gene” looms ever closer, the chance that homosexuality is dependent upon one’s genes and not one’s personal choice is getting greater and greater.  Even without the “gay gene,” one can not say a person would choose to be gay for any good reason.  First, it is against physical nature (the parts only fit together one way).  Second, to declare oneself as gay in this world is accepting a life of possible mockery and hatred.  Fortunately, this is not as much of a worry in our world today as it was a half century ago.\nAs it is shown that being homosexual is not one’s choice,  one’s sexuality becomes an impersonal trait, just like gender or skin color.  For anyone to discriminate against someone based on this kind of trait is a crime and should never be practiced.  Thus, there should be no difference between opposite sex marriage and same sex marriage.\nInstead of legalizing same sex marriage, one solution that has been suggested is to allow homosexuals to get married and call it something else.  This solution is a insult, a slap in the face, against homosexuals and should not be practiced.  To refer to a homosexual marriage as another term is to acknowledge the discrimination that exists and is causing the problem in the first place.  It is getting around the problem and not solving it - shutting up a discriminated population to create an “easy fix” in our society today. \n\n",
        "Pricavy; the right to keep something confidental, private, and secret. It is the right to be left alone. It is the right that allows people to be their true selves when left alone. it has been said that privacy is the foundation on which this country was formed. Issues of privacy have gone back to colonial times in this country. People would have to sneak off into the woods or into an open field to chat privately. They could never talk in their crowded homes and towns for fear of eavesdroppers. The Fourth Ammendment states “The right of people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and siezures, shall not be violated, and no warrents shall issue…” Although this is clearly states, privacy have been violated from the very beginning. When in the age of telegraphing, these telegraphs could be interceoted and read very easily. From about 1900 to 1965 when operators had to manually place calls, the opersators could listen in to any conversation and they could tap phone calls with just a clip of a wire. In today’s society, there is no privacy for public figures and celebrities. Photographers snoop through any papers and pictures they can find and go to where they think these people will be just to get a glimpse of them eating a hamburger. These pitures are then published in tabloids and sold all over the country. I believe that the only reason that avergae American, like myself, still has some privacy is only because no one really cares what I’m doing on a day to day basis, whereas the public is very interested if Brad and Angelina are adopting tomorrow. If they did care about what I was doing, it would be easy for them to come to my school and follow me around. Also, because of the recent terrorist attacks, privacy is one of our freedoms that may have to be sacrificed in the near future. For this reason and this reason only, I think it is valid for the government to tap suspicious phone calls and things of that nature. If it is for the safety of the nation, I have no problem giving up this freedom. \n\n",
        "In my big-mouthed, pretentious opinion, the global “war on terror” is one of the most ill-conceived political notions I’ve ever heard of. It was a hasty response to America’s post-9/11 fears, and was meant to restore faith in the U.S. government at a time when people felt it had failed. They wanted to give us something to rally around in a time of crisis. September 11th truly hit home for us; for the first time since the cold war, Americans felt tangibly affected by political crisis. The “war on terror” was a vague, half-assed response to this.\nWhat exactly is “terror”? Exactly what, and who, are we fighting against? What does terror look like? Does it always wear a turban? Does it always have distinguishable qualities? Is it just an emotion, or is it embodied by specific people? A war against the dictionary definition of “terror” (an emotion) would be fought by psychiatric professionals, right? The fatal ambiguity of our “war on terror” is that IT MAY ONLY EXIST AS A SECONDARY CONCEPT, WE MUST FIRST DEFINE TERROR!!\nSo who gets to define terror? Obviously somebody messed up when they defined “terror” as “Iraq”. Obviously, the executive branch had an agenda in mind before it even looked at its intelligence data, and it interpreted all such data accordingly. The entire intelligence community, as those who often take the fall for ill-decisions at the top, must have been really pissed off when those at the top IGNORED intel conclusions that Iraq disequals Al-Quaeda.\nWe aren’t talking about some chickenshit political fiasco, we are talking about the ENTIRE military and economic might of one of the greatest countries in the world. If we are going to fling that muuch power around, we BETTER know EXACTLY who, what, where, when, why, and how its going to happen, or else the international community will decapitate our legitimacy. The war on terror simply does NOT, and has NOT, satisfied these things. \n\n",
        "I cannot see a good reason why marijuana should remain illegal, or a criminal offense. There are far less detrimental effects from marijuana use as compared to alcohol. This not only applies to health concerns but also to actions of the user while under the influence. If there were to be a couple of strong regulations (similar to alcohol) it would be perfectly safe to allow the distribution of this virtually harmless drug.\nOne may argue that marijuana smoke damages the lungs. This may be the case, but then you must also present a strong argument against cigarettes. There have been no known cases of lung cancer tied to marijuana use. Also, with cigarettes, there are many people who smoke a pack a day. Though one marijuana joint contains the equivalent amount of tar as several cigarettes, most users do not smoke this much too often. Also, in comparison to alcohol, the health issues are very minor. It is nearly impossible to overdose on THC, whereas with alcohol we see frequent cases of people being hospitalized due to excessive consumption. Then there are long term health risks associated with alcohol such as addiction, liver diseases and even damage to the brain.\nNow how about people under the influence of marijuana, as compared to alcohol. Drunk people have a tendency to make poor decisions. This can either be driving a car, picking a fight, etc. People who are “high” tend to avoid these kinds of situations (due to an increased paranoia as well as relaxed feeling). You never hear about a high person getting into a fatal car accident, but for drunks, this is more frequent.\nThere is virtually no reason to keep this drug illegal. It is safer than alcohol and cigarettes and most of the harsh opinions of it come from outdated beliefs. By legalizing it not only would you create less criminals, but it could also create a strong economic source (thanks to taxation). Of course, to legalize it you would have to put restrictions on it as well to keep it out of the wrong hands. \n\n",
        "I absolutely support the legalization of marijuana. The reality is, pot, in many ways, is no different from alcohol. In fact, it’s probably safer simply because you can’t kill yourself from overdosing, the way you can with alcohol and many other drugs. Certainly there are risks to using any drug, and there would have to be restrictions put upon activities such as driving, but allowing the use of a small amount of legalized pot would do the world no harm.\n             I have a personal interest in marijuana being legalized. A majority of my close and lasting friendships, from high school through to college, began, or were nurtured, through a common bond: marijuana. I’ve met a lot of people after someone asks the question, “hey, want to smoke?” Some might consider this shallow, and my friendships unhealthy, but the reality is, I’ve never met a group of people as close as my friends. We’ve stuck together through break ups and people moving away, through college and fights. I can go to any of my close friends for advice on anything, and we can talk intelligently about sports, politics, philosophy, and a whole number of things. If given the chance, we could certainly disprove many misconceptions people may have about youth who smoke marijuana.\n             Marijuana should be legalized because its affects are similar, and probably milder, than those of alcohol. Marijuana cannot directly kill you, unlike alcohol. And although I have not personally driven stoned, many of my friends do so on a regular basis and have never once encountered any problems. Marijuana is a social drug, just like alcohol. My best friendships have been born from a common interest: smoking pot. All of us are attending major universities of repute, all of us excel in athletics or academics, and none of us have ever been imprisoned or reprimanded for any sort of misbehavior. Marijuana, in moderate amounts, would be great for American society. We all need to loosen up a bit.\n\n",
        "There seem to be several economic and social advantages to the legalization of marijuana.  It would be taking money and power out of the hands of drug traffickers and providing more revenue for the government.  Also, based on the example of other European countries such as Holland, where the rate of young adolescent usage of marijuana is lower than in the United States, legalizing the drug would take away the thrill of rebellion, and hopefully the overuse and abuse of the drug.\nThere should, however, I believe, be laws that regulate the right of a person who consumes marijuana to operate a vehicle, something analogous to the laws that regulate drinking and driving.\nI think it should be noted that marijuana receives a lot more attention than it may deserve.  I read an article in the newspaper the other day about sleeping pills and the harmful effects that were being discovered.  Certain pills caused people to get in their car and drive while asleep, equally if not more dangerous than driving drunk or high.  Yet these pills remain legal forms of medication, and there is no great public outcry against them. \n\nIndeed, if people in the United States are legally allowed to slowly kill themselves by smoking cigarettes, I don’t see why they shouldn’t be able to smoke pot.  The difference is, however, the amount of research done on the effects of each of these substances.  I agree that a greater amount of studies needs to be performed before the legalization of recreational marijuana. \n\nI’d just like to make another point about the nature of legal implementation.  As is the case with alcohol and cigarettes, I think that there should be a minimum legal age for using marijuana.  Although, just as there have been political debates about the proper drinking age and the proper smoking age (in New Jersey just last year, the age was raised to 19), there are bound to be a number of disagreements over the minimum age for using marijuana. \n\n\u001a",
        "When thinking about the government looking at my records, i think of people who I know who work for the government. When I look at it in this aspect, it reminds me that the government is made up of regular people who everyone lives amongst. Isn’t the guy next door who works for the government looking at my private records kind of the same thing as the person on the other side of my house who isn’t a government employee? Sure, the government employee has more of a right I’d say, but it still creeps me out…\nFor the companies that look for medical records, etc.- I think that that’s a poor way of going about business, but they DO need to look out for themselves. I really can’t have an opinion on this section of the topic, because a lot of people do lie about their health, etc. to get something they want. Companies can’t keep losing money over people who screw them over…On the other hand, I know of a lot of people who do not follow the same paths as their family within health issues- so these people do get the bad end of the deal.\nI do feel that if it involves the risk of someone else, companies included, then records should be privately distributed- with sincere confidentiality. I believe that the people finding out the information should only find out the bare minimum of what they have to know and then can’t distribute that little bit of information. Cases in this would include a partner of someone with HIV/AIDS, or a company looking into giving somebody a sort of health plan.\nWe can’t have people in our society be ambitious enough  to lie about their medical history, etc. in order to better themselves while at the same time causing other people their jobs.\nThe government really is here for our safety, or at least I am brainwashed to think this way….:-/…. This is just a glitch in our history as other things in the past which have caused discriminatory actions. I’m not sure when, but the future will most likely bring laws that will please just about everyone on this topic- after this, I feel that this topic will no longer be as big of an issue. \n\n",
        "While I do feel that gender discrimination still exists in certain areas of today’s society, I think that we have definitely come a long way towards improving things.  In terms of the “feminism” movement, personally I agree with the fact that this movement made more sense a few decades ago.  It used to be that it was assumed that women would just stay home and be housewives, taking care of the children.  Now that most women are just as likely as men to pursue higher education, I feel that there is not much of a need in society for this sort of a feminist movement.  For those people who feel that men and women need to be equal in ALL regards, I disagree.  Men and women are physically different, and as a result, there are certain instances where men are just better suited for the task at hand.  For example, while some women might be up for (and perfectly capable of) being in the police force or soldiers in the armed forces, in most cases, men are better suited for these jobs. \nRegarding the corporate and academic worlds, I believe that women and men are equal in terms of their capabilities.  There is no reason why women should receive different salaries than men for performing the exact same duties.  While I think that men and women are able to perform at equal levels in the business world, I also believe that because of the discrimination that some women face, this can impact their ability to advance in their fields.  What I mean to say is that if there are certain male coworkers who look down upon the abilities of female employees, this could potentially impact the ability of the female to perform her duties to the utmost.  An example of this could be if managers see that the female employee does not have the respect of her male coworkers, these bosses might be less likely to promote the female to a management position, even though she has the necessary skills.   \n\n",
        "Certainly the 20th century has brought a great deal more of conflict dealing with gender discrimination.  For the most part, it would seem, females and males were comfortable in their roles up until the events in the middle 1900s.  The movement to abolish gender discrimination is just as necessary as was the movement to end slavery and other forms of discrimination.  Whether you are a woman, a black person, a handicapped person, or any other person who has some sort of “physical difference”, that is by no means sound evidence to base discrimination on.\nThe 20th century, and now the 21st century, has seen a large push to unveil these discrimination and diversity issues:  companies have enacted diversity boards to oversee the diversity management and hiring of their workplaces and educational institutions have started affirmative actions plans to give the “tiebreakers” to the minority.  All of these steps are certainly necessary and are starting to change the value of diversity in this country and across the world from worthless to invaluable.\nDealing with the feministic movement, in particular, the reasons for erasing the prejudice are just as sound as erasing other forms of discrimination.  Having more females in upper management positions within companies or higher up position in an education institution allow a more rounded viewpoint on the best interests of those respective institutions moving forward.  How can a marketing firm truly meet all of the market segments without a sound female in an upper management role to see that the 50% or the market she has great knowledge on is best represented?  In only makes sense to put females, equally with males, in key decision making roles because their diverse thoughts will bring new perspectives and new ideas to the table that can only benefit in brain storming sessions and otherwise.\n\n",
        "The legalization of marijuana, although not one of the biggest issues in news today, is causing commotion throughout the country. Marijuana has been used for medicinal reasons in some states, and this has opened the door to talk of a more widespread use for the substance.\nFirst off I see no reason why marijuana should not be used for medicinal purposes. In cases such as cancer and terminal illnesses, if marijuana could make them more comfortable and ease their pain then it should be used.\nOn top of this reason, I don’t see why it should not be legal to be used recreationally. Compared to other drugs such as cocaine and LSD, marijuana has not been shown to have nearly the same effects or health risks. Furthermore, marijuana is natural, so compared to even cigarettes; it does not hold the same deadly chemical in a cigarette.\nSome of the arguments against marijuana are that we would be faced with the same problems as alcohol such as drinking on the job and driving while under the influence. If marijuana was legal we would be faced with these problems in the same way as alcohol. There are people now who drink on the job and get away with it, so that would still be a risk. Also, I think that many people are already using or have used marijuana even though it is illegal. The law against it doesn’t seem to be keeping many people from obtaining it.\nI feel as though marijuana should be legalized. The only flaw to this is that if it were legalized the government would have the power to tax it. Therefore, it would become more expensive to buy and those who are already selling it might continue to sell it. There would have to be strong regulations from the government if they don’t want there to be other people selling it. \n\n",
        "Gender discrimination is still a problem in the world today, but has decreased significantly over the past few decades.  There is still the fact that in scientific studies, some companies will more often hire someone with a gender neutral name like Sam or Casey than someone with a clearly feminine name like Maryanne, and how on average women are paid 70 cents to a man’s dollar.  However, any companies treat men and women equally in hiring, pay and promotion, and it is a much smaller number of unfair companies which throws off the averages now.  Fairness in hiring and promotion has come a long way and continues to do so due to laws which have been put in place to prevent women being taken advantage of.  Companies know that when these laws are broken lawsuits are not usually far behind, because women today are very aware of their rights and want to be treated accordingly.  Even in sitcoms and other TV shows, the trend is toward women and men being in equal positions of power.  The pattern in the United States today is moving towards fairness and equality in the workplace.\nI think that most gender discrimination now happens once women enter the workplace, and doesn’t necessarily come in the form of being passed over for promotion or having an inferior salary.  The movement for gender sensitivity has been much more prevalent recently than the movement for gender equality – now I hear more about women being upset about how they are treated as a person by their peers than how much they are paid.  Often something like a snide comment about how a woman’s body looks in a skirt or a certain shirt can make the workplace a very uncomfortable environment for a professional woman.  I think the concern nowadays is to have women feel comfortable working in the offices and companies they have not too long ago earned the right to be a part of.  Fortunately, companies are cracking down on this kind of behavior.  Often a man will have to attend gender sensitivity training to learn how to interact with women professionally, and if his performance repeats the company might feel him enough of a liability to take away his job.\n\n",
        "People in this country can’t even get over the fact that humans come in different colors and shapes. There is discrimination EVERYWHERE in this “land of the free and the home of the brave”, along the lines of race, gender, sexual orientation, body type, and a myriad of other factors. If you need proof, look at the racial, genetic, and area wage gaps in our supposed “land of golden opportunity”. The LAST thing we need is to add another discriminatory quality to our list of prejudices.\nHumans don’t get to choose the specifics of the body/situation they are born into. We have even less control over what our genetic makeup will be! If we are to start discriminating along the lines of DNA, we will be LOSING all the potential that those with “bad genes” have to offer. Society would be hindered if we denied opportunities to those people; they undoubtedly have just as many essential ideas/capabilities as genetically “normal” people do. Besides, whether or not someone is genetically predisposed to a certain kind of cancer has NO BEARING on their ability/inability to actively contribute!\nWe have gotten along just fine WITHOUT genetic discrimination, and I’d bet that a fair number of society’s most active benefactors wouldn’t have been allowed to be such if “genetic” tests were a reality. We have SERIOUS class issues in America. There is already enough inequity and injustice in this country. Wide spread DNA testing would only accentuate these class issues, giving those who “pass” even more undeserved entitlement than our rich and powerful already have, and giving those who “fail” even less to start with than our currently marginalized. This would just give our nuveau-riche one more reason to bask naively in their own greatness.\nIs someones’s “health risk” potentiality a sufficient condition for denying them opportunities to thrive? Are our corporate health insurance premiums really so important to us that we are willing to preclude ALL persons with certain genetic characteristics from participating in society? If so, that disgusts me. If DNA testing is made a reality, it will just illustrate our society’s declining community values, and reinforce our “American” tendency to label ourselves “exceptional”. This is one of the most self-serving, trashy, and disgusting ideas I have ever heard. If it goes through, I will lose a LOT of faith in our government’s ability to effectively serve its citizens, and gain a sense that our politico-economic power structure is really just serving itself. \n\n",
        "How the hell is gender discrimination any different from ANY kind of racism?  A woman and a man can do the exact same thing.  It drives me crazy when people separate it.  And it happens both ways sadly.  My family is full of stay at home moms, but they would never expect me to stay home just because I’m a woman.  Yet, I’ve seen numerous families where that exact thing happens.  You would never see a father telling his son to stay at home and raise a family.  Countless girls have told me “Oh I’m just in college so I can work until I get married.”  It’s insanity in my mind.\nI get that gender discrimination has been around as long as civilization, but that doesn’t mean we can’t change it.  Just like with any other kind of racism, it can be stopped or at least changed with the effort of man.  We claim as a civilization to be “open-minded” but this just proves that we really aren’t , this is just something we just can’t get rid of.  We can’t get away from the thought that women can only be mothers and wives, or the idea that men have to be the bread winners.  Even today when we routinely have men staying home with the kids and women going into the workplace, it’s not really accepted.  It’s looked at oddly, it’s looked at…as strange, almost as wrong.\nIt’s funny, every time that I tell people that I might never have a family, because I don’t see it fitting in my career plan, I get the oddest looks.  When a man says that he has a career path with no room for a family, he’s looked at as a driven young man ,and a woman is looked at as an oddity.  Scares the crap outta me. \n\n",
        "The Christian bible has a great number of stories which contain moral lessons, and as such, it is a valuable book to study. After reading the bible, we are supposed to love our neighbors, understand each other, be generous, act with love, and in turn, address many of society’s ills. While the Church has provoked a great deal of human suffering over the years, these lessons have also inspired a lot of good. The lessons in the bible are implicit, however, rather than explicit, and in the process of interpretation, they are all too often lost. Today, opportunistic post-Constintinian Christian politicians use their “convictions of faith” as a tool to increase their “appeal” to “faithful” voter populations. They hawk their “views” on issues such as abortion and gay marriage in exchange for single-issue “moral” votes. In turn, they try to polarize discourse over these issues into those “for” and those “against” the church, while not publically calling attention to MUCH MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES (global warming, petroleum dependency, etc). This is the sad state of affairs to which American Christianity has been reduced: a coercive marketing tool that drives our political machine toward polarized paralysis and drives ordinary citizens to clash with each other, sometimes violently.\nI know that the Church wants to provide static traditions which do not die/change over time. Such consistency is a NOBLE goal. However, the world is constantly changing. Humanity is currently faced with an apocalyptic global warming crisis, terrifying global power-money politics, institutionalized racism, perpetual wars, suffering, and death. In order for the Church to retain any of my respect, IT NEEDS TO MAKE ADDRESSING THESE THINGS ITS FIRST PRIORITY. With more than just a papal bull or two, with overwhelming cries for social justice in a world which has left justice behind. If the Church doesn’t act to proliferate good in the world, it has lost sight of its original mission.\nIn terms of self-preservation, if the Church wishes to be a viable entity in contemporary America, it can’t cling to its antiquated views. I, like Frankie, do not care what the Church does. However, if the Church still wants to be around, it might have to stop being so stubborn… or else it will lose touch with many of its followers (cafeteria catholics etc). \n\n",
        "At this point, there are so many people already using marijuana that the benefits of legalizing the drug outweigh the harm. To make production of marijuana standardized would make it safer, because there would be a far smaller chance of other harmful materials being cut into it. The government would benefit from being able to tax it, and the police would have more time to worry about crack dealers and murderers rather than arresting teenage kids found with a bag of pot.\nThe effects of marijuana on the body are something to worry about, as with any drug you want to make available to large numbers of people. But from what I’ve heard, marijuana is very similar to alcohol. Impaired memory, coordination, concentration, and reflex are symptoms common to both marijuana and alcohol use. The only things left to know are whether it is possible to overdose on marijuana like it is on alcohol, and what its long term effects on the body and brain are. Because of the similarity I think marijuana should be used in similar situations to alcohol: recreationally, after work, and not before driving.\nThe danger of increased DUIs is what concerns me most about legalization of marijuana. If the drug is made readily available, I feel there is an increased probability that people will do it more often, leading to a better chance that they will be high when driving. DUI laws concerning marijuana will have to be modified once it is made legal to consider a legal level of intoxication like the commonly accepted .08 BAC level for alcohol, and a way of measuring the amount of marijuana a person has consumed would have to be developed. Also, a legal age for consumption like 21 for alcohol or 18 for tobacco would have to be commonly agreed on.\nAt this point in time, I see too many advantages to the legalization of marijuana to be ignored. The drug is so similar to alcohol that legalization would probably not be a huge hassle. Standardization of production and retailing it in stores would lower the danger people purchasing and consuming marijuana now might encounter. Taxation would allow the government to profit from its sale, and better regulate its production. Although marijuana smoke has been proven extremely harmful to the lungs, as long as cigarettes are still legal I see no grounds for denying marijuana legitimate status in America. \n\n",
        "            Debates over laws that forbid certain kinds of marriages are not unique to our generation.  There was also a time in U.S. history when a large number of state governments outlawed marriage between African Americans and Caucasian Americans.  These laws, based on discrimination and injustice, were eventually abolished.  I can’t help but feel that the exclusion of gays from the institution of marriage is simply another form of discrimination that must be done away with as well.  And I think that the rulings in Vermont, Massachusetts, and New Jersey that have legalized civil unions (in Massachusetts, marriage itself), have started a trend that will continue to spread to other states.\n            There’s no such thing as an ideal family, and there’s certainly no such thing as a typical family.  What is important is that children grow up in safe environment where they are loved and supported – it doesn’t matter who is doing the loving and supporting.  And yet, too often adoption agencies refuse to allow gay couples to adopt children together.\n            How can someone argue that the purpose of the institution of marriage is procreation when so many couples choose, when they get married, not to have children and use various forms of birth control to ensure this?\n \n            I have of course been discussing marriage in its legal sense, as a part of secular society.  The Church, as so many Americans gladly boast, is separate institution from the entity of the state.  According to Roman Catholic beliefs, the one of the purposes of sex, which should only occur in marriage, is procreation.  Therefore not only does the church not allow gay marriage, but it also forbids the use of birth control (other than natural family planning).  I feel that critics of the Catholic Church often use the recent priest scandals as an excuse to attack any principle or doctrine of the Church.  Yes, these atrocities deserve all the amount of horror, outrage, and damnation that they have received and perhaps some more.  But the actions of imperfect, fallible priests should not take away from the teachings of the Catholic faith itself. \n\n",
        "Personally, I am opposed to the legalization of marijuana.  I don’t really have a strong argument to defend my position, but basically, I don’t feel that the government should make it easier for its citizens to use drugs.  I understand that marijuana is not addictive and it has not been proven to have the same sort of long term effects as other drugs, but it is still a substance which impairs the body and can be abused. \nWe already have problems with drunk driving, so I don’t feel that we should legalize another substance which could cause impairments that would lead to accidents on the road.  I know that people are going to do what they want to regardless of whether or not marijuana is legalized, and that there already are people driving high, but I don’t think that we should help increase this number by legalizing marijuana.\nI feel that right now, many people who smoke marijuana do it for the “thrill” of using an illegal substance, but since it is not addictive, this does not prove to be that harmful.  However, if marijuana were to be legalized, this thrill would be gone.  I believe that some people would then no longer be satisfied using only marijuana, and therefore would look to try some other drug (which would likely be more harmful).  I am not necessarily citing marijuana as a current “gateway” drug but I think that if it were legal, some people who previously only smoked marijuana (and used no other drugs) would take things a step further and try something else.  \nOn the other hand, I believe that the discussion starter brought up a very valid point about the economic ramifications of the sale of marijuana.  As I stated previously, people are going to smoke marijuana regardless of whether or not it is legal.  If it were legal, the industry would be under some sort of govermment control, instead of being underground.  This newly legal industry could provide many job opportunities, and the profits from sales would also then be counted in the US GDP.   \n\n",
        "On the whole, I feel that the right to privacy is one of the most fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.  When it comes down to the battle between freedom and security, I think Benjamin Franklin said it best when he said “Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.”  We should be able to, as citizens, conduct our business and do what we want (within the restrictions of the law) without fear of being monitored by the government.  On this point, fine lines cannot be drawn.\nHowever, when it comes to genetic privacy, the lines are a little harder to see.  Sure, health insurance companies shouldn’t be allowed to see information about your family history, in order to either deny you coverage or raise your rates, but if there is genetic information that you are withholding, sometimes the fault is in your hands.  By this I mean, if you are applying for a high stress manual labor job and fail to tell your employers that you have heart problems (god knows why you would take this job if you had heart problems, bear with me) then how is this any different than withholding from your employers that you spent the last five years in jail, or that you are pregnant?  The point is, when you are applying for a job, your employer wants to pick the best person for the job, and does not want to pick someone who is more likely to have a health problem or just not be the right person.  This isn’t genetic discrimination, this is simply economics.  If an employer chooses a male over a female simply because he’s sexist and doesn’t think a female can do the job, that’s discrimination.  If he picks a male over a female because the female is six months pregnant and can only work 2 more before leaving for a year on maternity, that’s not.\nAm I trying to say that all our genetic information should be made public? No.  But finer lines have to be drawn and regulations must be made before taking any more steps towards the release of our DNA information.\n\n",
        "Gay marriage is a topic that has become very important in our society today. Now more then ever we see same sex couples in our communities. So what is it about these people that make them different? Personally, I think that Gay Marriage should be legal in every state in the United States.\nScientists are learning that being homosexual might actually be a genetic difference. If this discovery turns out to be true, there will be no reason not to allow gay people to marry. Not allowing them certain rights would be like not allowing marriage to people with blonde hair. A genetic difference is no reason to oppress a person.\nReligion is another speed bump on the road to acceptance of homosexuals. In the Catholic faith they have accepted gay people as people, but they do not condone the lifestyle that they have chosen. Although we may never see the acceptance of homosexuals in the church, there are a lot of changes that can be made in government to help.\nArguments against same sex marriages argue that there is no real reason to be married. But why are same sex couples being denied the same rights of heterosexual couples? The only rule for marriage against heterosexual couples is that they must be eighteen years of age or older in order to be wed. Why are there any more restrictions on same sex couples? They should be granted the same rights as everyone else.\nNow, same-sex couples who are not allowed to be married are still living together and adopting children. Marriage would allow for these men and women to raise a family in a more conventional way. Although they would not be able to have children of their own, adoption would allow them to still have children and be parents. Marriage should be available to everyone. \n\n",
        "i don’t think that gender discrimination exists in the sense that the term previously stood for.  what i mean by that is that i dont think that the majority of the population (or at least in the united states) views women as a lower demographic or lower caste. gender issues will always exist… i mean, unless humans become asexual, there will always be the basic (as well as the subtle) differences between a man and a woman, and those differences will need to be worked out differently as society changes. just like we’ve adapted to the times with previous issues - albeit sometimes the process was very slow - we will forever need to continually adapt our views to update with the realities of the current society.\ni think there is not a very strong argument for why working women would detriment the family values of America.  similarly, i don’t think there is any argument at all for why men should be removed from household completely.\nto begin, the argument that “few women seem attracted to men who engage in [childrearing and domestic tasks] to the detriment of their careers” is a clever and highly misleading one.  of course women don’t want a man who does these thing to the detriment of their careers.  any person - man or woman - wouldn’t want their spouse to be overly involved in anything that hurt their career.  This is not to say that the family should not be a prioirity before work - as a matter of fact, i think it should always be a priority before work - but the wording of the argument is very loaded and assumes that men that spend time with their families do it to a fault, or are overemotional.\nas for women being “too work-oriented”, thats just plain discrimination.  a balance can be reached where both the man and woman can work and be at home - my parents did it, and you don’t have to look far for extra examples. \n\n\u001a",
        "I am all for same sex marriage. We live in a secular culture, we obey secular laws, and we do not reference the bible for every decision that we have to make in our lives. But for some reason we as a culture are sitting back and allowing our president to use the bible as the reason why same sex marriages should not be allowed in our country. I was a member of SAGABA in high school, which stands for the straight and gay and bisexual alliance, I met some of the most passionately in love men and women I know. So what if they were in love with members of the same sex, love is love is love no matter what the sexual orientation is. Does the idea of a man and a man living together really still scare our country? The topic of homosexuality has been raised in the media, on our reality television shows, and even with our very own vice president. When a show called the real world has seven cast members and every season at least one member is gay, doesn’t that say something about “the real world,” or at least how our society perceives it. Gay parents are perfectly capable of providing a safe and proper home for raising a child. It is my belief that an adopted son or daughter can flourish just the same with same sex parents as he or she would in a traditional household. If the love is real than the sexual preference should mean nothing. Our President holds his high Christian morals in very high regard. Undoubtedly growing up in Texas our president most likely had a slightly slanted impression of homosexuals. I know I am stereotyping a state an to be honest just a region of our country in general, but its tough for a southerner to see eye to eye with per say somebody from California or Massachusetts.\nThere should in no way be a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. The constitution lays the constructs on how to make our country a safe and efficiently run democracy. It does not tell us who to marry or what is moral. The constitution is not the bible and it does not contain “God’s word.” Therefore our president needs to stop quoting the bible as his reason for being so opposed to same sex marriage. I do not care one way or another if the bible describes marriage as between a man and a woman. Not every American is Christian and not every American is straight. If certain states want to ban gay marriage then legally there is no recourse to stop them. On the same hand if a state, such as California wants to legalize gay marriage they too should be able to do so. To make such a controversial issue with no clear cut conclusion into a federal law would be premature and unfair to a great percentage of accepting Americans. \n\n",
        "While I agree with the two privious posts on some points, on others, I find it very difficult to argee with. Yes I believe that I too am of very little significance to the world in that my life is not as glamorous to watch as Brad Pitt’s, and that I find it very disrespectful for poporatzi to follow these famous people around and snap shots of every little thing they do. In Europe, I believe there is a law about this, and that the laws in place to protect people of fame are more heavily followed and carried out. However, when it comes to the aspect of monitoring everything I personally do, I am not to sure I agree with this point.\nThe Patriot Act is said that help protect our nation from possible terrorist attacts in the furture. This is great in my oppinion, but what happens to all of those other people who were listened upon in order to catch the terrorist? I guess one could argue that what they dont know does not hurt them, because those listening in on conversations no longer have to announce to the speakers they are their because the government has agreed to this, but what if you could never have any time to onesefl ever?\nI this act starts to remiend me of that book “1984” by George Orwell, where “Big Brother” was always watching. Pretty soon if we are not careful what ends up happening in the book will happen in real life “for our protection” of coure. We will be having telivision monitors in our every room that also act as cameras to watch what we are doing. We will only be allowed to do certain things, such as write for a certain amount of time before we have to stop, because otherwise we could be cooking up a plane to destroy our country. Like in the book, we might even be required to attened group meetings where we all chant together and say how much we hate our attackers, and while this last point may seem un-intruding, it really is, because it is intruding into our thoughts and words. We are being told what to say and think, which is a form of privacy being taken away (our own thoughts and words).\nAlso, most often the people who are being monitored are those of a certain desent, such as mussulem. This is not right for this group of people to be singled out and monitored for “suspicious” behavior. A normal english looking white guy could be just as corrupt as the true terrorist, yet we are not paying him any mind, because we don’t think he is a threat because his skin is not dark enough. This is all blandergash! One should not have to deal with more of thier privacy being taken away simply on the basis of skin color, or nationality. It is in a way almost lumping all of these people togeter, like we did during WWII to the Japanees, only now we are lumping the together and not telling them even this…yet they are still bound like the Japanese were.\nAll in all, I belive that privacy is extreemly important, and that if one can not act and be a part of a country without trust then we as a nation have a problem. \n\n",
        "Gay marriage is a difficult subject for many people, because there is no way to solve the problem and make everyone happy. I myself am very torn between the two sides because I grew up in a very religious household and was raised on Biblical principles, however, I have made many good friends who are gay and I would want them to be happy. On one hand, there is the Biblical approach to the issue in that many people believe homosexuality is morally wrong. But on the other hand society has come very far from being based on anything remotely Biblical so why not allow gay marriage?\nI do think that the issue of gay marriage should not be one of national concern, but rather of individual states. I do not think the nation government should be allowed to make the decision one way or another since there is so much controversy over the issue. I think doing this would make more people happy and be more accommodating. Also, banning gay marriage or legalizing it altogether would cause chaos and riots in the streets because there are so many people who feel very strongly about both sides of the issue.\nI do not think that procreation is a valid enough reason to band gay marriage. Like the article said, couples who are infertile or past the age of being able to have children are still permitted to marry, so that completely invalidates this reasoning altogether. I do think that if gay marriage is legalized, they should be civil unions and not so much marriage since marriage is defined as the union between a man and woman. Also, because marriage is supposed to be holy union and is recognized as so Biblically and it will be a very difficult task to get many churches to perform marriages between same sexes.\nEven though our society has come very far in broadening its ways of thinking it still has a long way to go. \n\n",
        "Although it is not nearly as bad as it used to be, I do think that gender discrimination is still prevalent in today’s society. For women, we see it all the time in the media as well as in the work place. Sexual harassment is still an ongoing issue; often times women are not given the respect they deserve from the men the work with, especially if they hold a higher position. In the media, women are still portrayed as sex objects and companies typically only use beautiful and sexy women to sell their products, as if they will appeal to the general public more than and average woman or even a man. A great spin off of gender discrimination against women would be the NBC television show The Office. All of the dominant characters are men, and all of the female roles are dependent on men. One of the women, Jan, who is the boss of the main character and head of the office Michael is thought to be a strong and successful woman, but her main role revolves around the fact that she is sleeping with Michael. The show seems to depict women as not being able to survive without a man, which I think is a complete fallacy and unfair portrayal. Although these examples do show the ugly side that still exists in society, it has come a very long way in improving the lives of women. Women are able to achieve much more success than they ever have been able to in our country’s history, and we are much more advanced in our beliefs of gender equality than many other countries.\nOn the contrary, I do believe that men suffer some inequalities as well. Many companies that are trying to compensate for past discrimination against women favor hiring women over men, which gives them an unfair advantage. Likewise, women have a better chance at getting accepted to colleges than men, especially engineering schools because of the deficit of women in that field. There is also the stigma against men who pursue careers known to be predominantly female, such as nursing or secretarial work. Pursing the fields is looked down upon for men and considered “sissy”.\nSo discrimination goes both ways. \n\n",
        "Is there really a reason to refuse marriage to gay couples? I can’t see one.  Most homosexual couples aren’t asking for a religious marriage, they are asking for the legalities allowed to heterosexual couples.  As it stands now, people in a homosexual relationship can’t share in a partner’s benefits from work, and have no claim to their partner should something terrible happen.  Sometimes it even seems like by denying even a civil union to homosexual couples we are undermining their very existence.  It seems like we are saying they don’t deserve the right to the same type of life as heterosexual couples.  Another argument used against homosexual “marriage” is that they can’t have children.  Well if that’s the argument, should we allow those couples that don’t plan on having children to marry?  And for that matter, heterosexual couples that cannot have children should not be allowed the status of marriage.  When we discriminate against one group we end up discriminating against everyone.  Personally I think the argument over this “issue” is ridiculous.  Homosexuals aren’t different from anyone else, so why should there be laws saying what they can and cannot do.  Sometimes I feel like the laws are being made to shut up those few people who disagree with a lifestyle choice.  The people who have no problem with homosexual couples aren’t going to make a ruckus, so they aren’t heard, they are drowned out by the yelling of a relative few.  No one should be punished for living their life the way that makes them happy.  Denying gay couples the right to a union is denying them happiness, and that is denying the very basis of what our country was built on.  Our forefathers may have been puritans but they left an oppressive government for freedom, freedom for everyone.  Not just whites, not just Christians, not just heterosexuals, everyone. \n\n",
        "The Catholic Church is so different from other Christian religions in that it can be very strict and unforgiving in its policies.  Many of these policies are rooted in tradition, but are not applicable to a modern society.  The Catholic Church needs to loosen up its rules and be more accepting of new ideas, instead of clinging to old ones that do not necessarily fit in the modern world.\nOne example of such a problem is the requirement of the Catholic Church that priests be celibate.  This is a policy that is not rooted in scripture, but in tradition.  This may have been beneficial in the past, but seems really outdated in today’s world.  By asking priests to remain celibate in a world where the majority of people are not, the Catholic Church is separating its priests from the rest of society.  This contrast between priests and the rest of the world shows that the expectations of the Catholic Church are not consistent with the expectations of society.  The church should work in harmony with the society it serves, and not counteract it by advocating different values.  It does not fill well into modern society to require the celibacy of priests, and this is an area where the Catholic Church is very outdated and needs to make some changes.\nAnother area in which the Catholic Church has unrealistic views is in requiring priests to be males.  Today’s world promotes gender equality, as there has been a consistent movement towards the acquisition of women’s rights.  Society is trying to promote acceptance and tolerance, and in some ways the Catholic Church is doing this, but it other ways, it is shutting its doors based on outward representations, such as gender.  Not allowing females to become priests is undoubtedly a form of gender discrimination, which counteracts nearly every other movement in society which is working towards gender equality, especially in the workplace.\nThe Catholic Church has much room for improvement if they want to fit in with the society they serve and the society which serves them.  Religion exists for the people, but if people are living lives vastly different from the lives which the religion advocates, the people will not be able to fully experience their religion.  It will be beneficial for both the people and the Church itself for the Catholic Church to loosen its stringent policies and become more in-touch with the modern world. \n\n",
        "Gay marriage seems to be one of the biggest debates these days and I really can’t see why. There are much more important issues at hand, such as the war yet all many people seem to focus on is gay marriage. However, since this topic is on gay marriage I guess I will explain my views.\nIn all honesty I cannot say that it is fair to leave this decision up to the federal government or even the state government. Marriage is a sacrament, not a nation endorsed celebration of the union between two people. With this said I think that it is in our best interest to let the decision making on this topic reside in the church. There is a little something known as “separation of church and state,” which some of these politicians seem to be forgetting. Not all churches will agree on whether gay marriage should be allowed or not and it’s not up to the government to make that decision for them. If it was up to me I would do away with the governments roll in marriage and enact some other kind of civil union that a person must get alongside marriage to be recognized as a couple. Not to be difficult, but just to keep the government out of the church.\nIt could be argued that the government should have some say because there are benefits given to married couples. Come on though, would it really make that much of a difference if a minority of people were allowed to have those same benefits without being spiritually connected to someone of the opposite gender? While of course it would be physically impossible for them to reproduce (at least with our current technology), there is still the option of adoption. They would have the same situation as any heterosexual couple and would deserve all of the same stipulations.\nThen there is the big one. President Bush’s attempt to get a new amendment put in place that specifys marriage as between a man and a woman. Not only is this completely contradictory of another section in the constitution, but it is also a horrific display of his seek for power. If passed, this would be the FIRST amendment to actually RESTRICT THE PEOPLE. The intentions of the constitution as well as the amendments were to prevent the government from infringing on the rights of the people. Now he wants to introduce something that will completely go against everything already said? Something that should NOT happen.\nSo to sum everything up, I am pro-gay marriage as long as the church agrees. Churches should not be forced to ban it nor should they be forced to accept it. However, the overwhelming hype about this subject is just ridiculous. \n\n",
        "From participating in this study I have learned a few things about the war in Iraq and various individuals’ opinions on the war. Yet, even with this knowledge, I am still much uninformed. I may be uninformed about the war because it never had an immediate impact on me, and therefore I did not take an interest in following the headlines. When I think about the war in these terms I feel that we are taking the right course of action by having our troops in the Middle East. I would prefer the fighting to be kept off of our land and away from our homes and loved ones. When I place myself in the shoes of those whose loved ones are fighting, I have a very different feeling. If my brother or someone I loved was fighting in the war, I would want President Bush to bring the troops home IMMEDIATELY. So, my opinion on the war changes depending on the impact it has on my family and I.\n            My friend John attends West Point Academy; after his four years of college he will serve five years, most likely somewhere in the Middle East. I have known John for many years and I can not imagine him at war, I can not even imagine him holding a gun. When I talk to John, he never complains, saying he chose to be in the military and will go wherever they place him. John rarely tells people that he attends West Point because he fears how some people will react to him. He fears a person’s response to his chosen occupation, but does not fear going to war. I may not know everything about the war and the issues surrounding the topic, but I do know that a person in the military should never have to hesitate or dread telling someone they are in the military or training to be in the military.\n            Concerning the war in Iraq, I think that to an extent society has lost track of their priorities. Instead of condemning the war and those fighting, we should be fully supportive of all those who are there to protect us. People should be able to have their own opinions about the war, but I do not think they should cast doubt on those fighting in the war. \n\n",
        "Despite the number of laws mentioned in the discussion starter, laws intended to promote equality between the sexes in the workplace and in the educational system, there exists a great disparity between the number of men and women in certain career fields, and in some of these fields it is very difficult to find a women in a top-level position.  My dad is an engineer, and he has often commented about the lack of women in his field, especially women in positions of power.\nObviously certain ideas persist in America about the academic abilities of men and women, especially when the president of a university such as Harvard can declare that women can’t do math or science as well as men because of “innate” differences.\n \nI do feel however, that gender discrimination exists against men as well, and that this is often overlooked.  Girls used to be the members of the elementary school classes who received less attention from the teacher, or whose wrong answers were excused.  But I think that in a lot of places, an attempt to correct these kinds of teaching practices has led to overcompensation, and that boys are now the ones suffering.  Look at the statistics of the students who attend college today.  On most campuses throughout this country, girls are in the majority, and Loyola is no exception.  Yes there are studies that show that in general boys and girls learn and develop differently.  But there is so much variation simply from one individual to the next, and this is how teachers should treat their students, looking at them as individuals.\n \nI would agree that a certain stigma exists against women who want to be “just” wives and mothers; at least, this is what I gather from my own experience.  I attended an all-girls private high school, and it was completely taboo to make any other plans except for attending the best college that you could get into.  We students had to maintain the college attendance rate of 100%.  Meanwhile, what one of the smartest girls in the class above me really wanted to do was start a family.  This was her goal and I think it’s just as important and just as essential as a woman who wants to be a scientist or a lawyer.   \n\n",
        "I believe that it is crucial for the church to change. People must remember that the church was established over a thousand years and stories of Jesus were written over 60 years after his death. the times have changed. I am not saying that the church should change what they believe in because then catholicism would not be a religion, I am simply saying that the church must become more open - minded and realize that times have changed. Being a catholic myself, I feel like I represent how the majority of other catholics view the church. I think that it is somewhat narrow - minded and I don’t like that all decisions are left to be decided by one man. I do not believe in the hierarchy that the church has established. Due to the fact that the church was established over a thousand years ago the church needs to be revamped and become the church of the present day. Unlike Jesus’ time, women now have rights, we do not stone people anymore, and equal rights is a huge part of our society. I feel that women would make wonderful priests and that the church is only hurting itself by not allowing them to become such. Already the church is lacking priests, allowing women to become priests would only benefit them. However, at the same time, I see how this could be somewhat contradictory to what the Bible says. Although is it not to be taken literally, it is clearly stated that women should not be ordained priests and that the idea of having only male priests was based solely upon the 12 Apostles. Again, this took place in a male - dominated society so it is a tough call. I believe that me, being a young, catholic woman who believes in the more liberal aspect of the church, has the same views of others my age. I am for women’s rights and I believe that the church must be updated. We are long overdue. \n\n",
        "The current issues facing the legalization of marijuana, I feel, are not enough.  The same issues that are brought up against the legalization of marijuana have been brought up against our other legalized substances as well such as alcohol and tobacco products.\nSome would suggest that there are a slew of health problems that should prevent the legalization of marijuana; however, I am not completely convinced as to the legitimacy of this argument.  At school and at other times throughout a child’s development he or she obtains numerous classes on the negative effects of alcohol and cigarettes but the part dealing with marijuana is either non-existent or quite vague.  Perhaps this could work for or against the legalization, but I feel there is simply not enough known about the effects of marijuana.  Since this drug has been around for several decades now, perhaps that is a good sign.\nFrom personal knowledge of people who have experimented with the drug, it does not tend to be used as much as the other two aforementioned drugs.  With a relatively higher cost, economically speaking, consumption is forced to be lower on average.\nThe legalization, whether it is in small amounts or not, could also have some general positive effects for society.  From an economic point of view, this would create more legitimate jobs and perhaps additional tax revenue for the municipality.  Additionally, some crime associated with the use and sale of this drug could be ceased because there would not longer be a penalty for such offenses.  Violent acts would not be necessary in the day to day dealings of legal drugs.  No one has ever heard of a violent drug bust over cigarettes or alcohol.\nWhile certainly there will still be problems with any other drug once legalized, ultimately it should be up to the individual human as to whether or not to consume.  The society in question should set an appropriate age minimum to consider some level of maturity, but then it is up to the individual to use their rights and, hopefully, moderate their use of the drug just as moderation is championed in many other aspects of life.\n\n",
        "My theory on Iraq is that we are all in agreement that we have made a huge mistake, now we just have to focus on fixing it. Obviously many people, including myself are not happy with the way the current president is trying to run things, and I feel that really we just need a whole new group of people in the government with fresh ideas to help get us out of there. I understand that if we pull out now, it would be horrible because they are not quite ready to stand on thier own, but I feel as if we should be pulling out more then we are, to get them slowly acclimated. IF we pull out too soon then it could be disastorous though b/c then it could turn into a situation like when russia pulled out of afganistan too soon. Personally i feel, again, that our best bet is on a whole new administrative in the govt. who will have fresh ideas on how to get us out of this mess.\nWhat I find is funny is that we went over and are fighting in Iraq when the people who bombed us during september 11, were not even from there! They were from afganistan. So yeah…nice of our pres to start a war with the wrong country and masking his own desires to capture sadam by using september 11th as a cover up.\nI am glad though that we are not, as a country, make the same mistake that we did during the vietnam war in blaming our soldiers for this horrid mess, because it is not their fault. We need to keep up our suport behind them but unit on trying to get them out of there! \n\n",
        "Gender discrimination has become one of the most troubling issues of the 19th and 20th centuries. In America, we have come far in many ways to lessen the tension between the two sexes. In other countries, the gap between men and women is much wider. This is based upon social ideals and traditions in these cultures.\nThe feminists of our time, although not battling the same issues as those who came before them, are fighting very important battles. In some workplaces, women are still not shown the same respect as their male coworkers. The equal pay for equal jobs idea is not always followed, especially in some high level jobs. Women are also currently fighting over the idea of abortion. There are groups of women who believe that they should have the right to decide, pro-choice, for whether or not they would like an abortion. These women believe that it should not be up to the government to make decisions about their bodies.\nThis discrimination is not just limited to women. The stay at home men of our time are becoming more and more prevalent in society. These men, often referred to as “Mr. Mom” are the stay at home “mothers” of the 21st century. No longer is it seen as ridiculous for a woman to be the one to go off to work. Also, men are discriminated against in the way that they look at women. Often, as a group, being called “sexist” or “pigs” men seem to be accused of many faults towards women in general.\nIn many aspects of life, gender discrimination has come very far within the last century. It is no longer seen as absurd that a woman can vote, or hold a job. Although there are still some areas to be conquered, and we could never change the personal views of every person, Americans have come very far in closing the gap between genders. \n\n",
        "Four years ago, when the US originally invaded Iraq, most of America didn’t know anything about the country.  Most people knew it was in the Middle East, which was the same area that the 9/11 terrorists originated, and we believed what we were told: that this would be short war with remarkable results for our country’s safety and economy.  Even now, half our country can’t find Iraq on a map.  But now at least the majority of our country is in agreement that we made a mistake in entering.  Theres little use arguing in hindsight over motivations for entry or political corruption; now that we’re in, we need to figure out how to get out.  Sure, we could spend time and money to impeach the president and start afresh, but its so late in his presidency that it would just be a waste.\n Surely, Bush will not back down.  He believes strongly in this war, for whatever reason, and theres really no budging at all until his term runs out.  Hopefully our next president (with our new congress) will takes steps in the right direction.  And my personal opinion is that the first step should be withdrawal.  Its time to reverse ”diplomacy is dead,” because now war has failed and maybe its time to show our enemies that we are a compassionate country, not an imperialist one.  Not only is continued occupation taking a toll on our soldiers and economy, but a recent survey of Iraqis showed that the majority of their country opposed occupation and found reconstruction efforts minimal and insufficient.  Perhaps it is time to give them what they want and leave.  We can still support their government and country without forcing democracy on them.  Simply put, democracy does not mix well at all with Islamic countries.  It is a western ethic that doesnt mesh with the values of their religion and has been proven again and again not to work.  Lets stop trying to Americanize the middle east.  And the first step towards that is the removal of our troops from their country.   \n\njust to make some comments on what ive heard people say…\nyes, we need to support our president.  if a country isnt united we simply arent strong and are even more susceptible to attack.  However, we voted for a president, not a king.  the presidents primary function should be to serve and protect his country.  if he doesnt have the support of his country and doesnt do what the people want him to do, than how is this a democracy?  we act like we are spreading “freedom” to the middle east but i dont think we even know what that means.  in basic democratic theory, if a leader isnt serving the people then the people have the right to revolt and depose of him.  i agree this isnt the right thing to do right now, but if we dont voice our opinions and concerns, what kind of democracy are we?  the fact that we can “not support our president”  is a real demonstration of freedom and is a much better option than just blindly supporting whatever measure of shit our president gets stuck in.\nto comment on the medias role in all of this…people tend to believe that the media has a negative slant and doesnt mention the positive things about this war.  oh wait, thats right.  were in a war.  war isnt positive.  if 200 people die everyday in a war, whats the positive part? that we moved our forces a little bit?  please tell me what the positive things are because im really interested.  and dont bother mentioning saddam.  if you enter a small country with a ridiculously superior force and dont manage to capture or kill the only nameable enemy you entered to find, then maybe you should stop invading countries.  oh wait. hold up. thats what happened in afghanistan. we went in to find bin laden (the actual terrorist behind 9/11) and OH NO WE STILL HAVENT FOUND HIM.  besides this, however, 58% of Iraqis recently polled have found reconstruction efforts to be minimal or nonexistent. so what are we doing in here? have there been positives?  please inform me.\nso, im sorry if i offended anyone with my sarcasm.  however, i just watched bush give a press conference on the war on terror and it reminded how much i cant wait for the next election. \n\n\u001a",
        "The discussion starter for privacy rights seems to be different from previous discussions we have had about privacy. Instead of focusing on the internet, we are now focusing on more significant topics where privacy should be a concern. The discussion starter had a few valid points, especially about the privacy of health records. Last month I was in London and read one of the English newspapers. One of the headline stories was of a young woman who was recently diagnosed HIV positive. She had been dating a man for some time and he never told the woman he was HIV positive. To make matters worse, he requested to not use a condom. The woman agreed and lost her virginity to an HIV positive man. This man was of Italian citizenship and immediately fled the country. English officials were able to bring him back to England to face charges. I do not remember what the exact charges were, but his genitals were considered a dangerous weapon. Just as a gun could kill, so could his man parts.\n            I believe that health records should be open to the public in cases like this. Because laws can not always be made for “if this, then that” situations, privacy rights should not be as strict when it comes to health records. This man knew he was HIV positive and would pass on a death sentence because there is still no cure for AIDS.\n            To address some of the other topics- if you do not want companies to give away your personal information, just do not give it to them! I was shopping in the Gap last year when they had a special 15% off for those who joined the Gap club or something like that. I was filling out the required information until the form asked for my social security number. Now, my mother does not give out our home phone number, so I was not about to give out my social security number. Because I did not give the number, I was unable to join the club, but I did what I felt would protect my privacy. We just need to adjust to the way society does things and do what we can to feel safe. \n\n",
        "I believe that gender discrimination is absolutely still an issue in the United States today. A few years back, I was writing a paper, and as research, I wad required to find the mean salaries for white men and white women. The difference was jarring: even though our higher academic institutions are now more female than male, white men still made an average of $10,000 more a year than white females ($40,000 to $30,000) the difference between black men and black women is also $10,000 dollars, $30,000 to $20,000). Thus, even though more women are getting degrees than men, it means that either men are making more for the same jobs, or that men are holding more higher paying jobs than women- and a quick glance into a corporate board room across the country will tell you that the latter is most definitely true.\n            Another area where it is easy to see gender discrimination against females is in the ongoing debate about whether or not Hilary Clinton has what it takes to be the next president. Almost every article is prefaced with the question “is America ready for a woman president?” There mere fact that this question has to be asked is a pretty glaring example of very blatant gender discrimination. The insinuation, of course, is that a woman brings something different, something perhaps inferior, to the table than a man does.\n            Of course, discrimination can certainly swing both ways. There are certain professions that men still get strange looks for taking. You don’t see many male hairdressers, or many male nurses (the movie “Meet The Parents”) comes to mind when Robert DeNiro makes fun of Ben Stiller’s character for being a male nurse). If anyone admits to being a hairdresser or a male nurse, he’ll often be asked, well, why? And there’s always an underlying insinuation that maybe, he’s gay- which, of course, in our culture is emasculating.\n             Gender discrimination is alive and well in America. It’s seen in the discrepancy in salaries between men and women, it’s seen in the popularity of men’s sports over women’s sports, and it’s seen in the fact that this country has not had, in 200 years, a single serious female candidate for president- even though many European countries have long since had female presidents or prime ministers. There are cases, too, of male discrimination, but the issue is much less serious, and often comes from jobs that are viewed as too “feminine.” \n\n",
        "I think these issues on privacy rights have to be considered on a case by case basis.  It is important to know when people are trying to help you.  For instance, the NSA monitors phone conversations (in Washington, D.C. I think) to help spot terrorism and plans to assassinate the president before they occur.  They have a computerized system that listens for key words like “bomb,” “plane,” etc.  They do not have operators that sit and listen to phone conversations of ordinary citizens.  First of all, there are far to many calls for that to happen, and second of all, the government just doesn’t care about non-threatening phone conversations.  This operation exists because it protects us - not because the government wants to monitor the lives of everyone in the U.S.\nAs far as national ID’s go, I think people will always find ways to beat whatever system is in place.  Even in the age of social security cards, birth certificates, and drivers’ licenses, it is still fairly easy to create a new identity.  Given enough time and money, anyone can make fake ID’s.  People make counterfeit money with very advanced counterfeiting machines despite the best efforts of the Secret Service.  For this reason, I don’t think national ID’s will solve anything (in the long term, at least).\nMedical information is something that needs to be highly protected.  If such information gets into the wrong hands, people can find themselves fighting for their reputations.  If some CEO, for example, contracts HIV, and that information gets out without his consent, his company and his reputation will suffer.  I do think that the system we have set up now is quite adequate - at least in hospitals - to protect people’s medical information.  I work as a hospital pharmacy technician, and only essential medical personnel can view a patient’s medical information.  A patient’s medications are locked away in a drawer in order to prevent privacy violations.\nI think those systems which utilize personal information for the good of the people should be continued, but private information should be highly guarded in all other cases. \n\n",
        "It should not be a surprise for me to say that the Iraq war has not turned out like many of us thought, including President Bush.  The objectives were to remove Saddam Hussein (which was accomplished) and eradicate terrorists from Iraq (which was not accomplished).  Like the article stated, terrorists flocked to Iraq from surrounding areas in order to bring the fight to the U.S.  This was undoubtedly a critical oversight by the planners of the war.  However, President Bush, Congress, and the presidential advisors do not have a crystal ball with which to tell the future.  They only have bits and pieces of intelligence from a finite number of sources.  I’m sure they received intelligence that suggested the presence of WMD’s and a link to Al Qaeda.  That does not necessarily mean that such information was accurate.  They decided to invade Iraq because they believed that the danger was too great to ignore.  I cannot fault the decision makers for trying to do their jobs.  Could they have made a huge mistake?  Sure, but who among us does not make mistakes?\nEven though the Iraq war cannot be called a success, some good things were accomplished.  Saddam is dead, his sons are dead, and many Al Qaeda leaders are either dead or imprisoned (i.e. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed).  I don’t think many people understand just how oppressive Saddam’s regime was.  Saddam, whose hero was none other than Joseph Stalin, had close to absolute power over the people of Iraq.  He had an extensive secret police force that he used to snuff out dissent - meaning that whoever publicly opposed him was tortured and/or executed.  Moreover, Saddam has used WMD’s of the chemical variety on the Kurds in the northern part of his own country in the 1980’s when they aided the Iranians in the Iran-Iraq War.  In light of these circumstances, it is clear that Saddam’s regime was intolerable. \n\n",
        "While it isn’t nearly as apparent as it was around 50 years ago, Gender Discrimination still does exist. While there have been many laws created to try and eliminate it and our culture has grown more gender-tolerant, there still lives this tendency to discriminate on a sex basis in the mind. As little kids we are bombarded with insults such as, “John plays baseball like a girl!” This is harmless enough on the surface, but when we are constantly reminded that “girls aren’t as good at baseball as guys,” it must have SOME sort of impact on the way we think in the future. Fair enough, as we grow older we drop some of these silly ideas and begin to look at things the way they are, but still there lingers this idea in the back of our minds.\nI have never been to fond of sports myself so I could not accurately say that “male basketball players are much tougher than women basketball players” but I can say that I’ve heard similar remarks made. Sure, they could just be sly remarks that one male will make to another seeking a resulting laughter, but all in all it is still one way that we can see some sort of discriminating. Just the fact that there is some motive for that remark to be made in relation to gender is enough to show it. A similar issue would be these gender jokes. I hang out with pleanty of guys, and enough guys to have heard a couple dozen women jokes. I can’t say that I’m innocent and have never told one either. Though most people do not tend to think much of what they are saying when they tell them, but are really just looking for a few cheap laughs, these images can be disturbing.\nLooking past the non-physical level of discrimination and on to something jobs, we are presented with another problem. There are more and more women getting out into the workplace alongside men, which is good, but there are still statistics out there that show that there is discrimination with pay, positions and other things, whathaveyou. Many of these companies are run by old white men waving flags for the Republican party’s darker side. Hopefully at this rate these tyrants will soon be out of power and a newer more tolerant generation will be running the businesses. Many of the people in the higher ranks now still have the image of the stereotypical 1950’s family in their minds. Wife in the home, husband at work.\nHow about discrimination towards men? Most people would scoff at this question. It isn’t nearly as big of a problem as it is towards women, but it is out there. There are a handful of women who think of all men as ungreatful swine who are the bane of humanity. Then there are stereotypical images of men that some women carry. One of these images is of a man sitting on a couch with a beer in his hand and the football game on. Not all men are like that, obviously, but just like the stereotypes exsist for women, they also exist for men.\nSo all in all, yeah, gender discrimination does still exist. Not always towards women, but moreso than it is towards men. It is improving, thankfully, but it still has a long way to go. Not all of the change is in the realm of physical objects. For the most part what we need to change is our own mindset.\nOver and out. \n\n",
        "the issue of gay marriage is definately one of the most controversial subjects of society today, and equally hard to have a solid stance on the matter.  the arguement does make sense that marriage represents a man and woman union because its “natural” and that they can biologically have children and start a family, but just because gay couples can’t naturally have kids does that make them have bad morals?  i don’t think so — just because they have a relationship with someone of the same sex doesn’t make them “evil”.\ni think if society accepted gay people into the community, the concept of gay couples as parents wouldn’t seem so extreme.  the concept of gay parents as “farming gay kids” - not my phrase - is also ridiculous; heterosexual parents raise kids that turn out to be gay all the time, so why shouldn’t the opposite be the same?\nhowever, if gay people are given the right to marry, i wonder what other groups of people previosly unable to get married in the way they want would push more strongly for their rights.  i don’t think this is necessarily a big issue, but it would be interesting to see if polygamous people or other groups would start to say, “hey, if they can get married, why can’t we?” either way, once the system ‘lets down their guard’, i think other groups will take advantage of the situation.\nalso, civil unions are really just marriage light.  marriage shouldn’t be defined by the state in regards to any religion’s definition, so really the only difference is the tax benefits as mentioned in the discussion starter post. if the government is going to give gay couples the right to civil unions, they might as well go the full nine and give them the right to marriage. Catholics can still define marriage as strictly between a man and woman - they shouldn’t care what the govenment defines it as. \n\n",
        "Okay, I’d like to clarify something before I go forward. Everyone harps on the idea of “papal infallibility” as being one of the most ridiculous things the Catholic Church ever dreamed up (and it very well might be), but it’s frequently misunderstood and misrepresented. Papal infallibility is a doctrine that can only be invoked in regards to a point of theological dogma. If the Pope said, “The Yankees are a really good baseball team,” he’d obviously be wrong. From what I remember from my days in high school theology class, the doctrine of papal infallibility has only been invoked twice, on two specific, separate issues.\nThat said, I agree with Mtnbike9 on all of his points below. I have an uncle who is a Catholic priest, and know for a fact that many priests are under specific orders to stay quiet about any or all of those issue that were raised. We have to remember that the Catholic Church doesn’t just exist in America; it’s ruled by a hierarchical system who’s top is located on another continent. The social attitudes and ideas one finds in America don’t necessarily hold true in the rest of the world, and certainly don’t hold true in Vatican City. I think that this is one of the biggest reasons the Church hasn’t (and probably won’t, at least for a while) made any major changes in the way they go about their business.\nI think that the Catholic Church stands to lose a huge amount of its members in the United States. According to a 2002 poll, about 23% of US adults identify themselves as Catholic (that’s a much larger portion than I would have guessed). We can probably expect this number to drop steadily over the next couple decades as more and more people seek what they feel to be less restrictive forms of Christianity. That is, unless the Church decides to change.\n\n",
        "The Catholic Church should recognize that the world is changing and they should change with it because whether they want to realize it or not the older generation is dying off and the new generation is a sex-crazed generation. We’ve grown up with sex; sex has gotten to the point that it’s even in g-rated movies. Also the whole notion of women not being allowed to be priests is another reason why they are having so much trouble, I mean why are they keeping women subordinate to men, these aren’t the old days, women can be as great of a priest as men can. Hardly anyone is going to want to be a priest if they can’t have sex; it’s gotten to a point that we are expected to have sex at some point in our lives whether we want to start it at an early age or wait until we are married.\n \nAlso I understand what the rest of the reading is saying but they also don’t want to lose a valued numbered of priests and parishioners all because the church wants to be stuck in their traditions. Maybe if they waited a little to make sure that it’s not a growing trend across the country and the world. Because what many seem to forget is that Catholicism isn’t just here, it’s all over the world so we have to look at the fact that our younger generation may be changing but others may not. I feel the church also needs to target the youth, a lot of catholic sermons are very dry and uneventful, not to say that they need to be as exciting as Baptist churches but the reason so many people get into Baptist sermons are because they are speaking on issues that affect their parishioners in their everyday life.\n\n",
        "By all means, marijuana should be legalized everywhere. There are several reasons why I support the legalization of marijuana. First and foremost, as long as alcohol and cigarettes are legal to own or consume, marijuana should be legal as well. It is extremely hypocritical for any nation to legalize alcohol and cigarettes while keeping marijuana illegal. Alcohol has short term effects, such as nausea and a severe impairment of your judgment and coordination, and long term health risks that are deadly, such as liver disorders. Consistent heavy consumption over long periods of time can also lead to alcoholism, a disease which causes physical dependence on alcohol. Cigarettes have infinitely many proven health risks, many of which are able to be seen on Truth commercials every day. Aside from the short term effects of throat irritation and shortness of breath, cigarettes can cause cancer in almost every organ of your body, heart disease, and respiratory disease over longer periods of time. Also, nicotine causes physical dependence on cigarettes. On the other hand, marijuana has minimal side effects, and most of which are not proven. Marijuana smoke is worse for your body than cigarette smoke, but the typical individual smokes more cigarettes than marijuana in any typical day. Also, marijuana has no physical dependence. Scientists say marijuana is “mentally addicting,” but mental addiction really lies within the individual. Anything can be mentally addicting to anyone, and it does not have to be a drug to cause mental dependence. Second, marijuana also has many medicinal properties that would be more accessible to the ill if it were legalized. Marijuana has been proven to help fight the effects of glaucoma, and is used in hospitals to stimulate appetite amongst AIDs patients. Third, if not legalized, marijuana should at least be decriminalized as soon as possible. Overpopulation in jails has become a major problem as of late, and a big factor in this is the people in jail who are there solely for marijuana charges. While it may be illegal, smoking marijuana is not an evil act, and certainly does not justify jail time as a punishment. \n\n",
        "I am a member of the Roman Catholic Church, and have been raised all my life following it by two devout Catholics as Parents. I know the Church’s traditions, and go to Church basically every Sunday…I’m not as conservative as the Church, in fact, I am basically a moderate with general conservative views. I really hate the idea of the Church changing, because I am someone who hates change in general. Yeah, I guess you can say that I have that attitude talked of in the discussion starter- “if it ain’t broke, then don’t fix it.” The way I figure it is that if it’s a religion, then you shouldn’t change it based upon what people want (as opposed to need). Am I saying that the Church doesn’t need more people preaching? no. All I’m saying is that the Church made room for men by making them priests and made room for women by making them nuns. Nuns take a vow of joyful service, so they should enjoy what they do and be satisfied with it. I don’t think that anyone should be telling the Church to allow for women to be priests because I feel that the Nuns should be the only people doing that.\nWith Priests being able to marry, the Church views them as having a sort of “marriage” with God, with the regular people being their children of God (hence the reason for us calling priests “Father…”) Would I feel that it would help the Church if Priests could marry? Yes and No. I feel as though it would increase the numbers (as with letting women become priests), of devout members within the church (children of priests [men or women possibly] are sure to be devout members).\nI love the idea of the Church expanding, etc., but I also love tradition- which is one of the main values that the Catholic Church is run by. I hate the idea of following peoples wants to modernize it to suit their wants…\nWhen talking about how the Church isn’t attracting the youth at all, that’s crap. I went to World Youth Day in Germany a few years ago which had wow….either 1.3 or 3.1 million people at the ending mass (i realize that those are two numbers which are nowhere close to each other, but they’re both huge)…John Paul II, obviously one of the best things to ever happen to the church, reached out to the youth, and through him many youth have gotten involved in the Church. I know of 18 year olds who are going to become priests which also gives me hope\nI don’t know if the whole shortage of priests bit is exaggerated or what, but I don’t see a need for the Church to change at this moment…\n",
        "I agree with clockwatcher555 that allowing women to become priests will not solve all of the Catholic Church’s problems, but I disagree on principle. They cite tradition as one of the reasons the Church has to be careful in changing things around – I think tradition needs to be reevaluated n its importance.\nThere is something to be said for the stability of religion, how it can remain constant from year to year even when major events are changing the face of the world. People rely on religion for unchanging morals and beliefs in an unstable world, and that is as it should be. Tradition is a huge part of religion’s foundation, and is integral to most of the laws and practices of any religion, not just Catholicism. However, when traditions are followed blindly out of habit rather than for the value they add to the religious experience, they become a burden and cloud the real purpose of the faith.\nI think the major crisis in the Catholic Church today is that many of its traditions have become so ingrained that they are vehemently defended even when they no longer make sense. The case of women not being allowed to be priests is a good example of this. Any argument the can be made for keeping women out of the priesthood has its basis in the tradition of the Catholic Church – that’s the way it’s been done for 2000 years, Jesus never had women apostles, popes throughout the years have always banned women from priesthood. However, these traditions were founded in a society so much different from ours today that it can hardly be compared. Middle-eastern, patriarchal, and placed 2000 years in history, it is amazing that most of the traditions and practices of the Church have stayed so intact. Perhaps it is time for tradition to get a rational review from an outside perspective.\nThat being said, I don’t think we should just throw out traditions that clash with the values of our society. Frogger428 is completely right, the Catholic Church doesn’t just exist in America. “Catholic” itself means universal – the Church has branches in every continent. Before we can say “this should change!”, we must have a general consensus and listen to all sides of the story. \n\n",
        "Privacy rights have certainly become an important issue that we need to deal with in our lives today. Privacy rights are involved in many facets of our lives, from medical records, to national security, and everywhere in between. It is important that we are protected; however we do not want our rights to be suppressed.\nWith the new technology in our world today, we do not have the privacy that we think. Our cell phones, computers, and other devices of communication are open to the world. On the computer, anything that you do, whether it is through e-mail or a website such as facebook, can be seen by anyone on the internet. Our phones are also not as safe as private as they used to be. In an effort to keep our country safe, many of the calls that are made or received from overseas are being tapped. This effort is a step in the right direction, however is it infringing on our rights to listen to our everyday conversations?\nFrom a medical aspect, a patient’s privacy rights are very important. Medical information to a patient is only seen by those who they want it to be seen by. Often times this information may been needed to enroll in a school, or to apply for a job, but these institutions are bound by laws also to not release the information to anyone else.\nPrivacy rights are a way in which to help keep the people of our country safe. In many cases, if the person is doing nothing wrong, what does it matter if their moves are being monitored? Still though, some feel as though it is there right to keep things private. We need to be careful of the information that we put out into the world, because we can never be completely sure who can get their hands on it. \n\n",
        "In my personal opinion, I do not feel that the Catholic Church needs to allow women to become priests.  There is already a shortage of women who want to become nuns, and I don’t really think that THAT many more women would enter the religious life if they could become priests.  (If a woman REALLY feels called to serve the Catholic Church, then she will likely become a nun.  I don’t know how many women are so deterred from the religious life just because they can’t be priests.)   \nI do, however, believe that priests should be allowed to marry.  As stated in previous posts, this has worked for other Protestant religions.  As I understand it, the reasons that the Catholic Church has for requiring celibacy is two-fold.  1.) Jesus was not married, so priests should not be either and 2.)  Having a wife and family could detract from priestly duties.   I feel that the contrary is actually true:  a priest who is married and has a family would be able to better connect with the church community because he could better relate to the majority of the congregation.  And I don’t think that Protestant ministers are any less devout because they are married.\nOn the subject of the Catholic Church changing its ways, I feel that they need to be very careful in making those decisions.  The Catholic Church prides itself on being grounded in tradition, so to just change things all around would take away from this.  On the other hand, I believe that there are certain changes that DO need to be made.  The Church has gone through all sorts of changes over the ages.  There have been different councils and meetings where the leaders of the church have decided on certain “laws.”  Since the traditions of the church are essentially man-made, I believe that, within certain reasons, there is need for change.  (Since the laws were originally made by humans, I feel that if it will help the Church keep its numbers up, some changes can be made to adapt to current society.) \n\n",
        "The issue of privacy is a very important one to our society as the line between what is and is not acceptable has gotten increasingly blurred. In most cases, I think that everyone is entitled to privacy and to disclose only the information they feel comfortable with. However, if this information is harmful to them or other people, I think they have no right to with hold information. In the case of the woman who unknowingly contracted AIDS from the man who’s intention was to infect her, I definitely think that the man’s medical records should not be kept confidential and should be used against him. He was obviously using his disease as a weapon and had little regard for other people.\nIn the cases where genetic discrimination occurred, I think it was unethical for employers and insurance companies to look at people’s medical records. In this case, having a problem genetically is no one else’s business, especially if it is not harmful to anyone else. These people were treated unfairly based on something they have no control over. By invading their privacy, they were discriminated against in the same way many people are based on race or religion. Medical records are supposed to be kept confidential and by looking into them, businesses are completely disregarding personal space and rights. This should only be allowed with the consent of the person they are looking to investigate and whatever they find should not influence their opinions of the person one way or another.\nI feel like these days so many people are just out to use your personal information against you, you can’t really trust anyone with your information. Even for my job, we are told to try and get donations on credit cards rather than through mailings because it’s less of a hassle. However, many people are reluctant to give out their credit card numbers because of the risk and vulnerability you set yourself  up for. And any information given to us is completely safe and secure, but many people are distrusting because it seems only bad things happen when you give out your personal information. I think that businesses and even the government need to learn to keep their noses out of the things that do not concern them; if no ones life is in danger, then they have no right to anyones personal information without their consent. \n\n",
        "So obviously, I am against gender discrimination.  You can’t really be for discrimination in our day and age without getting yelled at for it.  But there does still exist, even if subconsciously, gender stereotypes that often don’t allow women to “make it” in todays business community.  However, a certain balance must be found between allowing equal opportunities while not giving women more chances and opportunities than males.  Thats right, in many different situations today, there are cases of reverse discrimination.  This is not the direction we want to take our country. \nA lot of this “more power to females than males” is coming from feminist activists who are so proud to be woman that they forget that we are all people.  One of the worst of the bunch is Mary Daly, who believes in thecomplete seperation of males and females in todays society, and would go even further to say that the planet would be much better without males.  What kind of insanity is driving this woman?  I completely agree with female rights but all you ladies out there, feminists are making your gender look like idiots!  be proud to be a woman, be proud to be a human, but just because youve been scorned to by too many a man in your life, dont take it out on all of us. \nSomething else that needs to be considered in the gender debate is the role of the woman in the family.  Many women want to get as far as they can in the business world but at the same time want to have a family and children.  While I absolutely believe that woman should not face a glass ceiling because of their gender, we have to look at the situation from another point of view: that of the children.  Shouldnt the child have the right to have a nurturing mother and family?  Think how screwed up kids are gonna be in half a century when they are raised by their housekeepers and nursery schools and never have much contact with their parents.  I’m not saying here that women shouldnt be allowed to have high paying jobs if they are going to have kids, but a balance has to be made and priorities have to be established.  In this regard, I don’t believe that pure equality between genders will ever be reached.  I believe there are fundamental differences between men and women and that men and women should play different roles within the families and thus never exactly be equal.  However, we should try as hard as we can to reach the best equality that we possibly can.\nThis is obviously quite a rambling discussion on gender discrimination, but seeing as the issue itself is not easily defined, i guess it is okay. \n\n",
        "http://www.genome.gov/10002328 (i believe this is a clearer representation about what the starter was trying to say on genetic discrimination.)\nthere are pros and cons to any new technology (ask a history buff to explain the industrial revolution if you don’t believe me). that being said, one of pros *and* cons of new security technology is that it’s easier to get a hold of private information online. i would consider this a pro because patrolling online sites (such as Myspace) leads to the arrests of pedophiles and other disgusting people. however, since the patrol of these sites is much more common now (for a good reason), you simply have to be a little more careful with the information you decide to put online. personally, i have no problem giving up a little privacy/freedom for the common good…\ngenetic discrimination is another story. i actually wasn’t aware of this issue until i read the starter’s post, so i decided to do a bit more research on the subject. basically, nowadays you can get genetic testing done to see if you are genetically prone to a certain disease/diseases, and knowing that ahead of time can help you plan for the worst. however, this information is held in your permanent medical record, and some people with predispositions to certain awful diseases (such as cancer) are being discriminated by employers and insurance companies. now, insurance companies are already known to be evil (proof -> http://www.blackchapman.com/html/v16-1a.htm), but employers not giving people jobs because you might get cancer or another disease? thats just…not right. from what i’ve looked at, it seems like getting this kind of genetic testing done is a very good idea, especially if you’re trying to prevent getting a disease you think you might be predisposed to. this kind of discrimination would obviously turn people away from the idea. on the other side of the fence, what medical information should be allowed out in the open? once again, refering to the starter post, i would definately want someone who has unprotected sex without telling their partner they have HIV to go to jail for being ‘reckless’ at the least. it’s just another example of the gray area surrounding privacy and new technology. i foresee that as long as new technology exists, new versions of these conversations will continue to pop up. \n\n",
        "Right now, the I don’t think the United States could handle the legalization of marijuana. Our current prohibition has brought us to a place where legalization would cause a BOOM in use. I’m not confident that our society could exercise moderation/self control right away, especially considering the impression of “novelty” which has come attached to its illegality (e.g. when teenagers rebel by doing “illegal” things), which wouldn’t necessarily disappear with legalization. This being said, pot puts a HUGE financial strain on our legal system… arrests, bookings, hearings, court fees, probation periods, and the like rack up a HUGE price tab. We must ask ourselves if our moral crusade against pot is worth the price tag of enforcement. To many Americans, including mostly all of my family, it certainly is. However, law enforcement agencies spend a whole lot of money/time chasing teenagers with weed while more serious crimes are being committed (and unaddressed) in other areas.  I’m not advocating municipal tax redistribution; I’m saying that the obscene amount of money spent on pot enforcement might be allocated better elsewhere.  What would that money do if it were spent on chasing rapists, muderers, or child molesters?  Is marijuana inherently evil to the point of being on par with these crimes?  I think that violent crimes deserve our attention more than pot smoking.  While I think legalization would be a step to far, I have heard some very convincing arguments for the DECRIMINALIZATION of marijuana.  If it were decriminalized, getting caught with pot would be more like a traffic ticket than a formal arrest.  Decriminalization represents a certain middle ground in this argument - we can cut down on enforcement costs yet simultaneously retain its illegality.  However, decriminalization might not satisfy those who adamantly oppose marijuana on moral or religious grounds.  They would say it is insufficient.  I suppose what it all comes down to is a few questions: does the government have sufficient power to decided what is and isn’t moral?  Is marijuana a social ill which threatens our society and truly requires an appropriate response?  Do the costs and benefits of marijuana enforcement weigh out sensibly?  Is marijuana’s illegal status a permanent thing, or will society eventually revisit this issue? \n\n",
        "The issue of privacy is definatly a critical one. It is a hot topic especially when it comes down to a concern for security. While it is essential that we keep a close watch for any possibilities of misdeed, we also have to remember where to draw the line. It is important that we do not allow any possible threats to be carried out and it is nearly just as important that we do not invade on people’s rights guaranteed by the constitution. One big issue that has recently come up is that of public internet servers such as myspace.\nThe keyword there is “public” as opposed to “private.” Since all of somebodys actions while logged into myspace are not being done in their own personal domain, it is impossible to say that myspace is a legitimate place to maintain your privacy. While there are several features on myspace that allow you to keep things personal, you can’t forget that you do not own the server in which this information is being stored on. While it shouldn’t be allowed for any organization to step in and retrieve this information without permission from the people who own it, it also cannot be forgotten that it can be retrieved with some sort of probable cause.\nIf you choose to keep this information private, lets say via a “private message” you obviously don’t want anybody but the recipiant to be able to view this information. I feel that this information should not be distributed anywhere unless the recipiant feels that it is a threat and they call someone else into it and has the information retrieved (with the approval of myspace). However, any public posts should be freegame for any kind of prosecution depending on the information put in it. Posting anything threatening in a public post would be like shouting “bomb” on an airplane.\nThere also has to be a place for schools to draw the line when it comes down to invasion of privacy as well. One big debate that has arisen has been that of facebook. While it is nice to know that schools can use facebook to ensure our security, they also have been known to use it to get kids in trouble for much more minor offenses (such as drinking on campus). I can’t officially say that they are not allowed to do this, since if someone does post a picture of themselves with a beer in their hand and they are under 21, it is illegal activity. However, if this information is attained without any kind of suspicion and it is being attained on facebook’s servers as opposed to their own, theyt should for the sake of human rights pass off this information as invalid. Then again, students have the option to keep their facebook profile private to only them and their friends.\nIt’s a difficult issue to deal with because while on one hand you have the governments protection off campus, on campus it is a whole different story. Loyola is a private institution, giving them many rights that the government does not have. When you attend this school you basically wave your constitutional rights at the door. I personally feel that this is wrong. However, the only way to be able to deal with this is to take some of the power away from private institutions and pass it back to the government so we will be able to maintain some of our rights guaranteed by the constitution. \n\n",
        "On the idea that there is gender discrimination, I believe that this idea of equallity will actually never be fully reached. I know that for most workers, the prefered idea of a boss is a male, thus there is always a glass ceiling affect that keeps women in the work force from getting ahead and being able to obtain jobs of high posistions. In a way, I can understand that most workers would prefer a male as the head of a company that has to deal with construction or IBM type corporations, because usually the idea is that if you are female and do hold such a high position in a company such as this, you are probably very pushy and possibly a bit “butchy”. This is the idea, mind you, not what is actually the case. However, it is also funny to think that if you are the head of a decorating company and you are a male then you must be gay. This again is the universal common thought, not what is actually the case. I just find it commical how some genders are expected to act if given certain responcibilites, when in fact they individuals and should not be stereotyped.\nAnother area that I find very interesting about gender discrimination is the idea that women think that just because they can bear children they should feel the need to voice out their oppinions on whether or not they can have abortions or not. If one thinks about it they claim that it is discrimination against them when they are told what they can and can not do with their bodies. THis is not the whole story though. Most people who argue against it are not argueing agians the women themselves, but against the idea that the women are in fact making a desision to kill someone. It actually goes back to the fact of some people believeing in from the moment of conception, there is a living person inside of the female, and thus they should not be th soul determiners of weather or not the baby gets to live or dye. The females who often argue on the idea of abortion ofthen do not think of it as killing anyone, so really this whole argument of gender discrimination is a front for what the true matter is.\nI do find it sad how now a days our society is getting to accept the idea that women can have children out of wedlock and still be ok on their own. While, I do respect women who are able to rais a child and hold down a job at the same time, i feel as if it is sad that the child only has one parent as a role model instead of two. I realize that there are many  valid reasons for not marying into a marraige, even if there is a child present, yet, if this is the case, why did they decide to have a child together? In my oppinion, it is best to wait until you know that you have found your right partner, and then have children, instead of out of wedlock.\nThere is another idea that men should be the soul providors for a family, yet as evident today, this is so often not the case anymore. More and more families are having both parents work. This is nice, because it shows that women can do things outside of the home other than just raise a family and take care of the house. I do find it sad, though, how sometimes, when the role is reversed…men stay at home and the women is the soul providor, that it is looked down upon. I do not feel as if this should be the case, yet it is just such the opposite of what everyone has grown up thinking that many people can not grasp this new concept. I hope that for the future this is one area that everyone can accept more in society.\nI guess when one really lookes at the idea of gender discrimination, it really often has to deal with other outside issues that influence the ideas on top of what “gender” issue is being talked about. So the whole idea really goes deeper then one thinks of pure cut and dry gender. \n\n",
        "I wanna start off by saying that I don’t care about gay people at all…in a good way.  I do not care what they do and I do not care if they get married.  I personally don’t agree with gay relationships, but if two men or two women want to get married my personal feelings have nothing to do with it.  Neither should the feelings of the conservations who find fault with them.  They argue that the sanctity of the church has been violated.  To this I say: if you don’t think the sanctity of your church has already been violated by hundreds of years of corrupt popes and priests, then you are a naive Christian.  So you don’t think gays should be allowed to marry but your priests touch little boys? Sweet.\nIn the discussion starter, morality of the family is mentioned,and while I certainly agree that family is important, this has nothing to do with gays being allowed to marry.  You can’t ban a certain type of relationship in the country because it doesnt promote good moral behavior.  There is nothing immoral, legally wise about same sex relationships.  Sure, you can find stuff in the Bible about why its bad, but the Bible holds no place in government.  Clearly one thing that is great about America, that most everyone will agree with on some level, is that our country was founded on the concept of freedom.  However, the conservatives (who seem to be the ones talking about freedom the most) have forgotten what it is.  So why are we denying homosexals the liberties enjoyed by the rest of us? Hell, even death row inmates are allowed to get married, and they’re about to die for severe crimes.  I guess thats just saying something about what freedom really is in this country.\nOne last point is that I dont agree with gay relationships.  I dont understand them and I dont like that they are doing something anatomically incorrect.  I feel they are misguided, that maybe if they gave the other sex a whirl they might just like it.  HOWEVER, I do not want to obstruct their liberties. Its not my place.  Hell, I think most conservatives are wrong, but I still think they should be allowed to vote.  I have several gay friends, one of which has been my good friend since almost I was born.  We’re still great friends and while it freaks me out that he likes to touch other dudes, I don’t have a problem with it.  He can keep doing what he does even though I think its wierd.  I mean, my roommate reads anime and I think thats weird and a waste of time, but that bitch can read anime all he wants, I dont give a care.  That’s whats great (or rather, what should be great) about this country. \n\n",
        "The question of the legalization of marijuana has been long debated, but there have been few conclusions as a result of all the controversy.  It is not clear that a majority of people feel one way or another about the issue, but that they remain split in their opinions.  This divide of opinions makes sense because there are very obvious good and bad consequences of the legalization of marijuana.  It is a matter of whether the good outweighs the bad that determines whether the drug should become legal.\nThere are undeniably some benefits to making marijuana legal, mostly because of the drug’s therapeutic properties and abilities as a medicinal treatment.  Most other arguments for the legalization of marijuana, however, do not point to the benefits of the drug, but rather the lack of harmfulness when compared to other substances.  This approach is a weak one, because it does not really make a case for marijuana as a useful drug, but merely states that it is not as bad as other drugs.  Such an argument of relativity says nothing about marijuana as a drug absolutely.  When considered in and of itself, it is clear that marijuana is a very harmful substance.  It can cause everything from changes in the sensory experience to a faster heartbeat, and can eventually lead to cancer.  Sure, other drugs might have more pronounced negative effects, but that does not make marijuana any less harmful.  The fact that marijuana is natural, for example, says nothing about its detrimental properties to one’s health.\nWith these considerations in mind, I think that marijuana should not be made legal, as it is clearly a harmful drug and its use can quickly get out of hand and lead to serious health problems.  In addition, marijuana is the gateway drug which can lead users to experiment with other much more detrimental drugs to which they can easily become addicted.  The United States would be doing no favor to its people by making such a harmful drug as marijuana more easily accessible, even if doing so would help to reduce the national debt. \n\n",
        "While it may be important to avoid trivialization of Church traditions by keeping them consistent, the advantages of their modification may be worth the risk.  As the world continues to change on a daily basis, the Catholic Church is getting left behind.  In general, people are not able to embrace traditions so ancient that the reasons for their existence are becoming obscured.  As was said, celibacy and a male priesthood are not vital to the message the Catholic Church means to portray.  If, after changing these traditions, a new wave of dedicated priests/priestesses emerges and a revitalization of faith occurs amongst Catholic followers, what harm is done?  If nothing is done, and the priesthood continues to decline at the rate it is going, no priests will be left to live by the traditions the Church has kept secure. \n\nUltimately, I leave these questions up to the Church.  Regardless of personal opinion, the Vatican, with its legions of dedicated theologians, holds the most comprehensive and in-depth knowledge and understanding of the Bible, our only connection to something that at least resembles God’s word.  While we can never, as mortals, perfectly interpret the word of God, the Vatican is certainly in the best position to take that role.  It is as if I attempted to argue with a botanist about whether a plant is poison ivy or not.  Who would you trust?  Obviously, some matters have more subjective content than others, but what viable solution can be presented that will decide on the “most Catholic” answer to these questions while maintaining the Church’s stability?  The Church is in a very difficult position.  Similarly to politicians, the Church has a world of people to please, people with infinitely different points of view.  Should the Church change its long established traditions to please a portion of its followers?  I don’t know, but I’m leaving it up to the Church itself to reach the answer.\n\n\u001a",
        "Pot…what’s the big deal??? I don’t see why people try to run others lives and how they want to treat their bodies…Personally, I believe that the legalization of pot should occur as a whole, and not only for medical purposes. There are, however, both positives and negatives to this drug which should be taken into consideration before its legalization.\nIf you look at the positives of the drug,  it obviously makes the person feel very relaxed- something most people in today’s society fail to do. Everyone is so uptight now a days, and I think that pot could somewhat help that problem. As said in other Blog entries, the revenue that would be taken into the United States would be incredible. We would surely take a huge chunk out of the black market, and we could even use that revenue or tax money (there would be a heavy “sin tax” placed on pot, because the government would not want people buying it too much- the reason porno, cigs and alcohol have “sin taxes” on them) in building useful things such as schools, homeless shelters, research facilities, etc. These research facilities could even be used to research certain things that are presently being “partially cured” by smoking the green leaf such as aids and/or glaucoma. I believe that pot will calm a person down, as opposed to alcohol. Have you ever heard of a rowdy stoner?? Well, the person may be in general, but while they are high they probably don’t get as violent as say a rowdy drunk.\nAs much as I do believe that the drug should be legalized, I also think that before it is, more information about the drug should be universally known. The country is doing a great job of showing Americans the risks of smoking cigs, and I think that doing the same for pot would be very beneficial. That being said, as soon as the drug is legalized, I have a feeling that kids will go on to the next “illegal hip drug.” If you don’t get what I said there, it’s in reference to pot being cool since it’s illegal…. I DO believe that pot is a gateway drug. Two of my friends, one of which is a close friend have, collectively mind you, tried cocaine, ecstasy, and sepia (even though it’s a legal hallucinogen used by smoking mainly). Many of the irresponsible people (such as these two) use pot as a gateway drug. What I mean by this is that it is used as one, but is not always a gateway drug for everyone- it depends on the person. To go along with what the others have said in reference to Europe, I can also see the percentage of pot smoking going down if it was legalized because it would simply not be as “hip.”\nHuman logic never ceases to amaze me…. \n\nI am pretty sure that I have heard that one of the main side effects of pot is future memory loss. Many teens do not care about this because it is a “minimal” side affect that will take place too far off into the future for them to realize how it will affect them. The youth of the U.S. is ignorant in this way- by not looking and/or caring about what could actually happen to them. This is their lives we’re talking about, so shouldn’t they consider the long term side effects? This is just another reason for the implementation of a certain age for being able to smoke.\nAnother Thing I think is interesting is how great (debatable) leaders such as Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have messed with drugs as youths. Isn’t this ironic how the leader of this entire country broke this law? Sure, “I didn’t inhale…” but hey, I “puffed” a cigar, but will still admit that I smoked it.  What is this country coming to when the leaders have gone against basically their country’s rules?\nHow strict is this country on smoking pot anyways? I have never smoked because I was afraid that it would somehow come back and bite me in the butt. After thinking about why I never smoked, I then look at people like Clinton and Bush to see where they have gone with their lives having done those things. It is true that the 60’s and 70’s were a “different time,” but you can’t always use that as an excuse. That’s more of a cheap way out in my opinion.\nWhat I’m trying to say here is that if our leaders have done it, then what’s wrong with it? I’m sure that if these two didn’t get into trouble with the law and/or media, then they would not care about these past actions. I think that people such as Clinton and Bush aren’t necessarily against things such as pot, but act as though they are to please the morals of this country imbedded over time. Sure, the ’60s and ’70s were different times, but present day is different than them and should be treated without considering those days. \n\nAnother thing to consider when talking about the legalization of marijuana is that it will provide the country with more jobs. I realize that there is a decent amount of unemployed peoples within the country, and even though it’s actually at a good level for our economy, I’m sure that many people would want a job. If marijuana was legalized, then factory and/or fields workers would be needed. If i’m not mistaken (which, i’m pretty sure I’m not) this extra work will help our economy by increasing its Gross Domestic Product. This is in the Macro economics sense, but I feel as though it does make a valid point. Even though the economy sometimes may not exactly need this extra help with GDP, I’m sure many families would appreciate the extra income hopefully being raked into the household. \n\n\u001a",
        "            I am firm believer that the United States should have never embarked on any type of military intervention in Iraq.  I have always looked at war as a last resort.  If a genocide needs to be stopped, or a dictator needs to have his hand taken away from the nuclear button, then in certain situations war is the only logical outcome.  That being said I agreed with our involvement in WWII and I would have been in agreement with any military assistance we could have provided during the Rwandan genocide that the Caucasian world never lost sleep over.  But Iraq, Iraq to me was a country ruled by an iron fist dictator that we installed when it was politically correct to do so in the early 1980’s.  Before we knew it our little Seddam had emerged from his puppet role as foe to the Ayatollah  Khomeini of Iran was now himself the most feared dictator in the Middle East.  Our foreign policy mistake almost thirty years ago has not lead to not one but now two wars in Iraq, and perhaps even worse our occupation can now be seen as holding up the infrastructure of a nation divided.\n            It is tough for me as an American voter with liberal political ideologies to not feel lied to by our government.  We have perpetuated the colonialist ways of nation building though big corporations. Dick Chaney’s own company Halliburton is rebuilding the rubble that used to be called Iraq, furthermore, pip lines through Afghanistan and other Middle Eastern countries are still flowing as planned.  To me Iraq was a smoke screen that ended up accidentally blinding the ones using it for cover.  There were no weapons of mass destruction only a brutal dictator that we as a country have shared intimate ties with for decades.  We should be out of Iraq as soon as possible.  The casualties, the expenses, and the Iraqi people, all need to be taken into account at this point.  Iraq is more dangerous today than it has ever been, and now our great nation may be directly responsible for that.      \n\n",
        "I’d like to know what the Europeans think.  It seems that there is a balance in each continent.  The discussion starter tells us that here in the United States, we don’t have a national ID system as they do in Europe.  But in the U.S. companies are allowed to gain access to any kind of personal information concerning employees that they can get their hands on, while in Europe such practices are much more strictly regulated.\n \n            I think that in the U.S., privacy rights are too often abused by the government, especially by such measures as the Patriot Act, passed and signed into law in October of 2001, which allowed government access to individual medical records, tax records, student records, etc., and expanded the ability of law enforcement to conduct secret searches.  That scares me. (I think Ben Franklin might be horrified too if he were still around)\n            To the best of my knowledge, when one applies for a job, he/she must inform the potential employer of any health problems that the applicant actually has – heart problems, some sort of disease, etc. – not what potentially could be wrong with him/her how every many years down the road.  I do not believe that employers or insurance companies should have access to individual genetic information.  There are certain genes that increase the likelihood of getting cancer and other diseases.  When health insurance agencies get a hold of tests that reveal such mutations, they turn down people who might never even get cancer.  But more importantly, if they turn down someone who does eventually get cancer, that poor individual will lack the health care coverage necessary to pay for exorbitant costs of treatment.  Knowing this, some people may decline to participate in genetic testing, and miss the opportunity to catch the disease before it even starts. \n\n",
        "Privacy?  In this day and age we don’t even know what the hell privacy is.  With communication the way it is we don’t know the meaning of the word.  People can steal your identity as easy as look at you.  If you have a computer you have the ability to get all of the information that exists on planet earth, and its not that hard to invade people’s privacy with it.\nWhen it comes to Id’s I doubt we’ll be able to get a better system then the one we have now.  ID’s can always be faked; no matter how “good” we think they are.  There is a whole franchise devoted to making fake ids.\nThen we have “medical confidentiality”.  Should anyone have the right to discuss your medical history? If we start letting out peoples medical secrets there will be chaos.  It’d be like putting people’s religion out for all to see.  That happened once.  Some Charlie Chaplin impersonator told a whole country that if they were a certain religion they had to wear a yellow star.\nWhat if we all had to wear labels with our history on them?  Where does it end?  Today it seems like there is no privacy to be had.  In a world where the government can decide to tap phones almost arbitrarily, where is it going to end?  Where does privacy start and safety begin?  I’m not sure anymore, it doesn’t make any more sense to me than it does to anyone else.  Seems to me we’re getting closer and closer to Orwell’s 1984 world.  Soon they’ll be able to charge us with “thought crime”, and monitor our every movement.  How soon will it be till we have screens in every room watching us, making sure we don’t break any rules?  How soon until every little thing we do is catalogued and watched? \n\n",
        "I think gender discrimination in the U.S. today is blown way out of proportion.  For the most part, employers today can’t afford to discriminate based on sex.  It is economically unwise.  For example, if an employer decides not to hire a woman with a skill set equal to or better than a man, a competitor can snatch her up.  The first employer loses out.  He/she is left with an inferior employee, while his/her competitor gets the better one.  Businesses today are only concerned with results.  There will always be bigots in this world who will discriminate, but that is just the nature of humanity.  U.S. society as a whole, however, does not discriminate based on gender.\nIt is up to the individual to make his or her place in the world.  There have been many instances in which a woman was not hired because the employer felt that she was not as qualified as someone else.  And if that someone else happens to be a man, it may seem like gender discrimination.  I feel like many cases of gender discrimination are just cases of coincidence.  There really is no way to prove that gender discrimination was the deciding factor if a woman isn’t hired.  Unless there is an undeniable trend, its hard to prove anything.\nI think the feminist movement had its place in the 1960’s when it was clear that women were not equal to men in society.  Today, however, women are equal to men.  If a woman wants to get an education and succeed, the only thing that can stop her is herself.  A good portion of the feminist movement today sees men as the enemy.  This is simply not the case.  Sure, there will always be those who discriminate against women.  There is no way to change some people.  Society (in the U.S. at least) is changed.  People are accepting of those who are different from them. \n\n",
        "Obviously this one of the biggest stories, if not the biggest story in the media today. Almost everyday we hear about new deaths in Iraq and we hear stories about how they are trying to set up a stable government. One question on most people’s minds is, “how much longer?” This “war on terror” is only generating more anti-American sentiments throughout the Middle East. “What have we solved?”\nIn my own opinion I feel that the war has gone on long enough. I did not agree with the original reasons for them to go into Iraq and I wholy resent the way that the war has gone. There were no weapons of mass destruction there. Wasn’t the original quarrel with Al Queda in Afghanistan? If anything, we only created more problems than we solved. While it is nice to have a terrible dictator out of power, there is still the fact that we have left their country in a chaotic state which I think very few would actually want to live in. Any thought that we could possibly set up a stable government with Iraq in this state is insane.\nThough I do feel that the war has gone on for too long, I do not think that we should pull out. We have caused a great deal of destruction and are obligated to fix what we’ve broken and get the people there back on their feet. Pulling out now would just send the two opposing sides (Suni and Shitte) into civil war. It could even turn out to be another Rwanda. In order to make any progress at all we first need to seek some sort of agreement between both the groups. Once we find that it will be much more plausable that we can set up a free government for the people there. However, when doing this we will also have to take into consideration the will of the people and the subjects that they are sensitive too (such as religion). \n\n",
        "The Catholic Church should certainly consider changing its ways.  I agree that the decision is completely up to the Catholic Church (the community) as to what changes should be made and when they should be made.  Times have changed and information has changed – people have progressed intellectually.  With this new information, it is up to the Church to decide what in their tradition is antiquated and what should stay tradition.\nAs with any organization, there is a certain element that should stay traditional.  Tradition is part of the identity and in the case of the Catholic Church, it encompasses their dogmas, doctrines, and any other central beliefs to the faith.  Some of their practices, however, reveal the antiquity with the organization.\nWhile I have no references, I have heard that the practice of not eating meat on Fridays during the Lenten season was derived from early Christian history fishing industry issues.  Certainly this issue and many others should be reconsidered in the contemporary Church so as not to push out potential members because of ridiculous, meaningless practices.\nThere are also issues such as gender discrimination amongst priests that needs to be revisited.  It seems very hard to believe that the God Christians speak of could make man and woman equal and yet not give her access to the clergy.  It seems to me that so much of the tradition has been passed along and given cultural and purely human interpretation:  it is said that the Holy Spirit has passed along the proper message to keep the faith alive in the Church, but I doubt that a lot of this inspiration did not come from purely human motivations.\nOne of the main problems with change in the Catholic Church, I think, is the lack of respect they would be given by many followers if any radical changes were made.  As with any organization founded on strong ideals and beliefs, if any of them are altered or appear to be altered then some of the followers may turn away.  Perhaps the Church believes that certain changes, whether significant to the faith or not, will appear just that way to many followers causing them to question their credibility.\n\n",
        "I believe that gay marraige is something that will probably be debated about for a while. Personally, I feel that if a couple of the same sex wishes to “get married” that is ok…except that it should not be called a marraige.  A marraige is between a man and a woman, but dont get me wrong here, I still think same sex couples should be able to be together. The reason why I think it should be called something different though, other than that a marraige is defined as a union between a man and a woman, is because I feel that if it were called the same, people of the church, and other religions (I do realize that we all mainly hear about just the christians, but believe me, there are tons of other religions out there just as opposed to it..we just dont hear about them b/c out president is christian)…would get offended and feel as if thier religion was getting mocked or stepped upon. Now i realize that this would not be the intent at all, but I am just saying how it would be viewed by the christinans and other religions, so that is why i am saying that I believe it is fine for there to be same sex couples unionized, but to come up with a different word (even different then union) to signify thier “marraige”.\nI would also like to say, that I agree that it is not right to make amendments about one’s sexual orientations in either direction. That is a personal choice. I would also like to say, that while i feel it is fine for same sex couples to get “married” for lack of a better word…I am not sure if i feel that they should really be raising children together. The reason for my thought is because children learn by example, so even if they were not gay themselves when born (which is a whole nother argument that i will not address right here) they will still see the behavior and perhaps get steered in that direction. Now I realize that the comment that I just made will get loud opposals, but I have to say, that I have TONS of freinds, and people that I look up to as roll modles, who are in fact gay,…some of these people having children. However, I have also noticed, that these children are all turning out to grow up and be gay themselves too..some of them being adopted, so I do not feel that it is stricktly biological. But again, I also see that they are provided with a very loving family…so I guess you could say that I am still on the fence with this issue.\nOver all, I feel as if same sex unions are ok, as long as they are not pushed so much into one’s face….you dont really see heterosexual couples pushing it into other people’s faces, so i feel as if both types of unions should be treated the same in this regard. \n\n",
        "Personally, I don’t believe this country should legalize marijuana because promoting a drug, and I feel that’s wrong and as a bio major it isn’t healthy. However, marijuana should be legalized for health purposes; if it will help prevent a disease or help someone cope with a disease they already have then I am not for seeing anyone go through unnecessary pain.  However, with many new phenomena there are both good sides and bad sides to the issue. On the negative side, I don’t believe the country should legalize and have it at local drug stores because of the potential risk of addiction and distribution it should be stored at hospitals or at places where an authoritative signature or later is needed in order to gain access to it.\nFrom what I’ve heard on commercials and from friends, those who are high on marijuana usually just waste their life because they smoke and sit in the same spot for hours. So it may affect someone for a few hours but they usually don’t move and even when they are driving they are moving really slow even though their hearts maybe doing something different. And according to the reading, it has the same long tern affects that a cigarette has, and that’s legal so then if in the long run they have the same affects why can’t it be legalized? I do agree with GOBIGDONNY in that our country is definitely not in a position to deal with the affects of legalizing marijuana. We have more problems such as gay marriage and the war in Iraq and the problems with the Catholic church to worry about legalization right now. And who knows this may just be a fad, in a couple years the hype of smuggling and selling marijuana may go down and we would have went through the trouble of legalizing it for no reason. \n\n",
        "            I am a member of the facebook.com.  For me it has been an open forum for meeting friends at my school, getting in touch with old high school friends, and of course maybe grabbing a screen name or a phone number of the cute girl that sits next to me in class.  However, last year one of my friends was suspended for one game of his lacrosse season because in one of his facebook pictures he was holding a beer and he is not of the age.  How did he get in trouble?  Our athletic director has a facebook account under some fake name and decided to check my friend’s pictures.  This is an invasion of privacy on multiple levels.  First of all he is using a false identity to look at pictures of college students he knows performing illegal deeds after the fact.  The police couldn’t even have arrested my friend for drinking but our AD can suspend him.  Moreover, where is the line to be drawn?  Our lives are already monitored to a heartbeat here at Loyola, we are given luxurious apartments along with freedom from our parents for the first time in our lives, and then immediately reprimanded by RA’s and prick resident directors for entertaining the idea of beer before we are 21. \n            That all being said I am in favor of finding out about a bomb threat through myspace.com.  As far as I am concerned if it saves lives it is alright by me.  That doesn’t mean I want my house to be wire tapped.  But if I had written on my front lawn that I am going to bomb a building than it would be ok to do some fly by surveillance.  Our government’s role is to protect and to serve its citizens, not to be overbearing and intrusive.  It is my belief that our president should have been impeached for his role in the wire tapping of certain American citizens following the terror attacks on 9/11.  It is just sad that our privacy had to be impinged upon as retaliation for our government not being informed enough about the acts that lead up to 9/11. \n            In our schools, privacy should be permitted to a certain degree where a principals or a deans discretion being used to make final decisions.  Lockers and emails should be accessible for investigation if need be, but under no circumstances should our phone conversations be recorded.  Myspace and facebook transcend both phone and email conversations.  They are open forums for freedom of speech for my generation.\n",
        "According to the discussion starter, it sounds reasonable that marriage between a man and a woman be for procreation purposes. I have been taught that men and women are meant to marry under a religious ceremony and procreate. To me, marriage has always been the cover for having kids. When I imagine myself in twenty years, I envision myself as the mother of five kids. I can’t imagine being married or what my spouse will look like. In today’s age, people usually marry because they are in love or strongly attracted to another person. Sometimes the idea of a family does not even cross the couples mind when they are married- the family becomes just the two of them.\n            With this change in people’s desires for a family, there has also been a change in the validity of the definition of marriage. Marriage is no longer a way to procreate, but a way to express commitment to the one person you (hopefully) truly love. For this reason, I believe that same sex marriages should be allowed. If a man and woman can be married for reasons other then procreation, then a woman and woman and man and man should have equal rights. Same sex partners can procreate through artificial insemination or even adopt together. I believe we should give all people a chance to form a family.\n            I want same sex marriage to be legalized, but at the same time do not agree with the last paragraph in the discussion starter. I do not think that the legalization of same sex marriage will encourage same sex partners to settle down with one partner and form a family. I believe that these are peoples own choices and this new option will not change them. If partners want to settle down and have children, then they will, with or without the legalization of marriage. Marriage is just a title. \n\n",
        "            The Iraq “war”.  It’s a touchy subject for most people, especially kids our age.  Most of the soldiers in Iraq are not much older than us, but hey, they’re fighting for what they believe in, there hasn’t been a draft. We went in for the wrong reasons, yeah, we should have just gone in saying we were going after Sadaam, hell, we’ve had the ability and the permission to do that for years. What I don’t get is people saying we should just pull all of our soldiers out of Iraq.  Drives me crazy.  There’s a reason that we went there, and we need to help the people there, there’s no one else to help.  This isn’t some political ploy to keep Bush in office or to make him look better.  Honestly, when people say stuff like that it scares me.  First of all, no one would use others lives just to get themselves ahead, it’s a ridiculous notion.  Secondly, how in the HELL would this help?\n            Yeah, sure, after 9/11 people were screaming for us to go to war.  So we went.  Those same people are screaming for us to pull out and leave these people defenseless and without a government. This isn’t the war on terror anymore; we’re aiming to help people.  We’ve gotten rid of the terror.  Then people say, “Oh at least under Sadaam there was order”.  Yeah, an order maintained by murder, how is that good in any way shape or form?  Contrary to the belief being spewed from our media these days, we aren’t trying to make a “little America”, we’re trying to make a better place for everyone to live.

        "Legalizing marijuana? Why not? There are no known hazards to your health. Cigarettes, from what I know, pose more danger to people in society then marijuana will ever pose. I have many friends that smoke marijuana and it has not effected their academic performance, social life, or home life. the only thing it has effected greatly is their financial status! Most of them say that they can stop anytime, they do not feel that marijuana is addictive. They also find it to be relaxing. They like to unwind after a hard day at school, or just to casually smoke with friends ( like you would casually have a beer after a hard day). Some even find that smoking marijuana now and then enhances their academic performance. Because marijuana relaxes them, they find that they are able to rid themselves of anxiety over stressful situations and tests and are able to recall facts easier. From what I have heard, marijuana seems less harmful then alcohol and cigarettes. However, too much of anything is not good, and there is no way that the government could possibly keep track of how much marijuana each person has at one time, just like alcohol and cigarettes, it is a matter of personal preference and choice. Because marijuana smoke can be very disgusting to some just like cigarette smoke, I do not think it should be legal for people to be able to smoke in public. Personally, I do not enjoy marijuana smoke and I have never tried it and never will. I have always been against any kind of smoking. However, from what I here, it does not seem to be as harmful as some people make it out to be. I think by legalizing it, the government will have less problems. Kids will not have to go to dangerous dealers or dangerous places to get marijuana, they will be able to go to a safe store. The government has to weight the pros and cons of this decision very wisely. \n\n",
        "The war in Iraq has become one of the most talked about issues in our world today. The “war on terror” has been criticized as having gone on too long. Many Americans think that we have lost our focus overseas and could be focusing on conflicts that are more of a threat to our safety.\nWe have been over in Iraq for over four years now. I don’t believe that it would be beneficial to the United States to completely remove ourselves at this point in time. We are staying in Iraq to help them establish a democracy, but is democracy a far-fetched goal? We have eliminated Saddam Hussein’s power over the Iraqi people, but how do we know when we have helped enough?\nWith a change of President in our immediate future any drastic movement in Iraq would not be smart. Furthermore, it is easier for us to make judgments because we do not know all of the information about what is going on in Iraq. There are large numbers of American troops currently in Iraq and I think that it is time for them to start to come home. I believe that Iraq still needs governmental guidance, but maybe we could do so without keeping all of our troops there. Every day there are innocent people dying, but do these soldiers even know exactly what they are fighting for?\nLeaving now would leave the people with no hope. We will have successfully freed them from their oppressor, but we have not established a strong government to take control. Although we have done much in ways to help their freedom, there is still much more that can be done. Its just a matter of how much longer this will go on, and how many more lives will “need” to be taken.\n\n",
        "The stigma attached to marijuana is unwarranted and has been around for far too long (Just for the record, “Reefer Madness” is hysterical, though). The government already condones alcohol and tobacco, and while some studies have shown that marijuana contains more carcinogens then tobacco, it’s used much less frequently. Casual marijuana smokers tend to use it two or three times a week, whereas tobacco smokers usually smoke three or four times a day.\nI think that one of the primary reasons the government isn’t willing to legalize it is because they believe it would be hard to tax and track marijuana sales. The underground market for it is already well-entrenched, and most people who already grow, sell, and buy it this way probably aren’t going to suddenly want to switch to a system in which they can by it legally for more expensive prices (since it would be taxed. The price depends upon the old law of supply and demand, though, of course). This isn’t an example of the government weighing things according to what benefits the people, but rather it’s them worrying about how they’re going to make money off the deal.\nThe strain current marijuana laws put on our judicial systems and prisons can’t be overestimated, either. So much time and money is wasted busting people for relatively minor infractions that laws that are more lenient would benefit the country in general.\nA couple people seem concerned about the possibility of higher incidences of DUIs with the legalization of pot. I don’t think the number of incidences would be any higher than those of drunk driving, though, and would probably be lower.\nI also haven’t met anyone who smokes pot purely for the “thrill” of doing something illegal. Most people I’ve met who smoke seem to do it because they enjoy its (usually) mellowing effects and the way it temporarily enhances (or obscures) their normal perceptions of the world.

        "hoopdreams, your blog entry baffles me. although you do make some amazingly intellectual statements (such as pointing out that World War II was justified) and a nice history lesson about the real truth of how saddam hussien came to power (or, as you quipped, “our little Seddam”. like, LoL!!1!!), there is a blanket statement that just doesn’t coincide with the rest of your entry.  Now, its easy to see you’re taking every precaution to let the interweb know you are an smart, educated person with “liberal political ideologies” that is good at writing hip blog entries, but you let your guard down when you posted this:\n“…I would have been in agreement with any military assistance we could have provided during the Rwandan genocide that the Caucasian world never lost sleep over.”\nnow, i understand that sometimes these blog entries get a little tedious, and everyone is tempted to (if they don’t already) just type down the first 300 words that they can think of on the given topic.  but thinking that every single white person didn’t care about something as horrific as the Rwandan genocide? thats using the same logic that people do when they say all black people are good at basketball. its not the meaning of what you wrote that annoyed/offended me - i’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you meant something else - but how unintelligent of a statement it is in a blog entry full of intellectual quips. i would continue , but im not trying to sound intelligent, just prove a simple point. plus, arguing online is best summed up by this: http://cache.bordom.net/images/ba1c8cf1553955352def95c659544c9d.png\noh, and just for the record, the iraq war sucks - but everybody knows that.  even the people without “liberal political ideologies” who want to stay believe that its being run poorly right now. \n\n",
        "I do not agree with Bush’s continuation of the war in Iraq because it is not accomplishing anything. There have been very few victories on our side for the amount we have had to pay in actual dollars and human lives. I think it is impossible to call the war in Iraq a war on terrorism when terrorism is so prevalent in around the world; Iraq is just one of many and even if by some miracle America won the war in Iraq, it would only be a very small victory against terrorism. I am not against the fight against terrorism, especially since it threatens not only the American way of life, but western society as a whole, but I am against the way Bush has gone about it. I think that it is impossible to be successful in this endeavor if he does not have the support of not only this nation, but others. It is impossible to fight this fight all on your own. I recently saw a documentary called Obsession (I highly recommend it), which was about the effects of radical Islam. There is an enormous Muslim population in the world, and the majority of them are not at all violent or in agreement with jihad, however the number of Muslims that are is more than the population of the U.S. Because of this, it is impossible for the U.S. to go about this alone. Some of the most alarming parts of this documentary was the genuine hatred that those who are advocates for jihad have for the west. This hatred is ingrained in them beginning in childhood and the amount of passion they have for their cause is more than I’ve ever seen for anything else. The most disturbing part of the documentary was the parallels they presented between the jihad and the Nazis. I think that the world is underestimating what the advocates of jihad are capable of, kind of like they did with the Nazis. I think that Bush is right to want to battle terrorism and put an end to it, but his methods thus far have been very ineffective. The Iraqi war at this point is a lost cause at my opinion and in order for anything to truly be accomplished on any level, more countries need to be willing to contribute. \n\n",
        "I believe that gay marriage should be every bit as legal as straight marriage.  People who argue against gay marriage will say that it will destroy the family unit as we know it.  But what do they mean by “family unit”?  To me, it means a family in which the family members love each other.  I do not think it is centered on the ability of a couple to reproduce.  The idea that marriage exists solely for the purpose of procreation is antiquated.  Several hundred years ago, it was important for a couple to have as many children as possible because they would be able to work on the farms or around the house.  This idea still persists in the minds of those who oppose gay marriage.  Is it not acceptable for a straight couple to choose to not have children?  Of course it is.  Marriage is based on a loving relationship between two adults.\nThe fact of the matter is that homosexuals do exist and will continue to exist for as long as the human race exists.  Why should they be deprived of the right to marry the person they love?  People will claim that homosexuality is a choice that the homosexual person makes.  The Catholic Church even goes so far as to call it a sin.  To this I ask, why would a person choose to be homosexual and put up with all the hardships they have to face every day that straight people simply do not?  Not many, I would think.  And yet there are millions of gay people world-wide.  It almost seems certain that homosexuality is genetic.  It’s just like having red hair or being left handed.  Viewed in this context, it seems barbaric and uncivilized that homosexuals do not have the same rights as heterosexuals.\nI think a homosexual couple is perfectly capable of raising a child in a loving environment.  And if being gay is genetic, people won’t have to worry about a child’s gay parents brainwashing him/her to be gay also.  One hundred years from now, I think we’ll look back and wonder how we could be so foolish and close-minded as to deprive two loving individuals the right to marry. \n\n",
        "            First of all, there are a number of reasons that may have motivated the United States Government to proceed with Operation Iraqi Freedom.  One of the biggest reasons that Bush often talked about was Saddam Hussein’s possession of weapons of mass destruction.  Of course, no such weapons were ever found.  And at that time other countries like North Korea openly admitting possessing and developing such nuclear weapons.  Was the U.S. government blinded by the oil in Iraq perhaps?  Some critics say that Bush had some sort of personal agenda in trying to do what his father did not, that is, remove Saddam from power when he had the chance at the end of the 1st Gulf War.  And of course, as the discussion starter explains, many government officials and American citizens believed in 2003 that the invasion of Iraq was part of the War on Terrorism.\n            It seems to appear that Operation Iraqi Freedom has created more terrorists.  By removing the Iraqi government, the U.S. created a power vacuum from which chaos ensued.  Without a feasible plan to combat such conditions, the country, 4 years later, is still plagued by rival religious and cultural factions and Iraqi citizens and U.S. soldiers alike live in terror.  If nothing else, this war has incited more animosity against the U.S., among more then those directly affected in Iraq.  By invading Iraq, the U.S. ignored the decision of the United Nations, an international peace-keeping body whose success relies upon the cooperation of its members.  Such an action seems to contradict the image that the United States makes for itself, that of leader of the free world and great example for other nations, and it has also alienated several former allies.\n            I don’t believe that the United States government had a legitimate reason to invade Iraq.  However, now that we have spent 4 years disrupting their country and turning it upside down, I do not think that it would be fair to the Iraq people if we leave them in a state of chaos and warfare.  It will take a long time to repair the state of Iraq, much longer than most people realized when they supported the war in 2003.  Democracies are not built overnight, and it takes even longer for them learn how to function adequately.  If we look at our own country’s history, almost 100 years after the writing of the Constitution, the United States was still divided with Americans fighting fellow Americans.  How could we possibly have expected it to be any easier in Iraq? \n\n",
        "My home town is made up of working women and stay at home moms. My mother is a part time worker and full time mother. I do not feel the people around me have experienced gender discrimination but choose their occupations. Some families are not lucky enough to be able to survive on one income, some can, and others choose to have multiple incomes. I think it is great that women have progressed and are able to have an equal chance in the work world. At the same time, I feel that some women feminists condemn those that CHOOSE to stay at home. In my opinion staying at home is an equally respectable job that requires hard work and talent.\nMy aunt was a special education teacher until she became a full time mother with three kids. Her eldest has graduated college, her middle is a freshman in college, and her youngest is thirteen. She has decided to go back to teach as a substitute for elementary school children. In my opinion, my cousin’s have become decent members of society. As I mentioned before, my mother worked part- time and was a full time mother. She continues to work in order to pay for our education. I feel that my brothers and I have turned out as responsible and respectable individuals. I believe a woman’s choice is very important. The fact that my mother and aunt were able to choose what they wanted to do is a luxury many women may not have.\nI feel that a woman’s role can be somewhat underestimated and looked down upon by females in the working field. One can not know what something is like until they experience it. Working women should not criticize stay at home moms. Stay at home moms should not criticize working women. Each person satisfies their special needs by spending their time differently. I applaud women feminists for their hard work in battling oppression against our gender. Luckily I have not experienced gender discrimination, but do understand that it exists. \n\n",
        "The institution of marriage is terribly broken, as can be seen by the fact that we have a 42%+ divorce rate, and eradicating gay marriage is NOT going to fix it. The “religious right” and the “liberal left” have to stop defining them along arbitrary single-issue lines like this one, because they are going nowhere. Besides, the majority of gay people who want marriage feel so because they want the LEGAL benefits (hospital visits, tax advantages of marriage, co-sign their mortgage, etc). They do not just want to marry for petty security, like so many straight couples who end up divorced. What we need to do is find a COMPROMISE, one that allows gay couples who love each other to enjoy the legal benefits of a married status WITHOUT offending the fundamentalist christians who poop themselves at the mention of “same sex marriage”. We can call it “gayrriage” or “civil union” or something, I honestly dont care what the name is, but it should allow the financial, legal, tax, and other priveleges of marriage to gay couples without being named “marriage” in a religiously offensive way. No offense to those who are devoutly religious, as faith is an extremely respectable thing. However, it is innapropriate to hijack the legal system to serve the “moral ends” of one particular religion. It is also unfair to disallow the aforementioned benefits (which are of a legal nature) to gay couples on religious grounds (which are not of a legal nature). Anyone catch my drift? Gay marriage won’t end the world or corrupt our society, and it doesn’t even have to be called gay marriage…. I don’t care if it’s called a “happy pony land ceremony” instead of a “wedding”, as long as the gay couple is allowed to legally act with the unity provided to married couples, our society will be treating its gay citizens more fairly. \n\n",
        "            Gender discrimination is very common in many places, including the United States.  The problems that we see as Americans in our own society are probably doubled or tripled in other countries where tradition has higher value, and gender roles are firmly rooted in the past.  Nonetheless, the issue of unevenness between males and females is a serious issue that should be addressed as quickly as possible.\n            Feminism is a very popular belief that men and women should be treated as equals.  That is, there should be no preconceived prejudices about one sex or the other.  I think that most people would believe in the feminist cause, though few would be willing to admit it because of the connotation associated with feminism.  People associate feminists with being fiery zealots, and the word feminism recalls images of suffragists and public displays.  Women’s suffrage was but a milestone along the path of feminism, but it was one that has made an impression on people because of its significance and the way in which it was achieved.  Women’s suffrage was actually achieved in England during a period of war before it was achieved in the United States.  Perhaps the reason we today associate the suffrage movement with zealousness is that in order to make their cause heard in a time of war, women’s suffragists had to be loud and adamant about their cause.\n            Though women’s suffrage was a very public and passionate movement, it is also possible to achieve steps towards the elimination of gender discrimination in more subtle ways.  Laws such as the Equal Pay Act and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act help make the public more conscious of the areas in which gender discrimination permeates to today.  The most obvious manifestation of this discrimination is in the workplace, which these acts target. With attention focused on this inequality, perhaps equality between men and women in the workplace can someday be achieved.  While the workplace is the most common and notable venue for gender discrimination, there are many other scenarios in which men and women can be treated unfairly.  Not all of these can be helped by laws, but they can all be helped by a better understanding of the problem of gender discrimination, its causes, and its consequences. \n\n",
        "When the Iraq War first began, I supported our stance in the conflict and truly believed that we had just cause to take action.  Saddam Hussein was a known evil dictator who used violence to cause fear and hold control over an entire people.  There was also the chance that Hussein was concealing weapons of mass destruction somewhere in the country.  What chance that was, we will never know.  And that is the question that matters, only because we did not find any WMDs.  The media has criticized the President for this decision after no WMDs, but I think the criticism is unfounded for several reasons. First, no one knows what intelligence the President had regarding WMDs in Iraq.  Perhaps he had gotten a strong piece of intel from a very trustworthy source that happened to be proven untrue.  Until we know what information he accessed to make his decision, we can not criticize.  Second, Hussein, with his fearsome army that still fights us toe to toe each day, must have owned thousands of different weapons depots located throughout Iraq.  If there was WMDs in Iraq before the war, Hussein could have easily given the order to have them moved out of the country or disassembled a second after being notified of our imminent invasion on CNN.  Even after we first invaded, there was not nearly enough man power to search each and every depot in Iraq.  Even now, they may not have searched every one.  And all this time, a WMD could have been snuck out while the war went on.  Third, Saddam Hussein is evil!  His removal from power is a great gift bestowed upon the world by the United States.  To make a stretch of a comparison, Iraq is not unlike Somalia!  In both cases, an evil force bent on greed was committing the crime of genecide and would have continued if no one stepped in. \n\n",
        "Let’s clarify something, first off. “Feminism” as a theoretical designation and a movement, is a very vague term that encompasses a diverse range of beliefs and ideas. When I simply say “feminist,” I could just as easily be talking about the aesthetics of Heidi Gottner-Abendroth as the renegade social commentary of Camille Paglia, which are very, very different things. Many types of feminist theory are still prominent in academic circles, however, and have a significant role to play (Elaine Showalter’s art historical work is a good example). My point in all of this is that we have to be careful how we bandy that term about; to reduce “feminism” to a Rosy the Riveter “We can do it!” mentality that a bunch of women had in the 60s is a vast oversimplification.\nAnyway, I don’t think that gender-based discrimination is still a huge problem in the United States. I think that there are still some areas of life where it remains a significant obstacle, however, and those aren’t necessarily all directly related to the workplace. The prompt describes the way in which many women feel compelled to leave home for the work place, or feel compelled to stay home to raise children. This is an internal conflict many (or even most) women still experience, and is the result of millennia of social attitudes that advocate that they should have a particular role to play. Whether or not these attitudes were unfair, considering their context, is one thing; the fact that they persist is unfair, however. How many women do you think are made to feel like bad mothers for leaving their children at daycare? By comparison, how many fathers do you think are made to feel like bad parents for doing the same? (Answer: many, and probably not many). This is the result of age-old ideas about gender roles we still maintain. Feminism wasn’t just concerned with changing the role of women in society; it was concerned with changing attitudes like these, which is why it persists and is still pertinent.\n\n",
        "as a roman catholic, the updating of the catholic church is an issue that hits close to home.  while i don’t plan on becoming a priest, it is obvious that the matters mentioned concerning the eligibility and conditions of the priesthood have consequences to any Catholic, as Boston unfortunately found out in the awful way it did.\nfirst off, i don’t see anything wrong with letting priests marry or allowing women to become priests.  the reasons given below my post are at least on the right track; if not i agree with them completely.  the idea of the priest being “married to church” and therefore not allowed to have a wife has become viewed as antiquated and (despite many centuries of priests being able to conduct their duties fine celibate) the more i truly think about the argument, the more i agree with the reformers. allowing women to become priests just makes sense: the gender issue is definately outdated and in the (relatively) equal society between men and women we live in today there is no legitimate reason to keep a woman from joining the priesthood.\nassuming that the church eventually does update itself on these two matters, it would be interesting to speculate what order it does update.  based on my understanding, i would assume woman priests would be admitted before any priest was allowed to marry: even a celibate woman priest would still be “married to the church”.\nfinally, i think that the ending points of the starter post are very relevent and well put.  any time an influential institution that people base their beliefs off like the Church changes its doctrines, the change needs to be well thought out.  the institution does not even need to be religious; we can see similar parrellels with the controversy of president bush attempting to amend the constitution on the issue of gay marriage. \n\n",
        "In the recent weeks of talking about such subjects such as legalizing Marijuana, I have to say that as of right now I am very much on the fence with this one. I agree that in compairison to alcohol it does not seem as harsh in that your liver does not dye and while your judgments are impaired, most people I have talked to say that it is a different type of impairment in compairison to alcohol. I myself can make no such claim having never smoked it.\nIt is also proven, like the discussion starter has stated, that it helps to aliviat the pain in cancer and glaucoma patines, and also helps to increase appitie in those that seem to loose it, such as sufferers of AIDS and other sicknesses.\nHowever, it also seems to have many side affects. I can personally say that I have noticed changes in some of my fellow classmates when they start to smoke marijuana. Many of them are not as sharp as they used to be, or as quick on thier feet to answer questions. I also know that the fact that you are smoking it results in the same fassion as a cigarett. You can get cancer in the lungs, throat, and have your teeth turn yellow. One’s eyes aslo become very bloodshot looking after smoking, and it is known to leave some people with visions or hallusinations. It dose affect ones’ judgments, and reation speeds, and would only lead to more car crashes on the road because now one has to worry about drunk and high drivers.  All of these facts lead to the very negative side of the drug.\nOn the other hand, many people already smoke the drug and probably already drive high. The drug being illegal only makes for a profit on the black market and the underground, and in reality it would help the country financially. If Marijana was made leagal, then the country could put taxes on it, just like cigaretts, and they could export it to other countries and gain a huge proffit off of it. It could probably help get our country out of debt actually, it being the “tobacco plant” of the 21st century.\nIt would cut down on mob wars, because it would be legal, and it would also stop some of the drug trafficing from mexico to the USA. Poor farmers would also probably benifit from it exceedinly well.\nFor all of these reason, I am on the fence. On the one hand it seems as if there are many many positive aspects, and on the other hand, I have been taught that it is just wrong to do or take for one’s body. I almost feel as if it should be legalized, just so that it can be regulated better, and create a proffit for the United States. Also, it could be extreemly well publicized that it is not so good for one’s body just like the warning on cigarett packages. Either way to look at the issuse of legalizing it or not becomes very tricky. \n\n",
        "Homosexuality is a lifestyle that is up and coming in our society today. People, especially in areas such as New York City, are used to seeing same sex couples walking around, kissing, holding hands, and hugging. For some, these kinds of acts are viewed as unholy, not right, weird, gross, and just not the norm. Others, however, see no problem with how homosexuals act in public, they believe that it is their choice, their life. For me, I am in the middle on this issue. I do believe that it is their choice and their life to do what they want, however, I am not keen on even having heterosexual couples displaying their affection for each other in public. I just think it makes everyone else around them uncomfortable. I think this issue of same sex couples is one that is like gender issues, as time passes, it will become more normal and more accepted. We cannot expect our society that has been viewing heterosexual couples as the norm for thousands of years to just change. Because I went to Catholic school for most of my life, I have seen many people disapprove of this behavior. I know that this is the church’s view on the issue of homosexuality, however, the church does not have the last word in every issue. It does not always have to make the final judgment on what is right and what is wrong. However, when speaking about gay marriage, I believe that the church’s opinion does matter. Marriage is a sacred sacrament that has been in the Catholic religion since the beginning. If gay couples want to be recognized as a couple by the state, that is fine. However, they have to realize that they will never be recognized by the church as a couple because homosexuality is against Catholic beliefs. They cannot expect the church to change it’s views on this issue so drastically. Over time, I think, the Church might warm up to the idea because it will become such a norm ion society, but that will not be for a long while. \n\n",
        "As a member of the Roman Catholic Church, there are certain traditions that I believe should be changed, those that perpetuate inequality and gender discrimination, as well as those that were formed for reasons that no longer matter in our present society.  I am talking about the exclusion of women from the priesthood, and the rules that do not allow priests to get married and have families once they have become priests (because there are cases in which a married man, usually a minister in a different Christian Church, is allowed to convert to Catholicism and become a priest).  There are many good reasons to allow women into the priesthood besides the simple fact that the way it is now the Church condones inequality.  Like the discussion starter mentions, there is severe dearth of priests in the Catholic Church.  I’m sure there are a number of women who gladly fill those open positions if given the chance.  Isn’t denying them the chance just hurting the congregations?  I also think that it would have been much more difficult for the priest sex scandals to remain a secret as long as they did if women had been members of the clergy.\n \nWith regard to marriage, it was only in the 11th century that the Church decided that priests could no longer get married.  At that time, the Church was the most powerful institution in Europe, and its officials, including priests, owned a lot of land.  The Church didn’t want to lose this land to the families of the priests, and so they forbad priests to get married.  Yes, there were spiritual arguments offered for the change in tradition, but the main motives behind the decision were power and greed.\nHaving said all that, I believe that the tenets of the Catholic faith are very important in today’s society.  Considering the fast-pace changes that occur in all areas of our lives, technology, science, entertainment, etc., I think that it’s essential to have at least one stable, steadfast presence in our lives. \n\n",
        "The issue of privacy, as was shown by the discussion starter, bridges several realms of life:  including everything from the medical field to everyday conversations.  To make any sort of laws or protective sanctions for privacy rights is extremely difficult because the issue touches on so many different topics with different ramifications when misused in each.  There are, however, some generalizations that could or should be made in the realm of privacy.\nThe first thing to consider when speaking of privacy is the medium of communication.  The medium of communication is the means by which the message is sent.  Some examples might include phone, e-mail, or a website.  If the medium by which the information travels is an open one (meaning it is accessible to the general public) than the information can not be considered private.  If the message travels via a knowingly private means, such as telephone or e-mail, then the question of privacy becomes more complicated.  One must consider the means of communication when sending a message because it will dictate the actual privacy.  An example would be MySpace:  if a person were to post a message in their MySpace profile or to somebody else’s, that would be considered public.  The reason this is a public means of communication is that it is easily accessible to the general public without any special restrictions or security protecting the message.\nAnother factor to consider with the issue of privacy rights is the content.  For instance, if the content trying to be acquired was some social secret amongst friend, privacy will almost always win out.  In that case the information was not critical and did not necessarily harm anybody.  If, however, the information dealt with the live of another individual the content is much more pertinent.  When human safety is brought into the content and is being sought after, perhaps there is not such a right to privacy.  The greater right that could be destroyed in lieu of the right to privacy would be the right to life of the individual in the message.\n\n",
        "I’m definitely with Mtnbike9 on this one. I’ve never heard anyone make a reasonable, articulate argument for why gay marriage should be banned. Most arguments against it I’ve heard refer to marriage as a “sacred institution.” Well, if you go to a church and get married, then it’s certainly a sacred institution for you. But the fact of the matter is that sacraments are not a concern of the federal or the state governments. When a state issues a marriage license, it’s called a license for a reason. It’s a document with legal ramifications recognizing a special relationship between the two individuals involved. Denying gays marriage licenses is silly; it would be like refusing to grant forklift operator licenses to left-handed people.\nChurches are free to make whatever rules they want about who can get married in their churches. That’s their right. Their decisions and beliefs have no proper bearing on the law, though. Like it or not, we don’t live in a theocracy, and ideas about holy writ don’t hold up in court as rationalizations for stupid laws (or attempted constitutional amendments).\nThe fact that portions of the Republican Party (coughBushcough) would waste time clamoring for a ban on gay marriage demonstrates a gross misplacement of values. It looks like they’ve tabled that idea for the time being, and I’m glad (there happens to be an important geographic region of the Middle East that’s badly in need of a plan for stabilizing it. Somehow, this strikes me as being more important than stopping the government from issuing legalistic little pieces of paper to specific couples).\nAlso, the argument that heterosexual procreation provides the building blocks of civilization is not only dated, but unwieldy in a world that’s quickly becoming overpopulated. The government has absolutely no control of who has sex with whomever else, and any argument based on the idea that marriage licenses are somehow dispensed as have-legit-sex cards is laughable. \n\n",
        "Different CULTURES gradually define which attitudes they will or won’t accept. Things like sex, gender roles, education, work ethic, marriage, etc. are esteemed differently in different societies. Such attitudes are subject to change, however, especially when empowered groups of citizens put forth an effort to change them.\nDuring World War II (and into the cold war), the prevailing American family image was that of the “nuclear family”. Society more or less MANDATED (at least for suburbanized white people) that fathers be breadwinners, mothers stay at home and bear 2.4 children, and people marry early for security (from those damn reds). Anyone who strayed (by not marrying, divorcing, etc) was estranged and labeled “outsider”. These “American” values were reinforced by mass media (i.e. popular mechanics vs. redbook), and most people attempted to pass them on to their children. In short, these people endorsed and strengthened the imposition of traditional gender roles. Women gradually grew dissatisfied with this setup, however, as their true potential was often underutilized in the housewife role.\nBetty Friedan’s book “The Feminist Mystique” pretty much spells it all out. Friedan, in an admirably brave fit of non-conformism, provided hundreds of airtight arguments AGAINST the prevailing gender roles which American society imposed. Her “activism” mirrored other “activism” which was simultaneously going on, against Viet Nam, against drug laws, against parents, and pretty much against everything “societal” (i.e. hippies). This is an example of the “empowered citizens” I was talking about before.\nI think it was only a matter of time before women broke out of arbitrary gender inequities. Unfortunately, like racism, gender inequity hasn’t fully been purged from our society, despite the efforts of many. However, the wage gap is closing, and women are breaking out of the house to work in droves.\nWhat does trouble me is that a culture of “having kids early” exists disproportionately more in impoverished areas, putting stress on already broken public institutions (public schools, etc), and already depressed financial situations. Thats pretty bad. I think I hit 300 words now so I’m gonna end this here and go get my money. \n\n",
        "The church is an interesting topic for me to discuss.  I was raised both catholic and protestant and now I’m leaning heavily towards neither.  But I have to be honest, before I say anything about the issues in and surrounding the Catholic Church there’s something else I need to say.  There is a problem with any organized religion on the planet because, lets face it, no one is going to agree on every little point.  It’s just not going to happen.  But the Catholic Church has its own problems.  In regards to some things it seems like the Church is still stuck in the Dark Ages.  Women can’t be part of the clergy, well why the hell not?  Women can do anything men can do, and some things that they can’t.  It’s ridiculous to not give them the option to pledge their lives to the clergy, and not just as a nun.  I don’t care that the church is supposed to be infallible; it’s a chauvinistic tradition.  This isn’t even a rule set down by the bible; it’s a tradition that was made by the church in a time where women couldn’t own property.  It really makes no sense for this “rule” to be in place.\nAnother “rule” that has no place in our society today is the rule that priests can’t marry.  This is another one that has no actual religious backdrop.  Priests originally were allowed to have families and marry, however the Church realized that if priests had sons, their land and money went to their sons rather than the church.  This is a prime example of how the church is run by man, who is not infallible.  I can’t help but see this as a problem.  These aren’t things that are mandated by God or even the Word of God, but by man.  Who are we to tell someone who wants to have love, or a woman who wants to devote her life to the church by teaching the populace the word of God that they cannot do it? \n\n",
        "Since the early 1900’s, the U.S. government has made marijuana its poster-child for its war on drugs.  It is the government that created such a negative hype surrounding the drug.  Just look at some of the movies that were made in the 20th century (”Reefer Madness” being one of the most famous).  These anti-marijuana propaganda films glorified the negative effects of marijuana and failed to acknowledge the positive ones.  This “marijuana is bad” sentiment has lasted up to the present day.  I think people should look at this issue with an open mind - after all, just because something is a drug doesn’t mean it’s a manifestation of evil.\nThere are plenty of drugs out there with effects much worse than marijuana that are legal for medicinal use (morphine, codeine, midazolam, fentanyl, dilaudid, methadone….the list is endless).  The majority of these drugs that are dispensed in a hospital every day are highly addictive.  Yet they are used because of their medicinal properties, which range from painkilling to sedation.  What separates these hardcore narcotics from marijuana is the fact that there is no aura that automatically distinguishes them as bad.  Marijuana does, in fact, possess properties that are ideal for treating several various diseases.  There really is no reason why marijuana shouldn’t be completely legalized for medical uses.\nMarijuana isn’t even addictive.  It may be bad for your health if used in excess, but so are most things - if used in excess.  Heart disease is so prevalent in the U.S. because of all the crappy food we eat.  If something like alcohol is legal, I think marijuana should be legal as well.  People will find ways to get it regardless of its legal status.  One thing that a lot of people don’t think of is that marijuana’s legalization will reduce some of the strain on prisons in the U.S.  A good number of inmates today are there because of possession charges.  The prisons in the U.S. are overpopulated largely because of these people who get caught with marijuana (after several offenses, of course).\nIn short, I think marijuana isn’t nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.  European nations like the Netherlands have shown that marijuana can exist in civilized society.  The model is right in front of us - all we have to do is follow it. \n\n",
        "I think that smoking marijuana is a dirty habit and I do not partake in any form of smoking. So, I do not care whether it is legalized or not, but I can understand individuals concerns with the effects of smoking on a person’s health. The effects from smoking listed do not seem as severe, but more bearable then anything. People who smoke marijuana crave more food and sometimes get dry mouth. There do not seem to be SERIOUS health effects. I feel that alcohol has more harmful side effects in long and short terms then marijuana. When people get high they usually do not hurt themselves or endanger others. While alcohol, on the other hand, makes individuals feel invincible, and easily persuaded to do things they would not usually have done. This discussion starter has made me wonder why alcohol is legal but marijuana is not- it seems that marijuana should be the legal substance.\n            Another good point the discussion starter made was about the revenue that could be made from the legal sale of marijuana. I would much more prefer to see the money here then in the underground markets. Also, if marijuana were legalized, maybe young people would not abuse it as often. It seems that there are more adults who use it sparingly, rather then abusing it. For example, my friend smoked for the first time with her mother a few weekends ago. Her mom wanted to experience this with her, so she did not think it was something “unaccepted” but to use it for what it is and not abuse it. I think the thrill was taken out of smoking marijuana when my friends’ mother joined her.\n            If there was ever a bill passed to legalize marijuana or if I had to vote someone in office to legalize marijuana, I still probably would not. There are valid points to legalize marijuana, but I do not do it and I would prefer if it remained illegal.\n",
        "I absolutely feel as though the Catholic Church has to change its ways in order to adapt to the 21st century. Two major issues come to my mind when I think of the Catholic Church; those issues are Gay marriage and abortion. I am a very liberal person and I see eye to eye with many of the political views held my leftist in the political world. Thus I believe that gays should be allowed to marry just as any other couple that is in love should have the right to marriage and obviously I also believe that women should have the choice to abort a pregnancy should the circumstance present itself. The church does not believe that either should be allowed and its justification comes from religious doctrine that was given or written for us thousands of years ago. I don’t want to seem like I am mooching the church but to be honest things change drastically in a matter of decades let alone in a matter of centuries. We have the proper medical procedures to perform abortions with out harming the women. Furthermore, to quote church doctrine that is older than time, and say that a man can not marry another man because in the bible it says that marriage is between a man and a women is preposterous. In the biblical times if somebody were to come out and pronounce there homosexuality they could be subject to blood letting or a lobotomy, you know to get the “gay out of them.” Heck if you want to go back even further there are numerous written accounts of homosexual acts within the Spartan male communities as well as with in the Greek schools for men. Older Spartans would regularly engage in acts of homosexuality with younger Spartans and it was perfectly permissible. This leads me right into my next topic which would be older clergy men, specifically priests over stepping their bounds and engaging in sexual acts with younger church going boys. What is the difference between Sparta and the churches in Boston where Priests were raping boys? In Sparta it was part of the culture, in America it is a clear act of rape preformed by a priest that is sexually uneasy due to years of celibacy and perhaps in many cases unrequited love. The Catholic Church needs to start to allow their priests to marry. It may seem ridiculous due to centuries of church rule against it, however, a married sexually fulfilled priest could perform his job just as well as a celibate one, and without the worry of perhaps raping a boy. Rabbi’s and ministers of all other religions are permitted to marry and live normal lives all the while devoting themselves to their work and their God. Along the same lines, women are also allowed to be Rabbi’s and Ministers, to not allow women to be Catholic Priests is a major gender discrimination that our country has overlooked for far too long. It is time for the Church to meet the times, steps need to be taken to modernize what is now becoming an outdated major religious movement. \n\n",
        "I’ve been an avid proponent for the legalization of marijuana for several years now and would like to expound on several points brought up by the discussion starter. The beginning paragraphs mentions marijuana’s legalization in other countries and later mentions that legalizing would reduce the stigma of the forbidden drug, but fails to draw a comparison between these points. What I mean is, the legalization of marijuana in European countries such as the Netherlands and Switzerland has significantly reduced the percentage of teen smokers. Now surely, if it were legalized in the U.S., a short term increase in use would most probably occur, but in the long run it would bring teen drug use down.\nHowever, while teen use and abuse of the drug is one of the main arguments against legalization for medical purposes, I would argue that marijuana should be legalized altogether, not only as medicine. Opponents of the drug cite long term health problems and psychological addictions as reasons for continued criminality of the drug, not to mention the belief that it is a “gateway” drug (a drug that leads to use of harder, more addicting drugs). However, none of these arguments are very compelling.\nFirstly, the long term health problems mentioned aren’t even proven scientifically as of now, and no scientific evidence even supports the grounds that marijuana can lead to lung cancer or other debilitating diseases. Even if there is a possibility of these long term problems, they would only be evident in heavy smokers (those who smoke several times a week) and even then, the tobacco in cigarettes is more dangerous. However, with a booming tobacco industry in America, criminalization of cigarettes would never even be considered by the U.S. government.\nSecondly, opponents have invented this bogus term “psychologically addicting” to further demonize the use of the drug. However, in simple terms, “psychologically addicting” means nothing other than that the pleasure received from doing an activity induces one to do this activity again. Hell, the first time I ate ice cream I liked it. In fact, I liked it so much I ate it again, and then ate it subsequent times after the second eating. Does that mean I’m psychologically addicted to ice cream? I don’t think so. If something is going to be labeled as addicting, then there has to be examples of users trying to quit but either reverting back to use or going through symptoms of withdrawal. This simply is just not the case with marijuana. If someone seriously wants to quit smoking, there’s literally none of the hassle that would be involved in alcohol, tobacco, etc…\nLastly, opponents also call marijuana a gateway drug, saying that it leads to harder drugs. However, the statistics for these allegations are completely convoluted. Sure, cocaine and heroin addicts smoked pot before they moved on to more addicting drugs, but this doesn’t mean anything. If marijuana didn’t exist as a drug, statistics for cocaine and heroin use wouldn’t change, and instead of smoking pot first, the addicts would simply try a harsher drug first. We should, in fact, be thankful that marijuana exists as a cultural vent for experimentation, because if truly 40% of the population has tried it, then without it’s existence, those experimenters would be messing around with much more dangerous and addictive drugs.  Let’s thank God that 40% of the population hasn’t smoked rocks.\nOne last point…\nDeaths attributed to marijuana use: 0\nDeaths attributed to alcohol use: too many to count \n\n",
        "Part of what makes the Catholic Church what it is and give it such a strong foundation is the fact that it is rooted in centuries of tradition and its influence is so wide spread. It was not until recently that they began experiencing any problems in the areas of celibacy and lack of interest. Changing these traditions now I think would take away from what the Church initially founded itself on and would also take an enormous amount of time. The change would also have to occur in the Vatican, which is no where near as far along as the United States when it comes to modernizing. Because of the national influence Catholicism has, change would take a great movement. However in contrast, allowing priests to marry and/or allowing female priests could possibly end the problems with pedophilia as well as spark more interest in priesthood. It does make sense that the Catholic Church should change with the times, but in doing so it would lose part of its identity. It’s kind of just a lose-lose situation. \n\nSo from my chat groups I learned that the tradition of priests not being able to marry actually comes from the 12th or 13th century. When priests would die, rather than leaving their land to the church, they would leave it to their children, therefore taking land away from the church. The church then instated the rule of not letting priests marry in order to maximize the amount of land they possessed, because now when priests died, they would inherit the land. So it seems as though this tradition of remaining celibate actually grew out of the church’s greed rather than some holy sanction. This kind of changes my view on things in that I don’t see the tradition of priests not being able to marry as something so sacred and in changing the rule, it wouldn’t really take away from the church, because it was started for a corrupt reason anyway. In changing this tradition, more people would be attracted to the priesthood and maybe the church would not be involved in so much scandal. \n\n\u001a",
        "Talking about a national ID system addresses a very tricky subject.  While it could certainly help the government in monitoring for terrorism, it does raise issues of privacy.  Personally, I very much agree with many of the ideas brought up by littlestanemone.  I feel that, as least from my perspective, I am willing to give up some privacy in order to prevent possible future acts of terrorism.  I have nothing to hide from the government, and therefore don’t really mind if someone happens to listen in to a phone conversation, etc.  To me, this partial loss of privacy seems like a small price to pay if, in the long run, doing so could help save the lives of others.  \n            On the other hand, the reality is that the government will not likely be listening to my conversations, as I don’t really fall into a target suspect group.  So although I state that I would give up some privacy, more likely than not, this phone tapping, etc. would not affect me much.  It would, however, affect minority groups, especially those of Middle Eastern descent and thus we have the issue of racial profiling and discrimination.  We have already seen this to be somewhat of a problem with The Patriot Act, with innocent people being investigated and sometimes falsely accused, just because of stereotypes.  \n            This said, I still am in support of a national ID system.  Although it might cause some inconvenience at times, I believe that it could help to better control who enters and leaves our country, as well as help in monitoring people once they are inside the borders.  I do, however, believe that the government will need to use extreme discretion in releasing any information obtained through this system.  It is very important that only necessary government officials have access to this information and that it be used only in an appropriate context of protecting our nation.\n\n\n",
        "In my opinion, the war in Iraq has gone on for way too long.  It scares me to think that more troops are being sent over, when we should instead be working on a way to pull out of Iraq.  The question of what exactly that exit strategy should be is a very difficult one.  On the one hand, I would love to see all of our soldiers come back home safely now.  But on the other hand, as much as I don’t believe in the way in which this war was started, I also don’t believe that it would be right for us to just leave right now.  The situation is such a mess right now because of what we initiated, and I feel that it would be wrong of us to leave after completely upsetting whatever political structure Iraq had in the first place.  Since we started this, we have a certain obligation to “clean up after ourselves” and at least try to restore some order.  However, I also feel that what we need to do in not take Iraq by the hand and wait patiently as it takes every little baby step.  We need to just finish our business over there in as efficient and timely a manner as possible and get out once we have done this.\n \nIn response to the discussion starter’s mention of the war in Iraq in relation to the war on terrorism, I am part of the 57% of Americans who feel that the Iraq War is not part of the War on Terror.  The war in Afghanistan was a direct retaliation against the attack of September 11th, 2001, but I believe that to try to make a direct connection between 9/11 and Iraq is not correct.  After our nation was attacked on September 11th, it would have been very strange of us not to have some sort of a response; this response was the war in Afghanistan and the attempt of find Osama bin Laden.  When Bush extended this fight against terrorism to Saddam and Iraq, he was simply playing off the fear instilled in Americans by the events of 9/11. \n\n",
        " “Critics of feminism claim that undue emphasis on “rights” and social and economic equality can undermine traditional family values.” What in the hell does that mean? Women shouldn’t be fighting for their rights because they will become lackadaisical with there family responsibilities. Women  are unknowingly discriminated against in that when they are stay-at-home moms other women look at them like they don’t know the what hard work is because they have to do is take care of the home and their kids. And the women who work all their lives and have missed their “prime” and aren’t able to have kids are seen as not completely the one thing they were put on this earth to do. What’s also disheartening about this situation is that women discriminate against other women. Women who are stay-at-home moms discriminate against “butch” women, and women who live the traditional heterosexual lifestyle discriminate against women who are homosexual. And the list goes on.\nGender discrimination has been getting progressively better over the years. Women and men have gone from the traditional roles of homemaker and moneymaker to many of them switching roles and maybe even both of them being the moneymakers. Slowly as the older generation, who are stuck in committing to the traditional roles in the households pass away, this new idea of switching roles and leaving childrearing to the end of their lives is gradually becoming socially acceptable.  \nAnd in response to LoColady’s last paragraph, I honestly was taken back when I first read that she doesn’t see herself having a family. I must say that I have always thought that women at least had it in their plans to have a family just not anytime soon. I recognize this as a problem and that with time my mentality will change. But what I did think or at least what came to mind when I read that she wanted to spend her life in building her career, I thought of the image the media portrays driven women as. Staying up late working in their offices and having affairs with married men or with men who are paid for their sexual services. They live, eat, and breathe their work environment. Why can’t driven women be portrayed as happy and content with the lives they have chosen for themselves?\n\n",
        "The main issue, on the surface, with the war in Iraq seems to be a lack of focus.  The war is losing much domestic support because it only seems to be a drain on American lives and money, which it may very well be.  In order for any positive notions to come from this war a new strategy and focus must be initiated.\nIt should be reiterated that the war was declared in an effort to establish democracy for a country that otherwise could not do so on its own.  Through the media and various other reports, the American audience has generally gained the perception that the war is now senseless, meaningless, and pointless killings.  The other focus that could be expressed is the fight on terrorism which is also encompassed under the general umbrella of building a governmental structure promoting human rights and liberties.\nIt would also seem that the billions of dollars invested in the war could be better invested in domestic endeavors.  Poverty, education, and healthcare are just a few of the many problems in our country in addition to the large debt the government has run up.\nCertainly another point to look at, especially when considering whether or not to continue the war effort, is the success of the Iraqi people.  If we were to pull out and have only gone half-way in our effort to establish a civilized government, the people could easily crumble back into chaos without a firm foundation.  For this reason, I believe the government should reconsider its strategy with the war and figure out how to reallocate resources in a manner that will efficiently help the Iraqi people initiate their new government structure.  The efficiency would ideally entail a quick closing to the war effort so as to conserve our money that could be used domestically.  The efficiency would also still make sure the Iraqi people are properly aided in their independence effort.\n\n",
        "The question of how to balance the emphasis between safety and security in our country in light of recent events is certainly an interesting question. Personally, I believe a national ID system would be very effective and helpful as a safety measure. Right now states don’t communicate well with each other about some things, as evidenced by the amount of criminals who manage to jump parole and start over in a different state. In some cases, they even end up being caught again in the new state for the same type of crime they were originally convicted of, which could be prevented if we had an effective national identification system.\nWhile I think national IDs are a good idea, I believe the amount of information made public about a person should be tightly controlled. If they were going to make criminal records accessible by looking up someone’s ID that is one thing; however, to have personal information like medical records stored for access in the same way I believe that would be an invasion of privacy. While it would aid in stopping the spread of diseases like HIV and AIDS, the end of medical privacy would do far more harm than good. It would be hard to believe that given access to that information, a hiring company would not refuse someone with a disease like HIV because they would worry about it making their other workers nervous. A system of national IDs would certainly be more effective than the Census for collecting current information about trends in the population.\nIf we go to a European style system of national IDs, we will have to tighten our regulations on who can access the information the government collects about us in the same way. No one outside the government should be able to access that kind of information without the express consent of the person it concerns. Right now, you can sign up on an email list for one company to send you updates or freebies and within a week your inbox will be flooded with junk mail from places you’ve never heard of. Such information selling is inappropriate and an inconvenience. I hate to think what would happen if companies were allowed to see information about the kinds of stores you visit or cards you apply for by accessing your national ID. In short, national IDs would make identification and security a much easier job for the government, but the access to the information they store would have to be carefully regulated. \n\n",
        "            The question of whether gay marriage should be legal cannot be addressed without a clear understanding of what it means to be married.  The term marriage has many different connotations, usually associated with a man and woman, but really, a marriage can exist between people of any gender.  In my opinion, a marriage is intended as a way of formally, publicly, and legally stating one’s allegiance to another person.  Marriage is a way of expressing love and union.   Marriage is a pledge to stand by another person’s side through thick and thin, good times and bad. With this view of marriage in mind, it is impossible to deny homosexual couples the opportunity to marry.  If two people of the same sex love one another in the same way that a man and woman love one another, why should they not be given the same rights and privileges?\n            One argument against gay marriage is that marriage is intended for procreation.  It may be true that many offspring are born as a result of marriage, but it is also true that our society allows for marriages that will not result in new births.  Such examples are infertile or elderly couples, who will not be having children, but are still allowed to get married.  Also, many unwed women are having children in today’s day and age, which means that marriage is not a necessity for procreation.  For these reasons, it is unfair to deny homosexual partners the chance to get married based on the fact that their union will not produce offspring.\n            There is really no good reason to not allow gay couples to get married.  In an era where tolerance and acceptance are praised, it seems counterproductive to be so limiting in our views of homosexuals.  The only way to truly promote tolerance and justice is to be accepting of all other kinds of peoples, and to not oppress them by denying them rights.  To have gay marriage be illegal is a form of oppression, because it is inherently unfair and biased.  Therefore, it is very important to stay open-minded and permit legal marriages of gay couples. \n\n",
        "Have you ever been made fun of or criticized because you were the only boy around or the only girl around? Speaking from experience, it makes someone feel awkward, exposed, and like they do not belong, like they are not good enough. Recently, I was at the FAC late at night to play basketball with a bunch of male friends. We were all excited to play until I entered the gym. It was full of boys, only boys. They began to play without me because they only wanted to play with my male friends. They did not even give me a chance. Just because I was a girl, I was automatically not good enough to play with them or even against them. I felt terrible about myself. However, my male friends stood up for me and said that they would not play unless I could play with them. So, we eventually played against them and won by a landslide, it was almost embarrassing. I felt so great about myself and the friends I had. This experience made me realize that there are still people in our society today that still hold feelings such as these against the opposite sex. But, at the same time, it made me realize that their are people, like my friends, that do not have these feelings, that the world is slowly changing and adapting to this change in society. Women are now equals and have been for a long time. They are getting higher paying jobs and higher educations. They are now becoming mothers and CEO’s. The average age that a woman gets pregnant has went up about six years. This means that women are staying in school longer to receive higher educations. This process of acceptance is still in the works but in a few years, it will eventually pan out. \n\n",
        "The question at hand is “should the catholic church change it’s ways?” In my opinion, I leave that decision up to the catholic church. While I do agree that some of the practices and beliefs are outdated and conflict with many views of the rising society, it is not really up to me nor anybody outside of the catholic church to make that decision. However, I do believe that it would be a good thing if they were to change their ways and become more accepting of lets say, priests marrying.\nI born and raised into the catholic church and as I became more politically and socially aware I decided to leave the church and go my own way. Personally I felt some of the ideas encouraged in the church to be much too restricting. For one I did not agree on the churches stance on homosexuality. I also was not too fond of the idea of the “confession booth.” If god is supposed to forgive all, then how come I need to talk to a priest about it?\nAnother thing I did not approve of was the hierarchy within the church. We are all supposed to be perceived as equal in god’s eyes, so why is one man holier than me? It is almost hypocritical for them to say that all people are equal yet this man holds a title of nobility. Perhaps I just am more able to notice these things because of the society I live in and the peer group that I grew up with. Who knows, but to me some of these practices seem out of times, yet the church is persistant in their technique, and this has begun to strike up conflict with the progressing society around them. (such as gay marriage)\nNow one change I would suggest is allowing priests to marry. This I feel would severly reduce the amount of paedophilia incidents within the church. Priests are human beings as well and they are prone to human nature as well. It would be a lot safer and a lot more moral for them to have a reasonable outlet for their “sexual tensions” rather than have to resort to horrifying means. Though it is true that not many priests are like this, but it would still make a heavy impact if marriage was left as an option.\nThere is not much else that I would suggest though because for every argument I would present it would go against something within the catholic teachings, which may in fact be asking too much. It would be like asking them to change a whole concept that helps to build their foundation. Any change they want to make is in their hands. It would be nice to see them change and adapt at least a little bit further towards the current mindset, but I don’t feel that anybody should force them to. \n\n",
        "I believe the war in Iraq was a huge mistake that America got itself caught up in due to politicians taking advantage of the country’s emotional response to 9-11. The whole thing originally started out as a hunt for Osama bin Laden, and then grew and grew until it involved invading Iraq. Emotions were built upon and played on every step of the way, making it seem as if waging an all out war in a foreign country with little support was the next logical step.\nNot only was the decision to go to war in Iraq not well supported, it was not well planned. There were no definite goals besides “Get Saddam out of power!”, no plan for rebuilding the shattered government and economy of the country we invaded. This is why we find it now difficult to pull out – because we’re still not sure we’ve accomplished what we went in for. Yes, Saddam has been executed for his horrendous crimes, but is the state of Iraq any better than before we came? On the contrary, it’s even worse. Like many other Americans, I was under the impression that the entire reason for the war was to make the world safer. Well, as far as I can see, invading Iraq hasn’t done a thing. Terrorist attacks will always happen, and the best defense against them is not invading any country which spawns them, but rather continuing what we have done to heighten security at our country’s most vulnerable points. So the war in Iraq has not bettered the world yet – has it bettered Iraq? From what I hear in the news, Iraq is in more turmoil and conflict than it was under Saddam’s entire reign. Who was the war in Iraq supposed to help?\nI agree that something had to be done about Saddam Hussein, and that trying to oust him from power was an admirable goal. But we went in practically alone, removed a foreign country’s system of government and tried to institute our own in its place. I think what the Bush administration didn’t account for in this “plan” was that Iraq has a completely different culture from our own, and that forcing a policy of democracy on them when their own society is so heavily ingrained with tradition and religion is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. I believe the only solution now is to plan out a gradual withdrawal of troops from Iraq, with definite timeframes (at least to shoot for as goals). We are the glue that holds together the government in Iraq right now, and hopefully if we withdraw slowly and completely a new force from within will rise and take our place to hold everything together. \n\n",
        "I constantly am in debate about how I feel about gay couples. I would never hate anyone for being gay, nor would I praise them for it. I would never look down upon the lifestyle, but I’ll never support it either. I know gay people, and I am also starting to see it more and more on T.V. For instance, there are gay couples on those dumb dating shows on places like MTV. While I respect gay people, there’s no way I can watch them kiss or show any other type of intimacy in anything- like movies, shows, etc.\nNow even though I can’t watch that stuff doesn’t mean I’ll treat those people differently. It is for this reason that I see hope for these gay couples that want to be united with each other. To bring the church into the picture is stupid- stop doing that. Change the stupid name to a “civil union,” don’t call it a marriage, and you’re done. If these people want to be recognized within the church, then that’s their problem to personally deal with. Even if the church is against gays, I know priests that are all for it. After all, these gay people aren’t going to be going to the Pope for mass every sunday…\nA marriage is a union within the church between a man, woman, and God. That’s not my opinion, thats what it is. Let it stay in the church…I think that everyone who plans on staying together forever should be united under the law to get the government to recognize the union. Everyone would be united, but only the few that fall under the Church would be married. What’s the big deal? The people who want to be “married” and recognized by the church need to stop complaining. Some may also say that if the gay couples aren’t “married” then they would be treated differently in a negative sense. In one way, shape, or form, they will always be treated differently- or at least for a loooooooooooong time. After all, what they feel is not normal (by that I mean not even close to the majority of people)\nAs for the government, it has no place telling people what to feel or what and what they can’t do based in this field. Who do they think they are? if they think it’s morally wrong, then don’t talk to the people and stay within whatever group you’re in that doesn’t like it- but don’t go out of your way to discriminate against them, etc., etc.\nCivil Unions are fine, but leave marriages to the church… \n\n",
        "When discussing the issue of privacy rights, one must first define both parts of the dichotomy that is the idea of information with permissions, namely the terms of public information and private information.  Public information represents the realm of information corresponding to that which is public, or accessible to all people, with no prerequisites attached to grant permission to access that information.  If anyone were to enter information into this realm, the information would be deemed public, meant for anyone’s eyes, for anyone to achieve without any prior permission.  On the other hand, private information represents the realm of information corresponding to that which is private, or accessible only to a select few, chosen by the party presenting the current information.  If anyone were to enter information into this realm, the information would be deemed private, meant for the eyes of the select few, chosen by the party presenting the current information, for anyone to achieve who has prior permission.\nNow possessing these definitions, we can begin to evaluate the legitimacy of information based solely on which realm it is taking from.  For information that derives from the realm of public information, that information can be legitimately used by anyone for just means.  Online forums, such as a public MySpace, fall into this realm of information.  If anyone were to collect any information about anyone on a public MySpace, that information could be used against that person for just means.  For information that derives from the realm of private information, that information must be discarded and branded as illegitimate by origin.

        "Well to start off, gender discrimination is obviously a bad thing. However, it is embedded into our culture and even the world, so getting rid of it will not be an easy task. In fact, it won’t end within our lifetime or any time shortly afterward. Am I just being a doubter? No, this is just the way I feel it will be.\nI feel that a lot of current “discrimination”  is not such a bad thing when considering things such as jobs. For instance: a construction worker vs. a secretary. Men are generally better at construction due to their body types, and women are better at multitasking- that’s general knowledge. Now I do feel as though men and women should be equals in everything, but I can also see how people look at the opposite sex in certain areas and say “what are they doing there?” because of natural make ups and tradition.\nFor instance, I am a male secretary. Weird, right? I openly admit that the job does not incorporate my masculinity WHAT-SO-EVER, but I’ll also say that I shouldn’t be talked down to because of my job. I feel as though it’s alright to joke about though- a humorous form of talking down- I’m cool with that. In fact, I’ll be the first person to joke about my job. I’ll say that I get pinched in the butt, etc. (doesn’t actually happen, mind you…) and nobody really cares- they think it’s just funny.\n-Another point that I would like to bring up is that although many people feel as though women should be treated as equals, many do not feel as though women should be up for the draft. This is a very “wishy washy” topic, but it is something to think about as well. I personally think that everyone should be up for the draft (if implemented) who are physically qualified, but I also think that it is more of a male’s job at the same time. I feel this way just based off of tradition combined with a male’s natural body type- I would never look down upon women because of this though- perhaps I am just used to seeing male soldiers as I grew up with G. I. Joes, etc.\nOver all, I feel as though this country (not the entire world yet) has come a long way, and is doing a great job at defeating gender discrimination, but it will take a long time before any more big changes happen. \n\n",
        "I believe that it is time for the Catholic Church to change its ways. We live in a society that is fast paced and always changing. It is time for the Catholic Church to update their beliefs to fit with what the current society needs.\nThese days we hardly ever here of young men entering the priesthood. Although still looked on as a position of respect, there are few who decide to devote their lives to it. Why is this? Many would argue that the Catholic Church does not have the following that it once did. In the generations that preceded us church was regularly attended every Sunday by most Catholics. Now, I can’t name more then a handful of people who still dedicate themselves to go every week. Can this lack of incoming priests be related to a lack of following?\nAnd what is causing this decline in faith? There are some practices of the church that are very outdated. The Catholic Church does not believe in birth control, but there are times when natural family planning is not going far enough. In the case of a woman, of childbearing age, who has four children and cannot support another, is her only choice abstinence? Also, the church does not condone the lifestyles of homosexual men and women. The gay community in America as well as other countries is rapidly rising. This goes back to our discussion on gay marriage. If it is decided that homosexuality is a genetically decided factor in our lives, is it fair to tell these men and women they can’t follow a particular religion?\nOn the other hand, the Catholic Church can’t be too quick to change (and they haven’t been.) If the Church changed their beliefs with every passing fad, no one would find the need to believe in it at all. But now, in our time, there are certainly some adjustments that could be made by the Catholic Church.\n\n",
        "i agree with both sides of the argument in that I understand why heterosexuals find it hard to accept or tolerate the idea of gay marriage. but i feel that what they fail to realize is the homosexuals arguement that many homosexuals would not be on such a sexual rampage if they had the opportunity to settle down. I mean think how many families would be there to adopt all of the foster children and provide them with a family. Also I feel that what people dont recognize is that a marriage has nothing to do with a man and a woman in the dictionary a marriage is clearly defined as a union between two people who share a sexual and domestic relationship and live within the same household. I dont understand why heterosexuals feel so against gay marriage because of the idea that they cant make children naturally. If you think about neither can a man who has a low sperm count neither can a woman who has sterile eggs. Invetro-fertilization and sperm banks were made so people who weren’t born with the natural ability to reproduce could have that chance. \n\nShakespeare said, “Would a rose but my any other name still smell as sweet.” I believe the problem with allowing gay people to marry is because of the title marriage. Because our country is run by people who based their whole lives on the Bible they can’t help but be uncomfortable with the title gay marriage. I also feel that gay people are mainly looking at the benefits that are received in the title of marriage. If they allowed the title civil union and still set in the benefits of marriage, I believe everything will be a little better.\nAlso I feel that the government is looking to indepthly at the situation of marriage. They are trying to look at all these different angles of what marriage is and all I think they should be focused on is that it is a union between two people. And even though homosexual couples can’t have biological children, there are many ways to still have children, in-vitro-fertilization, having sex with a man, and adoption. Our government is so stuck on preserving the natural roots of marriage that they struggle to accept that there may be a different kind of love between two people of the same sex.\n\n\u001a",
        "\n\n   When it comes to gender discrimination, I do feel that it is still\npresent in socitey. It is something that has been going on from the\nvery begining of time, and I am not really sure if it will ever\ncompleatly go away.\n   When women finally got the vote here in the USA, it was after the\nAfrican Amaricans, wich is ironic being we had the whole civil war\ngoing on at one point trying to argue that they should be kept as\nslaves (wich we rightly judged that they should not, and i am glad of\nthis fact!) However, women, even though they were white were not\nallowed to vote until after the african american men could. Actually,\nwhite and african american women were lumped together in this case in\nthat neither were allowed to vote untin the 1920s at the same time.\n  With this bit of history, we have clearly come a long ways, yet there is\nstill many things that keep women down. There is the theory of the\n\"glass roof\" in some jobs, were women can only be premoted so high, and\nthen can never really get to the full top because the men in society or\neven the views of other women keep them down. It is getting to be a\nlittle more common to see women in the top positions, yet most CEO's or\nBosses are still the men.\n   I being a woman would like to think that I can rais up into the career\nof my choice as far as I would like to go without any bounderies. I\nwould like to feel and think that in these positions or in any position\nthat I might have or obtain, I would be respected just as much as a\nmale would. It is here that we come to our first problem.\n   Women are still often thought of as the parent that should stay at home\nand raise the children and shoule be under the rull of the man of the\nhouse. Or at least this used to be the majority of thinking.\n   Now a new type of gender discrimination I feel is starting to evolve,\nand it does not have to deal with women under men, but women against\nwomen. It is now starting to be that if you are a mom, it is not\nenough. You should not only rais a family, cook, and take care of them,\nbut you should also be involved in clubs, activities and have a part\ntime job. If you are not able to fullfill all of these requiremnets,\nsome women are looking down on those that dont and feel that because\nthey are they are better and more supirior. It is an odd concept, but\nture. I guess it is the balencing of a sacle really. As soon as women\nstart to gain acceptance into a male dominated society, other women\nstart to look down on you if you are not taking every opportunity that\none can. THis is not just in teh united states that i see this but\nstreaching accross the ocean to the UK as well.\n   Men are also discriminated against when it is the wife in the family \nwho seems to be the one who is earning the money. A father should be\nrespected for staying at home and taking care of his family if that is\nwhat they choose to do, yet ofthen stay at home fathers are looked down\nupon, wich is sad. ONe should not be judged for what they do if it is\nnobel, such as taking care of thier children and family.\n  Do I see any way of changing these prejucices? Unfortunaly not\novernight, but I feel only time will tell what happens next.\n\n",
        "\nI am all for gay rights. They should have every right that any\nheterosexual person has. However, marriage is a sacrament of the Church; a\nspiritual bond between a man and a woman recognizable by God through the\neyes of the Church. It is not that the Church does not accept gay people,\nit does not look favorably on gay acts hence the fact that they would not\nsupport gay marriage. I do not support gay marriage but I do support gays\nbeing together like a married couple. They just have to use a different\nword besides marriage. I do not understand why it is important for the gay\ncommunity to be \"married\" in the eyes of the Church, an institution that\nhas made it clear that they do not support their way of life. The states\nthat have legalied gay marriage I think are over stepping their bounds. I\nthink this is between the gay community and the Church not Bush and not\nthe States. I think Bush should have nothing to do with this issue. He is\nimposing his personal views on the subject on the entire country which is\nwrong and unjust. Gay marriage has nothing to do with the federal\ngovernment. However, if the gay community decided to use another word and\nbe recognized by the state as a couple, then I think it would be alright\nfor the State to step in and legalize it or not legalize it and for the\nFederal Gov to support it or not.\n\n",
        "Oh boy.  This is one of the few topics that I myself am divided on.  Not\ngay marriage, but the very issue of homosexuality itself.  As for gay\nmarriage, I'm all for it.  Why?  Because I don't care what the homosexuals\ndo.  Why should I?  Why should I care what anybody does except for myself\nas long as what they do does not hurt me personally?  I dunno.  I've been\ntrying to figure out why conservatives care so much.  Don't they have\nbetter things to do than to worry about the \"gay problem?\"  If your\nparticular church thinks that gay marriage is wrong, then they can decide\nnot to allow it.  If you believe in gay marriage, then this church is\nprobably not the one for you, because it clearly goes against your morals.\n So join another church that supports your beliefs.

But don't try to ban gay marriage in the\nconstitution.  That's the stupidest goddamn thing I've ever heard.  First\nof all, the constitution is about ensuring rights not taking them away,\ndumbass.

        "What is the purpose of the Church?  What is the role of any religious institution?  I think that religion builds faith, and faith is something that becomes part of a person.  The Catholic Church is a foundation for the lives of many of its members.  Church doctrine and Church teachings remain a source of constancy and stability in a fast-paced, unpredictable world.  The  Church holds many opinions based upon these beliefs and these teachings that find a great of opposition in the 21st century.  The doctrine of the Church is pro-life in all situations; it is against abortion and the death penalty.  I certainly hope that these stances do not change.\n   You see, the foundation and the heart of the Catholic Church is the teachings of Jesus, and these have endured for 2,000 years and hopefully will endure for 2,000 more.  The Church interprets these teachings and applies them to the contemporary world.  This is the role of the Church, a role that I do not think should change.\n    However, The Catholic Church is so much more than doctrine.  The institution of the Church, the hierarchy that governs it, is completely composed of men.  This I do have a problem with.  For an institution that advocates the dignity of every human person and equality among them, where is the dignity and equality within their own walls?\n    It is important to note  however, that women play a very important role on a smaller scale, in the everyday activities of individual parish communities.  Because there is a lack of Catholic priests, lay people in general have taken on more religious and administrative responsibilities, and many of these lay people are women.  But we cannot ignore the fact that women are not allowed to become deacons, priests, bishops, cardinals, or pope.  There are several other religions that allow women to hold positions of leadership.  Protestant Churches have female priests.  I can only see the inclusion of women as beneficial to the Church, especially since there is such a shortage of priests.  Also, I find it much harder to believe that any women would wstand by quietly while they knew a fellow male priest was sexually abusing young children.  Perhaps these atrocities would have been discovered much sooner with women in some sort of position of power.\n    Should priests be allowed to marry?  The Protestant religions allow this.  The Catholic Church in rare circumstances allows this.  For example, if a married Protestant minister converts to Catholicism and wishes to become a priest, he is usually allowed to do so.  Maybe there would be more priests if they were generally allowed to be married.  But I agree with the Catholic Church on this point.  A priest, and any other person who belongs to religious order, must be willing to devote his entire life in service of God and the people of the Church. I just don't think that they would be able to do that if they also had the responsibility of a family.  The teachings of the Catholic Church should not adapt to the fast-paced, self-absorbed world of the 21st century.  But the institution is a few decades behind in the implementation of equality between the sexes.\n",
        "In my opinion, if you are posting something on myspace, it's not private.  Myspace is a site that allows any other person who has an account to access your page, so if a creepy old men are able to acess a myspace page and stalk young girls, then school official should be allowed view the same information. If the student who posted the plan on the site really wanted it to be a secret, he wouldn't have exposed the plan in a place where anyone could have access to it. Also, in doing this, the school was able to prevent a very serious event that could have been fatal for many of its students. If I was attending that school, I would much rather my life be saved by an invastion of privacy, than having the school mind its own business and I not  make it home from school that day. I think that doing such things as searching students backpacks and lockers is an invasion of privacy, but if you are spilling your business on a public online site, you are just asking to get caught.\n",
        "\nI believe that every side is entitled to there owm opinoin on gay marraige\nbut that doesn't mean that they should limit the other side either. If you\ndon't like gay marriage thats fine but that doesn't mean that there are\npeople out there who aren't gay. Personally I believe that everyone should\nmind there own business, people are so concerned with what everyone else\nis doing that they are geting side-tracked. Especially the government,\nthey are so worried about who should marry who that they are not thinking\nabout more important things like the war in Iraq. I bet you that many of\nthe soldiers over there are alot more concernend about safely evacuating\nIraq than about if gay people should get married. Also I believe Bush is\ntrying to ban gay marriage because he is trying the stick to the\ntraditional foundation that has built this country. But slavery was a\nfoundation that built this country, and that is now illegal. Moreover my\npoint is that it shouldn't matter who we are allowed to marry, if there is\nlove in the relationship why should people who don't like it care? Because\nit looks weird and its different? Well alot of stuff looks weird and\ndifferent but that doesn't mean we should shun it. And further more aren't\nhomosexuals granted the right of a civil union, which is the same as a\nmarriage except for the benefits? Well if thats the case then they  should\nbe at least happy that they got that far and work toward geting the whole\nU.S. to give them that right. Because if you think about it there are ways\nto get all the benefits of marriage, its just alot of paperwork instead of\nautomatically getting it in marriage.\n\n",
        "I think the legalization of marijuana would be an unwise decision.  Marijuana is a harmful, addictive drug that even if used in small quantities can cause many health problems.  Most importantly, marijuana is the gateway drug to more serious, dangerous drugs.  Most people who use illegal substances use them as a result of their previous marijuana.  Legalizing marijuana would only put more people in the downward spiral of addiction by making the drug more easily available.  Marijuana is much more addictive than alcohol and leads to other drug use, unlike alcohol, so it is reasonable for alcohol to be legal and marijuana to be illegal.  One of the main problems in enforcing a law like the one in Denver is limiting the legal quantity of marijuana and defining small.  Overall, it would be best to keep marijuana illegal and avoid the problems associated with this harmful drug.\n",
        "I believe that war in Iraq has gone on for far too long.  A just cause for going to war would have been to aid another country in need of governmental assisstance.  If our true purpose, as the United States, was to help Iraq restore a Democratic government then the cause, in my eyes, was completely justified.  For whatever reason there are countries in the world that have fallen in to regimes that inflict a great deal of unjust power on their citizens and the regime, over time, has been enforeced and engrained in to the society so that it is very hard to break or even see that it is wrong anymore.  The United States was completey right in starting the war and helping to break down the tyranny so the citizens could experience a more liberating government.\n\nIf, however, the government chose to go to war in Iraq for more personal reasons dealing with President Bush's family history with Sadam Hussein, then it was completely unjustified.  There is no reason that an entire country should go to war and spend numerous resources for a cause that stems back to personal bad blood between two men.  There are far better uses to our country's resources than a war for unjust personal reasons.\n\nSince we have already gotten our point across that we wanted to spread democracy, I believe our retreat has been long since overdue.  The point has been made and we are now wasting precious resources on foreign soil.  We are having problems with our social security system, poverty, and many other things on our own soil, yet we are spending billions of dollars to fight a war that has lost any sort of meaning or purpose.  At some point the officials in Iraq need to take the reigns back and take the government over for themselves, and the sooner the better so they do not become dependent.\n\n",
        "The argument dealing with privacy issues bears down on two fundamental topics:  the medium of communication and the content of the communication. In this case the medium, myspace, was a publically accessible website and the content was life-threatening.  With such a combination it is very hard to create an argument supporting privacy rights for thsi situation.\n\nIf the medium for this communication had been through a private phone line or an e-mail, that part of the argument would have been much more controversial and easier to offend for privacy issues.  If people intend their message to only reach one or a selected other number of individuals such as in a phone conversation or e-mail, then they have a degree of right to privacy.  If, however, they post their message on the world wide web on a site that billions of people have easy access to, then they are only ignorant if they believe they have any sort of privacy rights.  Their message is easily viewable and it is completey their responsibility because they made it viewable to the general public.\n\nIf the content of the information has to do with a prank or plans to hang out with friends on a Friday evening, then privacy right are certainly being broken.  If the purpose of seeking out this information is of such an informal purpose as one of the examples aforementioned, then privacy has been broken.  We, as a society, need to find some sort of boundary between simply prying in to others' lives and actually seeking out useful and pertinent information.  Since the information in the case had to deal with human safety and a threat to other lives, it was certainly pertinent information to seek out.  The society and its laws has been put in to place in order to protect its citizens, and certainly privacy laws are no different.  So privacy laws must be defined on these two principles of medium and content where if the medium is not intended to be private and the content is absolutely pertinent to the safety of human beings, then the law would support that pursuit by law officials.\n\n",

It is not worth risking my brother's life and the lives of all the other military we have over there for the little progress we are making in the country.

        "Good question.  I absolutely do feel that women are discriminated against\nin America.  In the workplace, at home, everywhere.  Here's the kicker\nthough.  Do I think this is a problem.  Nah.\n\nHere's the funny thing about discrimination.  What the word really means\nis the ability to make distinctions, or discernment.  And here's the\nthing, if America is headed in the direction where we can't discern the\ndifference between a male and female, then we are headed towards disaster.\n\nNow I'm not saying women don't have a place in this world.  I love women. \nThey are very useful for many different things.  Really, if there weren't\nany women, not only would our species come to an end, but I in particular\nwould be a mess.  You see, I can't really cook at all, and I don't\nparticularly like cleaning either.  I mean, I can clean, if something is\nreally grossing me out, and I could probably learn to cook too, but I\nreally just don't want to.  You may say, well Tyler, why don't you just\norder out, and hire a maid service?  Well, I'd say, ordering out does get\npretty pricey, and also I don't want cleaning people in my house that I\ndon't know.  They're a sneaky people.  They'd rob me blind.  So that's out\nof the question.  So really, unless I want to live with a very feminine\nmale roommate for the rest of my life, getting married is really the best\noption.\n\nI see that part of the question asks about discrimination in the\nworkplace.  I don't really know what that's all about.  I don't see what\nwomen need to work for.  That's what I do.

One of my main issues with the church is that most of its rules\ncome from the Bible.  The Bible is a learning tool ,not a set of laws. \nNot only that, but the Bible was written by man, and man is prone to\nerror.  God did not write it.  Not only that but if there is a God would\nhe really denounce the fork?  At one point Catholics denounced the fork\nbecause it was a \"tool of the devil\".  Also the Bible was put together by\na man that did not become a christian until he was on his deathbed.  I\nunderstand that the Church has views of its own, but many of those views\nare horribly outdated. Women are no different from men in their ability to\nbe spiritual leaders.  We have women in positions of power in every other\nwalk of life, why not in the Catholic Church. Another bone to pick is\nabout priests.  The concept of celibate priests was not originally in the\nChurch.

        "Dear CMCC Study-\n\nThe federal debate over gay marriage is asinine. Constitutionally speaking, I believe it's a matter which should be left to the States.\n\nMy feelings about President Bush cannot be described in polite terms, so I won't go there.\n\nThe erroneous line of reasoning that concludes that the banning of gay marriage will protect \"family values\" is also absurd in itself. First of all, in order to follow this logic, one has to first posit that there is a coherent standard for what can be considered \"family values.\" This ignores the plethora of cultural norms and values present in American society, and therefore begins on false premises. Second, the conservative push for \"family values\" is ridiculous in itself. Mark Foley, anyone? Government funding for South American countries to slaughter their own peoples during the Reagan Administration? Economic policies which consistently widen the gap between the top and bottom of the wage-earning spectrum? These don't really jive with any notion of \"family values.\"\n\nOur country is predominantly homophobic. The ability for gays to get married in civil ceremonies wouldn't have have any practical negative consequences for our country. The right would involve just that: civil ceremonies. People can go on holding whatever uptight ideas they please within their own religions, which have nothing to do with government sanctioned unions.\n\nPeace,\n#6\n\n",

        "\n   One the issue of gay marriage, I belive that it should not be leaglied.\nNow let me first clarify what I mean by this. Marragie in the eyes of\nthe church is between a man and a woman before god. Those of the same\nsex can not participate in such actions because the Bible and the\ncatholic church do not recognize this form of unionization to be legal.\nThe reason is because a man and a woman can produce children and thus\nhelp populate the world and spread the word of God.\n  Those of the same sex can not produce children having the same organ\nsystem makeup, and thus are not considered a compleate whole or union in\nthe eyes of the Lord. I compleatly agree with this, however I do belived\nthat those of the same sex should be able to spend the rest of thier\nlives together and have the same governmental benifits as regular\nfamilies.\n  In other words, I belive that those who are of the same sex should be\nunionized but in a different way. If they so wish they can have their\npartnersip recognized by a new name as well other then marraige (because\nit is not a marraige) but have it sound more meaningful then just the\ndry term of civil union.\n   In reality, this is mainly what most same sex partners want anyways.\nTHey want a way to solidify thier \"love\" for one another in the eyes of\nothers, and they want to be able to acces all of the benifits that\nnormal male female relationships and marragiaes have.\n   In regards to whether President Bush should be allowed to pass an\nAmendment banning Gay marraige, I do not think that this should be\ndone. I again, dont think that there should be gay marraige (as said\nusing this term) but under a different term I am ok with it. However,\nwith President Bush passing an Amendment banning gay marraige it is\nalmost making it seem that one is not free in this country any more.\nONe should be able to choose who they wish to spend the rest of thier\nlife with and not have to worry how others judge them. with an\namendment, even if they did find a way to solidify thier union working\naround the amendment, I feel as if they would be looked down upon even\nmore in society then it is already today, and this should not be so.\n  THe Federal government should not be involved in people's personal lives\nin regards to stating who is allowed to be involved or be partnered with\nwho. If this were the case in the end, I fear that the book by George\nOrwell of 1984 would be coming to life with the \"Big Brother or Father\"\nthing going on.\n  Oh, on another point, the reason why marraige between a man and a woman\nis more solidifying in the eyes of god, is because they are able to\nreproduce and thus even if the initial \"passion\" for one another dies\nout, they have children that they are now working together to rais in\nthe eyes of the Lord. THose of the same sex can not do this and so\nofthen thier relationships tend to dye out after the passion has gone\naway.\n  To sum up what I belive, I believe that those of the same sex should be\nable to be unionized under a different term then marraige and taht the\nfederal government and president bush should stay out of the sistuation.\nI also believe that once this universal differnt term to name the union\nbetween same sex couples is passes, all states should honor it.\n\n\n\n",
        "The war in Iraq is the hardest issue for me to comment on, due to my lack of knowledge of what exactly is happening overseas.  I think the general public as a whole, no matter what they think they know, isn't aware of most the details of the Iraq War.  There has to be some discretion on the matter - the government has to keep some information private for the sake of national security.  However, in the post 9-11 days it was uniformly decided to invade Afghanistan, and after the general public lost interest, somehow we slipped into Iraq.  There are very many reasons that Saddam should have been taken out of power (namely the violent atrocities he performed on his people), but I'm not sure if it was our place to do it.  Finally, I don't know if I can support a war where we can't see any end, but kids younger than me are dying.\n",
        "I am happy to hear of this news.  First of all, I personally think MySpace should be taken down from the internet, because there are so many kids under 13 blatently lying about their age to gain access to a profile.  After they do this, they then state their real age in the summary of themselves! With so many underage profiles, a red flag should go up about\nthe morality of such a site. About the school shooting, good for the school administrators!  Invasion of privacy my ass, if these kids are stupid enough to document every single detail of their life in public domain (ie anyone can join and read it) then they should get caught.  Schools shouldn't draw any line short of illegally gaining access to online info of their students.  The prevention of the school shooting is proof that this kind of monitoring works.\n\n",
        "I think that marijuana should be legalized not only in Denver but in all of the United States. Most  people who would want marijuana to be legalized are \"pot heads,\" but I can honestly say that I have never smoked pot. Almost anyone who has smoked pot before would not be against its legalization. To state the opposite, most people who never want it legalized most likely have never even tried it before. I believe that the people who don't want marijuana legalized are afraid of the drug and its affects on its users. I actually think that the affects aren't bad at all. If you look at what it does to you, then I would be surprised if you would still dislike the drug with a passion. Here are somethings to consider: -It calms down the user\n-it slows down one's movement\n-a lot of times it makes you happy\n-It has apparently never killed anyone\nIf this drug is legalized along the same lines and circumstances as alcohol, then mostly good things would come out of it. Instead of violent/drunk parents, the \"abusive\" parents would be calm and stoned (they would ignore children, but it would still be better than physical abuse). Given, I do not know a lot about the drug, and this is only based off of what my friends have told me. In relation to alcohol, the drug can definitely be treated as something very similar. Laws should limit it to adults over 21 years of age, you can't have it in a car at all in an opened bag, etc. The black market would decrease if it were legalized, and \"bad batches\" would not be smoked. As a closing statement, the government might as well make money off of it since a huge amount of America's youth already does the drug. Taxes on this could be used for schools, etc. which would benefit our country in general. Basically, the good affects of marijuana and its legalization would totally outweight its bad affects on its users/the country.\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nID # 20\n\n",
        "I do feel that the Catholic Church needs to change some of its ways to adapt to life in the 21st century.  Most of the \"rules\" that are stated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church were created years and years ago.  Many of them are now outdated.  Times have changed and things are not as they used to be.  Also, mostly the rules that were set forth were created by church officials.  They are not these all-powerful laws commanded by God; they were created by a political institution.  For the church not to change simply means that it is losing more followers. In today's world, it is difficult to follow strictly to every single rule set forth by the Catholic Church.  I feel that many people thus adopt an \"all or nothing\" approach:  if they don't feel that they will be able to stictly adhere to every rule, they will just not be a part of the Church.  This is really harmful to the Church.  Today's young people are growing up earlier than the youth of past generations.  That means that they face issues such as whether or not to engage in premarital sex, etc, at an earlier age than past generations.  These issues thus become more prevalent. I have gone to Catholic school my entire life.  I know MANY people who are baptized Catholic, but I know\nvery few people my age who truly believe in everything that the Catholic Church believes in.  With such highly debated issues as abortion, stem cell research and the use of contraceptives, there are more and more ways for people to have differing opinions.  People don't want to just be forced to accept and believe a certain philosophy because \"that's what the Church says\".  I think that by the Church not relaxing its views at least somewhat, it is losing touch with today's youth.  This is not to say however, that the Church should just forget about everything that it stands for.  We still need to promote morality, but some of the \"rules\" of the church are much harder to abide by in today's world than, say, a century ago.  We must remember that a just few centuries ago, the Catholic Church was a major political instituion in Europe.  So, many of the laws that were set forth were put in place by political officials who were interested in furthering the Church's political motives, not necessarily in enriching the lives of believers.  The Church has seen many corrupt leaders, and we should not be forced to still abide by laws that were put into effect by people who had only money in mind. As for the issue of pedophilia by priests of today, I do think that some of this could have been prevented had the Church relaxed some of its laws regarding entry into the priesthood.  For example, many of the men who were accused of pedophilia are around the age where they entered the priesthood a couple of decades ago.  Even since then, the times have changed and it has become more socially acceptable for people to be open about their homosexuality.  But back when these men entered the priesthood, even if they  knew that they were gay, it was not really socially acceptable for them to make this announcement.  But they would not want to get married to a woman, because were homosexual. So, since it would be somewhat strange for a man to not get married, man of these gay men saw the Church as a safe haven.  It was a place where they could live with other men.  I am not saying that all priests are gay, but I do believe that a good number of them are.  I am also not saying that all priests or all gay priests will thus become pedophiles, but I think that many of the men, as a result of their positions as priests, were put into situations which would be very tempting to them. I think that priests should be allowed to marry.  Yes, I know that an argument given by the Church is that Jesus was not married, so priests should not marry either, but there is new evidence coming out that it actually is possible that Jesus was married.  Regardless of whether or not this is true, however, I still think that priests should be able to marry. If priests were married, they would be able to better relate to a good part of the congregation.  Also, the numbers are decreasing of the number of men entering the priesthood, and I think that an excellent way to bring these numbers back up would be to allow priests to marry.\n",
        "Stupid debates like gay marriage and abortion are doing nothing but\nstalling our political process, hogging media attention, and distracting\nus from policy areas where our priorities should really be.

        "    If one school shooting was prevented by delving a little into someone's myspace, that is enough justification for the action. I do not think reading a post that a person intentionally put up on the internet is an invasion of that person's privacy by any means. However, if someone uses illegitimate means to collect information that was never permissably released by the person being researched, that is a breach of privacy. School officials should not attempt to access private information about any student. On the other hand, any publicly posted information (such as myspace, facebook, etc.), in my opinion, can be legitimately used for any good reason by anyone.\n",
        "I think that alcohol has a more potent effect than marijuana. Marijuana seems to relax individuals. It seems normal for guys to drive when they are high, but then they would never drive when they are drunk. Weed seems easier to obtain then alcohol, which is strange because the easier one to get is illegal. I think any form of smoking is unnecessary..people are just killing their lungs, so if cigarettes are legal, then they might as well make weed legal. But then, on the other hand, when I think of weed and the people that smoke it, I consider them \"dirtbags\". So I do not think that would create a good image. If we legalized it people would take advantage of it. We seem to overly consume everything..so I take back my previous statement, because if weed was legal, there would be no moderation, just like there is no limit for alcohol.\n",
        "I definitely feel as though the war in Iraq has gone on long enough. What began as a war on terrorism has turned into pointless killing of our troops. No progress at all has been made in Iraq, and once Sadaam was out of the country, there was really no other justifiable reason to remain. It is obvious by the way the Iraqis are treating our troops that they no longer want us in their country and I think it is time Bush admit defeat and bring them home. He has lost so much respect and support by keeping our troops there and the best thing to do is to let them return to their families and for us to go about our own business instead of medling in the business of others. We have our own problems to fix here at home so there is no sense in trying to fix the problems of another country, especially one that does not want our help. We have wasted billions and billions of our tax dollars on a pointless war and it is about time we accept defeat and bring everyone home. We are doing no good there and people are dying for a lost cause. We are making about as much progress here as we did in Vietnam and the Gulf War. Just think of the lives we could have saved if Bush had made better decisions and knew when to cut his losses.\n",
        "This is possibly the biggest waste of the court's time ever.  I fail to see, time and time again, how a bulletin posted on a public website for tens and probably hundrends of users to see could be considered private in any way shape or form.  Even just signing up for a Myspace, you are informed that your website is subject to inspection and censorship by the owners - no part of myspace is truly private.  The very act of posting a bulletin shows that he didn't want his actions to be private - he wanted others to know about and read about them.  The issue here is that the wrong people (school officials) came across a notice that was otherwise public property.  You can't defend your mistake of not being careful by saying they invaded your privacy by catching you in that mistake.  If the post was on a private, password protected site that only you had the keys to and shool officials hacked in, then a case could be made.  Still, kids post things every day in their web sites and blogs and expect other people to read them.  The inference of the kid posting a bulletin was that he expected other people to read it.  Just because he got in trouble when people fulfilled his expectations doesn't give him a justification for his defense.\n\nSchool officals should draw the line at actual private property.  Search and seizure of a purse's contents is different from a review of a student's public website.  With a purse, there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.  A purse is used outside of school in many situations.  Myspace is not used for anything but communication with other people. \nNoone creates a Myspace and adds no friends and just keeps it for themselves to look at, and noone posts a bulletin on Myspace without expecting other users to read it.  It's the same situation as passing out fliers at school that say \"IM BRINGING IN A GUN TOMORROW!!!\"  If a school principal happens to pick one up and freaks out, you can't say \"Hey, you had no right to read that because I was only passing it out to my friends!\"  The fact is, the responsibility of school offials to keep the students in their care safe has always and will always outweigh the privacy rights of students.  School officals have more leniency even than the police because a school is supposed to be a safe and sheltered environment.  If kids think they are constantly in danger, how can they learn?  If parents don't think offials are doing a good enough job, they will switch their kids to a different school.  Parents and the government support the school system in doing what it takes to protect their children.  Anything brought to school should be under the authority of the school to search - purses, backpacks, locker contents, notebooks... bottom line, if you don't want it to be seen by school officials don't put it withink their reach.  This means realizing that school officials use the internet as well, and even if they don't other students may turn you in.  This was just a stupid decision by one kid that school officials were well within their rights to crack down on.\n\n",

        "I think we should never have gotten involeved in the War in Iraq in the first place, but now that we are we have certain responsibilities to take care of before we leave.  It was not exactly a good decision to get involved in a full scale war without support of any other countries or the UN.  If that many other governments are rleuctant to get involved, what made us think our reasons were overpowering?  Well the threat of weapons of mass destruction for one.  Weapons of mass destruction which mysteriously no longer exist.  Oil was another, and I don't see a way that we can deny that.  Our government made rash decisions in the defense of the US economy, not US society and safety.  We took it on ourselves to invade another country and mold it to our specifications, instead of going through diplomatic channels to work out a solution.  Our problem was not only rashness, but impatience.  True Iraq was ingoring UN orders in the time shortly before the war, but I feel it could have all been worked out with a much better, safer solution.  Third party intervention was a must between the US and Iraq at that time, and there just wasn't a strong enough force holding us back.  All of these factors, as well as anti-Iraqi sentiment generated by the government, contributed to us getting into a royal mess rivaling Vietnam.  But now that we're there, we have to think critically to find the best way out.\n\nThe problem with people who advocate an end to the war and withdrawl of all troops from Iraq immediately is that we are so intricately entangled in the whole ordeal that it is much more complicated than staying or going.  I feel the war has gone on long enough indeed.  Saying it's over doesn't make it so.  The war will never be over until we slowly remove troops over time and start rebuilding by a different process - through diplomatic channels.  We can do more good for Iraq from far away than we can by staying smack in the middle.  Sometimes you can't see the forest through the trees - we are losing perspective and the big picture the longer we stay in Iraq.  What we need is to remover ourselves from the situation slowly and look at it objectively.  We need to remove the USA from the equation entirely - right now we are looking at Iraq in terms of life here, and trying to fix it so that it fits our image of what life should be like.  Instead, we need to look at life in Iraq now in terms of the way it has been previously.  It has changed indeed over the past few years but it will never be what we want it to, for the simple fact that Iraq is NOT the US and never will be.\n\nI feel sad when I think about the war because I think it is a prime example of how emotion gets in the way of rationality.  Because everyone was so riled up and angry after 9-11, Bush was able to raise enough support for a war against Iraq.  This move had probably been considered by politicians for years, but the time was finally right.  We now not only had economic issues at stake in Iraq, but also humanitarian ones with Saddam Hussein's abuses and security ones with the weapons of mass destruction.  As a country, we made bad decisions during that time.  Now we need to do what is necessary to change our image in the eyes of the world, and to prove that we can be rational and mature.  We need to be responsible, to admit that this has gone too far, and to ask for intervention on the part of the UN to mediate relations between us and Iraq because the direct route isn't working, and hasn't worked for a long time.  When something isn't getting you the results expected, \"change is the future\", don't just \"stay the course\".\n\n",

        "\nI do think gender discrimination still exists but its not as one sided as\nit used to be. Back in the day gender discrimination was mainly emphasized\ntoward women. Women could only have jobs as secretaries or jobs that\nrequired helping; no real authority. Now I believe both men and women are\ndiscriminated against because of their gender. I see this in the fact that\nmen are looked down upon if they want to be a stay at home dad or work as\na secretary or a nurse. Why do men always have to have the power? For\nexample I would like to be a nurse practioner in the emergency room, and\nmy main reason for wanting to be a nurse practioner instead of a doctor is\nbecause I don't want all the responsibility and I want to have a family\nand a life outside of my career. I feel like men can't want what I want,\nthey can't not want responsiblity and authority afterall isn't that what\nis ingrained in our heads as a child, men are the head of the household,\nthey bring in the money.\nOn the opposite spectrum women are also discriminated against in the\nworkplace but its not as obvious. There are laws now that prevent women\nfrom  being discriminated against but that doesn't mean that people don't\nfind ways to get around those laws. I believe that women in most\nconservative businesses have to work twice as hard as men do who have the\nsame criteria as they do in order to reach there level.

        "Dear CMCC Study,\n\nYes, of course gender discrimination is still and issue in the United states. It's derived from a mindset our culture has inherited from millenia of paternalistically structured Western societies.\n\nI believe that gender discrimination, at it's root, stems from ingrained cultural patterns, so any work to change it must begin at a very basic level. This means that it will take a long time to accomplish. I believe the work of feminist writers and theoreticians from throughout the 20th century have given us a good starting point, particularly those that deconstruct biased notions inherent in the linguistic norms of our language (the use of phrases like \"mankind\", or the preference for male pronouns when making general statements, for example). Basically, what I mean by this is that working against gender discrimination is a matter of changing attitudes, and that laws really only help on a superficial level.\n\nYes, women are still discriminated against in the workplace and in other places, as are men (though not as frequently). I think that the percentages of women in higher-level positions in the workforce and in politics is still very revealing. And not to sound like a conservative pundit, but there is such a thing as \"reverse discrimination\" as well. While it is rarer, occasionally qualified men do receive the short end of the stick when it comes to promotions and things of that nature because of \"politically correct\" considerations.\n\nPeace,\n#6\n",
        "    I feel that much of the negative attitude toward marijuana, and other drugs for that matter, stems from the illegal drug trade around the world.  Having a drug legally available for consumption turns it into a whole different story.  I have a summer job working in a hospital pharmacy.  One thing I don't think people realize is that a drug is a drug.  Many of them, including the ones in the hospital, have harmful side-effects that are far greater than those of marijuana.  In fact, our pharmacy stocks THC, the hallucinatory ingredient in marijuana, in pill form.\n    I'm not saying that marijuana should be made into an over the counter drug.  It would have to be prescribed by a doctor of course.  There are many other drugs that are available for use with prescription, such as Percoset, Vicodan, and other opiate derivatives.  These drugs are highly addictive, but marijuana is not.  Yet they are legal and marijuana is not\n    If a drug has some benefit (and marijuana does) I think it should be utilized.  As far as it being available to the general public – like alcohol for example - this would not be a good idea.  You can't just go out and get prescription drugs at the store, and I feel that marijuana should be placed in the \"prescription drug category.\"  I feel that the legalization of medicinal marijuana should not only be allowed, it should be encouraged.  However, marijuana should not be available to the general public because of the negative side effects on health, regardless of age.  It would be abused.  There's no way to get around that.\n",
        "I think that whenever you post anything on the internet, you have to be aware that what you are posting can be read by pretty much anyone.  If there is something that you don't want EVERYONE to be able to see, then you should think twice before posting that information.  So if you put something online in your mySpace, you should know that MANY MANY people will be able to see it.  For this reason, I don't really think that it was an invasion of privacy for someone from the school to have read a bullitin that indicated there was going to be a shooting.  If the student posted this information on the internet for all to see, then they should have been aware that it is possible for anyone to read it.  I don't personally have a mySpace profile, so I am not exactly sure how the privacy settings work.  I can only speak from my experience with a Facebook profile.  I do have a Facebook, and I have currently have my settings so that only \"friends of my friends\" at Loyola can see my profile.  So if accept a friend request from someone, any of their friends who go to Loyola will be able to see my profile as well.  I initially had it set up so that anyone at Loyola could see my profile, but I recently restricted it further.  There are stil a large number of people that fall into the category of \"friends of my friends.\" So I know though, that any information that I post on my profile can be viewed by many different people.  It is sometimes tricky to figure out what information I want to post, and what I don't.  For example, I have my AOL Instant Messenger screen name and my campus address on my Facebook profile.  This information is posted because I would like people from my classes or my friends on campus to be able to contact me or to stop by my room. However, I don't really want EVERYONE in the world to know my screen name or where I live on campus, because that is kind of dangerous.  But I am taking that risk by posting that information online. So if a student posts something online, the information is available to a wide group of people.  If a student has written something threatening about a school shooting, then I think that it is great that a school official happened to see it and was able to prevent lives being lost.  I'm not sure how exactly the school official came across the student's message though.  It would be kind of weird WHY exactly the school official was looking at students' profiles anyway, but I am glad that they were able to save lives.\n\n",

I don't think it is right of Mr. Bush to push for an amendment to ban gay marriage. I am not totally comfortable with it, because it is so different to me, but I feel that in situations like these, you just have to put yourself in the other persons shoes. What if straight marriages were banned? What if the norm was gay marriage? And I was the odd one out? I would be very upset.

By legalizing this drug,\nwe would be helping to cut down on this industry and thus help lower the\nrate of crime.\n  On the other hand, I feel that once marijauna is legalized that it still\nneedes to be regulated. We can not have people driving all around the\nplace on the road high, because the accident rates of moter related\ndeaths would sky-rocket. Just like alcohol, one should not be able to\ndrive while high as they are not allowe4d to drive drunk. There should\nalso be an age limit on the drug\n   It doe impair judgment and it does make people high, just as alcohol\ndoes, and thus one should be at the age when they know what is\nappropriate usage of the drug and what is abuse of the drug. If someone\nuses the drug too much they can probably loose brain cells, just as if\nsomeone drinks too much.\n  THat being said, I would like to point out some of the bennifits of\nmarijuana. It does help those who are suffering from glocoma by helpong\nto releave some of the pressure off of the eyse and put them at a more\ncomfortable state. It is not prove to provoke a dependence as alcohol\ndoes, and thus can be stopped at any given time, instead of those who\nbecome alcoholics.\n  I also believe that as in smoking, there should be rules on where\nmarijuana can be used. many people do not like the drug and so there\nshould be no smoking of it inside of buildings or in public areas such\nas sidewalks. Parks are a differnt matter in that one can simply move\naway from a location that they smell the drug in. there needs to be a\ntype of respect that developes between those who use it and those who do\nnot, otherwise there could be a significanly drastick dividing line\nbetween the two groups, and it is best to keep everyone happy.\n  so if marijuana was regulated, then those who do use it will feel as if\nthey are getting the best product for their money, becaus they will know\nthere is no filler in the drug. They will also have to respect others in\nthat they have to watch where they smoke it because not everyone wants\nto smell it. THey need to obay all laws set in motion by the government\nsuch as age limit on who can buy the drug and when or when not to drive.\nOther then that, I feel as if the drug should be legalized much like it\nis in canada, becaus that seems to be working out quite well.\n\n",
        "   One of the most recent headlines involved he bipartisan Iraq Study Group, who recently published a report which emanded several things that go against Bush's agenda.  The report called for a definite timetable (15 months I believe) for the complete removal of American troops from Iraqi soil, as well as direct interaction with Iran and Syria.  Obviously, this group feels that the war has gone on long enough, and that it is time for the Iraqis to take the matters of their country into their own hands.\n    There should never have been a war.  President Bush invaded Iraq under false pretenses.  He claimed possession of proof that Saddam Hussein, the leader of Iraq, was in possesion of weapons of mass destruction.  However, no such weapons were ever discovered.  And what about the nations who actually admit to owmning nuclear weapons? Shouldn't we invade them too?  Well, the U.S. can't invade itself, but what about North Korea?  It seems to me that there was obviously much more behind this invasion.  Bush also made this war into a war against terrorism, playing on the angry emotions still left over from the terror attacks of September 11th, 2001.  But most of the terrorists came from Saudi Arabia and countries other than Iraq.  I think that oil and money were the reasons for the invasion of Iraq.\n   Bush also advocated the spread of democracy as a goal of this war.  If he knew his U.S. history, he should know that almost 100 years after the Revolutionary war, the United States was still fighting against itself.  Democracy takes time, and it takes even longer when it is forced upon people.\n So many American soldiers have died in Iraq.  No more should have to die.  But if the U.S. pulls out too soon, what did thousands of American soldiers die for?\n  I think that President Bush has demonstrated several errors in judgement  throughout his two terms.  In his military decisions and in his appointments of advisors he has chosen quite disasterously.  Therefore, I think it would be wise to follow the reccomendations of the Iraq Study Group.\n",

        "The war in Iraq must be stopped immediately. Since the war on terror began way back in 2003 only more terror has been sustained in Iraq.  The streets of bagdad are more dangerous than ever, and bombings and killings have only increased as our military occupation has been prolonged.  With our \"new plan\" in place to send even more troops over and to refuel our military reserves here in the states, one can only imagin just how many good american will be lost in this trivial act of self affirmation that our president has embarked upon in the middle east.  But what happens when this is over, ok so iraq might not be a threat any longer but terror sure as hell will be.  Iran, North Korea, Lebenon, Lybia, to name a few are all terror driven countries that have more military power than Iraq and still have militaristic dictators in charge.    The war in Iraq has gone on long enough, it has become a quagmire only comparable now to Vietnam and our presidents record low appoval ratings fairly accurately depict the state of the union.\n",

        "I have written about this topic twice already, chatted about it online,\nparticipated in group discussions, and recorded a telephone \"monologue\"\nabout it.  I'm probably going to restate almost exactly what I've already\nwritten at least four times.\n\nOkay, so the moral implications of legalizing (or even wide-spread\ndecriminalization) marijuana aren't really something the US is ready to\ndeal with.  I feel like the illegality of marijuana contributes to its\nnovelty in the eyes of adolescents and teenagers, and if it were to all of\na sudden become legal, they simply wouldn't be able to handle themselves. \nThere would be no sense of moderation, there would just be a \"wahoo! pot\nis legal!\" craze in middle schools and high schools across the nation. \nThis wouldn't be good for anyone.\n\nHowever, conversely, the illegality of marijuana costs a great deal to\nfederal, state, and municipal legal systems each year.  When it comes to\ncost-cutting and political budget-balancing, I'm sure we could find better\nplaces to cut expenditures than the illegality of marijuana.  However, the\nprospect is there, and with a national debt hovering at around $30,000 per\ncitizen, this detail seems a bit more relevant.\n\nAll in all, I don't think marijuana should be legalized.  However, if\ncancer patients want to smoke it, let them smoke it.  They are dying of\ncancer.\n",
        "I think the Catholic Church has been in a constant process of growth ever since its conception.  It's not like it has never changed - The Protestant Reformation and Vatican II are examples of two massive overhauls in Church doctrine and practice.  Yet there are lots of issues today that the Church is not addressing properly - tradition is not a good answer to the issue of women preists or gay marriage.  It doesn't attract people to the church when they hear that women can't be priests because 2000 years ago people were not enlightened enough to listen when women spoke in the name of Jesus, so he picked men as his apostles instead.  Everyone knows that that has changed, and they want the church to reflect the new status of women in the world.\n\nPope John Paul II did well in his time as Pope to bring the Church into the new millenium.  He made the Church more accessible to common people, and by visiting other countries as a sort of ambassador, in effect globalized it.  In this era of global trade and world economy, it was good to have a Pope who spoke the languages of so many people, and who showed obvious love for each one of them.  But the doctrines of the church are much more entrenched and hard to change than its public image.  Supporters of strict laws in the church can find evidence anywhere in the Bible supporting their ideas.  But perception of the Bible has also changed over the years - it is no longer accepted by many as literal fact, ever since the Scopes Monkey trial.  In fact, among many theologians and Biblical scholars, it is widely accepted that the Bible should be viewed realistically - as a book of meaninful stories and lessons created by Church leaders to unify and teach their followers.  If the Bible were to be created today by the same leaders of the church, it would undoubtedly be different in many, many ways.  So why should we keep basing our lives on the \"laws\" written in a book centuries ago, in another place and time entirely?  The MESSAGE of the Bible is what's important.  Love your neighbor, do unto others as you would have them do unto you, God loves you etc, not \"a man is unclean for 24 hours after he has lain with a woman.\"  That one went out the window... so whats keeping the law where gays should be shunned and stoned taken as the word of God himself?\n\nIn regard to the issue of pedophilia, there is nothing the church could have done or changed to prevent that.  A pedophile is a pedophile - it is a psycholigical illness, not just repressedsexual energy.  I think that rather than a good proportion of priest becoming pedophiles, a good portion of pedophiles became priests to try and control their urges.  They probably thought the church would give them stronger morals and convictions, and that they would be able to control their thoughts and actions better as priests.  Instead, what it did was give them even less supervision (hey, everyone trusts a priest) and even more freedom to be alone with small children and to fantasize about them.  Allowing female priests and married priests would probably enhance the quality of life among priests, but would not make any greater or smaller percentage of them pedophiles.  What the church could have done was to keep a closer watch on the health of its priests.  I'm sure none of them entered the priesthood saying \"Oh boy, this will give me a chance to have sex with kids.\"  They probably felt extreme guilt over their feelings and actions, and probably would have sought help for it if they thought they would be supported.  I'm sure none of these men were particularly bad people, they just had psychological problems and a lack of control.  If priests could be assured that they could get psychological help whenever they needed it, and not necessarily from other priests but from real doctors, then I think the incidence rate of occasions like this would go down.  Also, the curch should not have covered up incidences when they did occur, but gotten help for the involved priests and let the public know in a timely manner.  Instead, the whole thing backfired on them and the newspapers got to have a grand expose.  The church should change many of its own internal customs and rules, and that includes trying to always be judge and jury.  Sometimes people just need outside help.\n",
        "I believe in protection of ones privacy.  I would not want the athletic director at loyola looking on facebook seeing a picture of me drinking and then being suspended for the act.  That would be invading my privacy and for no purpose.  However, that all being said any time another persons life is at risk or life in general is at risk i believe in any means necessary to stop it.  So if its facebook invasion or myspace invasion then yes, i agree with it.  You can never be to careful when dealing with crazy people.  But for petty drinking and smoking punishments that are found on these open forums for peoples information, i disagree strongly with that.  Porpper discression must be used by the powerful people checking our websites, that is where the line should be drawn.\n",
        "    The Catholic Church could certainly use some changes in the modern times we live in.  Allowing female priests and allowing priests to marry would certainly prevent any pedophilia from occurring amongst priests.  However, I think people in general give the Catholic Church a lot less credit than they really deserve. There are many good men out there who have chosen to be priests.  The media, in broadcasting so much about the pedophilia incidents and making it seem more widespread than it really was, hurt all of these innocent men. While the pedophilia was not as widespread as everyone thought, I am sure that some changes to the church will keep these incidents to a bare minimum.\n\n",
        "\nMy best friend went to college this past year and she began smoking\nmarijuana. And so to scare her I wanted to find out if there was any\nparticular cancer or disease that you can get from smoking marijuana and I\nfound nothing. Marijuana is a product of the earth, it doesn't hurt the\nbody you can't get lung cancer from it, there are no toxins in it that can\nharm the the air and other people. So I couldnt tell her to stop because\nit wouldnt harm her. My only problem with marijuana is that it wastes your\ntime. In the time it takes for someone to get high they have to sit there\nand get off there hgih which could take hours.\n\nIn the question you mention about the effects of marijuana, like I said\nbefore I dont think there are any other affects according to what I have\nresearched.

With that being\nsaid, Im actually up in the air on my oponion of the legalization of\nmarijuana in that is doesn't harm anyone it just wastes away peoples time\nbecause once they feel that high they tend to not want to do much of\nanything else. But also if we were to legalize it, would people stop\ntrying so hard to get it and the excitement of getting it would go down.\nBut then that goes to say should we legalize other drugs like speed and\ncocaine...I dont think so!\n\n",
        "The Catholic Church does need to change its ways to adapt to life in the 21st Century.  This must occur in areas such as social life and scientific endeavours.  Many of their requirements such as no meat on Fridays during Lent or necessary attendance of church once a week have long since lost their true meaning.  The main idea is that people practicing the faith will take in some of the core values of the Catholic Church through these actions; however, they have become what many would describe as monotonous and meaningless.  There should be refreshing and more directly applicable ways to experience the values the church wishes to give to the followers.\n\nIn the realm of science the church especially needs to come to the modern world.  When the church was founded over a millenium ago there was barely an existence of science as we know it today.  Over time, however, there have been great advancements for humans in the field of science revealing many new truths.  Many of these truths actually go against reasoning or \"truth\" the church held early on or had as a part of their religious scripts.  One such example is evolution and the creation of the universe.  There has been great scientific studies proving that evolution exists and that the creation of the universe came about from the Big Bang Theory as opposed to the obviously fictional stories in the Book of Genesis.  I believe there is a loss of credibility when the church refuses to apply reason to such scientific evidence.  It would certainly not take away from their core values and beliefs.\n\nChanges as they pertain to priests should be very minimal.  I believe that the priests, in addition to being officials of the church, are examples for the people practicing the religion to follow.  They are extreme examples in many cases because of the certain vows they take, but nonetheless Catholics can take away less extreme values from the priests to apply to their lives in an effort to aim towards a better life.\n\n",
        "Dear CMC Study,\n\nI think the primary reason that marijuana is illegal is because the government can't tax it. It's long-term effects are no worse than those of cigarettes (and some would argue markedly better), and the immediate effects it produces are similar to those of alcohol. I think that the other major reason it's illegal is because it has a social stigma attached to it, which is a little ridiculous when you examine the other behaviors society is willing to look the other way on. Denver has made a brave and ultimately very good decision. Even from a logistical standpoint, courts are frequently overwhelmed by cases of petty drug charges (and so are prisons, oftentimes), and a law like that helps to lighten that load in the long term. I think that if the government were to begin (trying) to strictly regulate the drug traffic and to legalize small amounts, as Denver has done, it would be a much preferable situation to the one they're dealing with now.\n\nPeace,\n#6\nYour Agent in the Field\n\n",
        "Marraige is a right that belongs to one person just as much as it belongs to the next.  Homosexuals and heterosexuals alike should be given the opportunity to marry whomever they choose.  Nowhere in the founding American  documents is it written that marraige is to be solely between a man and a woman.  The US government has no grounds for banning gay marraige.  Gay marraige should be accepted everywhere without question. A constitutional amendment banning gay marraige would be intolerant of heterosexual Americans and would be unfair treatment.  Such an amemdment would be outrageous and would likely be widely opposed.  The marraige of two individuals who are in love and choose to spend time with one another should not be the affair of any government.  Love is between two people and two people only, whether that be a man and woman or two people of the same gender.  In all cases, eveyone has the right to solidify their love for and committment to another individual through the binding act of marraige.\n\n",
        "    While gay marriage is a touchy political subject, I don't understand why some people are so opposed to it.  Their main argument against gay marriage is that it corrupts the American family unit.  To this, I say: Look at all the married couples who get divorced – the American family unit is far from perfect.  I think allowing two people of the same sex to marry would actually reduce rates.  This is because gay people currently have to endure so many hardships if they want to get married.  If they choose to get married, or seek marriage, they will have to face a lot of criticism from outside sources.  As a result, gay couples will be less likely to get married on a whim, as many straight couples undeniably do.\n    If people learn one thing during their time on earth, I think it should be that all people are different.  Homosexuality is not a \"life choice.\"  Gay people are simply attracted to the same sex.  True, they comprise the minority of the population when it comes to sexual orientation, but society should still accept homosexuality for what it is.\n    If gay marriage does become legal, who is it going to hurt.  You are going to see gay couples anywhere you go, so you can't escape reality.  Gays aren't out to take over the world, they simply want to have the same rights as heterosexuals.  To make them a separate class of individuals is cowrdly and childish.  It's the year 2006.  We need to accept people for who they are.\n    My uncle is gay, and he is just like everybody else (except his sexual orientation).  My take on the whole gay marriage situation is:  It's not that big of a deal.  If two people want to get married- let them.  End of story.\n",
        "I do not feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the present day United States. This may be because I have not been out into the \"real world\". I held a part time job in high school for 5 years and the only time I felt singled out as a girl was when I was unable to work past 7 o'clock. There were two valid reasons that I was not allowed- first, I think 14 year olds are only allowed to work a certain number of hours, and my boss did not want to leave me alone with the older boys working there..because after hours our store was dead! (I'm glad I had that restriction!) Once I became a freshman in high school I was able to work the rest of the night. At this job, I actually felt that the guys were discriminated..girls never got in trouble. The same mistake could be made by both a guy and a girl, and the guy would get fired. Once again..this was my store-very different from most. I mean...I guess I have been taught that there is discrimination towards women..I don't know by who, but I always grew up feeling like women were second best to men.

        "I do feel as though the Catholic church is a bit outdated and should adapt to the 21st century. I feel that in doing this, it would have prevented many of the events that have tarnished the reputation of the Catholic Church. In allowing priests to marry, the church most likely could have prevented the occurrances of pedophilia because they would have had a way to express themselves sexually and in an appropriate manner. The Catholic church is still operating in pretty much the same manner and under the same system it has since its creation, and considering how far society as a whole has come, the Catholic church should greatly considering modernizing with the times. You don't really see these same types of problems in other denominations of Christianity, so I think this goes to show that modernizing would benefit the Catholic Church more than harm it.\n",
        "I've been against the war from the moment we entered it.  When I first heard news of an invasion of Iraq, I asked myself, \"What did they have to do with 9/11?  Shouldn't we have our focus on Osama Bin Laden?\"  I had no clue how President Bush had even come to the conclusion that Iraq had \"weapons of mass destruction,\" but now it is apparent that is sources were flawed.\nWhile it's impossible to say that the invasion was all bad, considering we removed a brutal dictator from power, it still doesn't cancel out all of the negatives.  The thousands of lives lost, the families of soldiers on both sides, the innocent lives taken are all to remove a dictator and leave a country in a larger state of chaos than it has been in a long time.  We have gotten ourselves stuck in a situation, trying to impose our own system of government on a group of people whom a great amount of do not want.  It's like trying to fit the square block in the round hole.  It just won't work.\n",
        "    I do not feel like gender discrimination, collectively, is an issue in the present-day U.S.  There may be examples of discrimination here and there, but I think the vast majority of employers do not use gender discrimination.  In this day and age, it is simply not wise for employers to practice gender discrimination.  If it is apparent that they are doing this, they will find themselves facing a lawsuit that they are likely to lose.  It just makes good business sense to be an equal opportunity employer.\n    I do think that women use gender discrimination as a crutch in modern society.  Many women want to be equal in every way, shape, and form as men.  Biology will teach us, however, that men and women are physically different.  There is no disputing this fact.  As a result, men tend to be stronger than women.  Consequently, there are jobs in which men are preferred over women because the worker needs to be strong.  Man employers who need a strong individual will choose a man over a woman.  This is not because of gender discrimination.  The employer is just being smart.\n    Gender discrimination is a thing of the past.  Employers today don't want to waste their time discriminating against women - they simply want good results.  Sometimes the way to achieve these results is to hie a man - who is stronger - over a woman.\n",

        "I feel that the legaliation of marijuana in Denver based on the amount is\nnot such a good idea. I believe that this drug is similar to alcohol in\nthat it gives you a high and impairs your judgement. I think that if they\nwere to even think about the legaliation, they should base it on an age\nrequirement like they do for alcohol. I have recently read that marijuana\nhas not yet been proven to be extremely harmful to the body if it is done\nevery so often, not on a day to day basis. However, it has been proven to\nbe a \"gateway drug\" to more intense, powerful, harmful drugs such as\nheroine and cocaine. I think that they should legalize it because it would\nallow the authorities to focus on more important things and I feel like\nless people would be compelled to do it because it would no longer be a\nthrill. From most people that I have talked to who smoke marijuana, they\nonly started because of the aderenaline rush that they got from doing it\nbecause it was illegal.

        "I am ashamed to say that I know very little about the situation with the war in Iraq.  I don't really follow politics that much and am not very in tune with what the current situation is.  My thoughts on this topic will have to relate more to the events of Septemeber 11th and how that lead to the war in Iraq.  After our nation was attacked, and we started the war in Afghanistan, I felt that that war was justified (or at least justified as much as you can justify war, which is a whole other issue). The facts were that we were attacked and we were waging war in Afghanistan in an effort to find the people responsbible for attacking us.  It would have been very strange for us NOT to have had some sort of a response to such a major attack.  However, it gets somewhat more tricky when we move to talking about the war in Afghanistan to the war in Iraq.  I will try to explain my views as best as possible.  After the events of September 11th, we were really on the watch about other possible terrorist attacks or attacks of any other kind on the United States.  So when ideas surfaced that Saddam Hussein might have biological weapons in Iraq, naturally our attention was aroused.  However, with the whole issue of Saddam not allowing United Nations officials to search Iraq, the issue became even trickier.  We were very nervous that Iraq was lying and the fact that they refused to let UN officials search made us even more suspicious.  So naturally,we wanted to find out for sure.  But we did not have permission from the UN to wage war.  I think that one of the points of an instituion like the United Nations is to prevent such situations from escalating into war. However (and I am a little unsure about the chain of events that took place here) I think that what happened was that time was starting to run out.  It was taking so long to gain approval from the UN and it began to look like we wouldn't get the approval after all.  Then, we were afraid that if there really were weapons of mass destruction that Iraq was hiding, we could be setting up our country for disaster if we did not do something about it.  So we have on our hands a very difficult decision.  I know that this is the point where many people bring up the issue of oil and say that Bush only wanted to go into Iraq to get oil.  But we ARE in Iraq now and have we really gotten oil out of the situation??  Anyway, think of what would have happened if we had NOT gone into Iraq, and then it turned out that Saddam had weapons that he then used on the United States.  Imagine if we had not done anything about it and had just sat back waiting to be attacked? Now, the situation over in Iraq is difficult as well.  By going in and removing whatever form of leadership and government existed, we have completely taken away any form of a political structure.  The citizens of Iraq were living under horrible conditions, so in many ways, we are making their lives better.  But now, it is a big mess over there.  I think that it is up to us, since we were the ones that went in an took out their political stucture, to stay there to finish out what we have started.  We started the mess by going into Iraq in the first place, so it is thus our responsibility to finish it and make sure that everything gets cleaned up. At the same time though, enough American lives have been lost already and I would hope to see more troops coming home and the United States finishing up its business in Iraq as soon as possible.\n\n",
        "I don't think the Church is outdated to the point where people feel isolated from it, therefore I don't think it needs to be changed immediately.  However, if the members of the Church agree that some of the practices are becoming archaic and uneffective in modern day, then change would be appropriate.\nThe pedophilia scandal is a shame, but it's the priests fault.  The Church is made up of humans who aren't perfect, and sometimes downright evil in the case of the pedophiles. However, priests have managed to do OK for centuries without raping little boys, so these people have no excuse.\n",
        "Gender discrimination is still a big issue in the present-day United States.  It is hard to ever fully recover from a great disparity.  Just as African Americans were once oppressed and continue to face discrimination, so will women have a difficult time being seen as equals to their male counterparts.  With a history of inferiority, women still remain somewhat inferior to men, in the workplace and outside the workplace.  More college graduates are female than male, yet men hold higher paying positions on average.  This discrepancy is the result of years of gender discrimination, and it would be hard to deny that this discrimination is still an issue today.  Men are sometimes discriminated against as well, but not in the workplace.  They would face challenges when attempting to take on a traditionally female role, such as that of the homemaker or caretaker of children.  Both men and women face discrimination because the genders, even in modern America, are not viewed as equal and still tend to define roles and jobs.  This is a difficult problem to fix, and it will take a long time to overcome traditional views of gender inequality.  The best thing to do is keep an open mind about the roles of men and women and challenge others to do the same.\n",
        "To whom it may concern-\n\nI definitely believe that gender discrimination exists in society today. It is everywhere from school, to a child's playhouse, to even the workplace. I'm pretty sure that there is always going to be at least a little bit of gender discrimination in this world. It seems as though it has been incorporated into our culture since the beginnings of time. Since men are naturally more muscular than women, they will always be perceived to be the stronger and more dominant sex. Women, by their regular caring nature, will always be looked upon in that motherly sense. Physically, our bodies are made this way. Women can care for infants by providing nutrients through breastfeeding, while the men \"take care\" of the family with their muscles and toughness. I don't think that there is anything\nanyone can do to totally eliminate the discrimination of different genders, but it can definitely be changed to a more equal state. I believe that, since society influences gender by producing things relating specifically to girls or boys (generally), there is only one way to get rid of gender discrimination. This way is to raise someone in a world not affected by society's views on gender. This, of course, will basically be next to impossible- but if you want to throw your child on an empty island for the entirety of his/her life, it may be possible.\n\nThis gender discrimination influenced by society is obviously part of the workplace, since the workplace makes up a good amount of society. I used to be employed by a real estate company, and I was a receptionist/secretary. This is not your typical job for an 18 year old male. My friends would joke around with the idea saying that I had a girly job, which I knew was true. (but hey, it paid good...) This job is definitely a girly job, and I can totally see that. There are more masculine jobs such as construction workers. These stereotypes go back to the physical nature of men vs. women, and how they are perceived. Construction needs muscles, and secretaries need...multitasking abilities??? ha ha. The point is that gender discrimination is DEFINITELY in the workplace, and throughout the world. This is not always a bad thing though- Is it hurting anybody? In these cases no, but that's not to say that it doesn't happen. This type of discrimination is part of human nature- something that we can not help.\n\nThanks for listening!\n\n-ID#: 20\n\n",

        "To whom it may concern-\n\nI believe that gay \"marriages\" should not exist at all in the U.S. (or anywhere in general). With the occasional events where I am grossed out, I have no problem with gay men or women. I am a Roman Catholic, so it is technically against my religion to allow gay marriages. A marriage was created for a man and a woman to be united. Why doesn't the government create a different word for the union of two men or women? The \"union\" would not be valid within the Church, but there is no stopping the Church's opinion since the religion won't (and shouldn't) change. I feel that President Bush's \"push for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage\" is half good and half bad. The United States WAS created based on Christian principles whether people today like it or not. For this reason, President Bush is correct in following in our forefathers footsteps. Bush is wrong, however, for interfering with American's beliefs and lifestyles. In a way, it seems as though the government, based upon this legal action, is STARTING be become a totalitarian government, or whatever that is called. If the government could create an official \"union\" between two men or women, then I think that that plan would be sufficient to meet everyones needs. A marriage would remain sacred within the Church, and gay couples could legally be together. This plan would hopefully make everyone happy and get rid of all the controversy within our country on this topic today.\n\nThanks for your time....again.\n\nID # 20\n\n",

        "I do feel as though gender discrimination is still very much a part of our scociety today.  Men still have the inner path to success weather our coorporations want to admit it or not.  The sporting world also sees a great deal of gender descrimination.  Women sports do not get as much regognition national or globaly.  Women athletes only make a small percentage of what men athletes make and in individual sports such as tennis or golf the winners of the LPGA and womens tennis events often take home much smaller winnings than that or their male counterparts.  Women have been given a disadavantage in the working world that stems back for centuries, however, now more than ever the tides of change have been rolling in.  It is my belief that within the next 20 years women will share in equall oppertunities that men do within coorprate america. \n     As for reverse gender descrimination, I feel as though it is only present in certain professions such as nursing.  As many movies like to portray, nursing used to be a female dominated profession.  It still is a female heavy job but it does employ many men now.\n",
        "How often do you see people challenging their gender roles?  Not often. \nPeople then ask innocently if gender discrimination exists today.  Of\ncourse it does!  It's all around us, and unfortunatly it goes both ways,\nboth women and men are discriminated against.  Many men who stay home with\ntheir children are seen as lesser because they are not the breadwinner for\ntheir family. This brings up another question, who says the man must be\nthe main earner for any family?  It is a socially mandated concept, and\nthese things can evolve and change.  Conversely a woman who has\nconcentrated on her career is often seen as cold and unloving as well as\ntoo driven.  A man who did the same thing would be commended for his\nambition.  The way things have been seperated in our society by gender is\nridiculous.  Why are these distinctions even present?  Men and women are\ndifferent yes, but with very few exceptions men and women can do the same\nthings.\nI am not saying that all of the restriction should be eased or even\nlifted.  For some it is necessary to be strict.  Tests for jobs such as\nthe police force or the firefighters should be the same for both genders. \nThis may mean there will be less of one gender but those who are there can\nactually do the job and do it well.\nGender discrimination is the same thing as any other sort of\ndiscrimination.

        "Yes, I feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States.  While advancements have been made towards closing this gap, there still exists many places where we have not been doing too well.  While people are taught in elementary school that both boys and girls are equal and we should always be respectful, many children learn from observation. \nTheir father goes to the office everyday while their mother may either stay at home or hold some sort of part time job.  This teaches them, by observation, that men are the workers and women are the ones who take care of the family.\nIn order to make some kind of change, we have to continue on the same path that we have been.  That is, more and more women need to pull themselves out into the workplace and prove that they can do it too and defy aged boundries.  Also, both men and women need to learn to accept the change as a good thing rather than as a battle.  This only increases tension and increases the discrimination.\n",
        "   While I do feel that war should only be utilized if all other methods fail, I also feel that it is a necessary part of the world.  The war in Iraq was fought for a purpose - to remove Saddam Hussein from power.  It was quite apparent to everyone that Saddam was not a friend of the free world.  To me, it does not matter if we went to war over weapons of mass destruction that weren't there.  The U.S. saw a threat and dealt with it.  And now the world is a safer place because of it.\n    I cannot stand when people use hindsight to justify their arguments.  People who oppose the war in Iraq say that the president was lying to the American people about the WMD's.  In the business of intelligence gathering, not all intelligence is accurate.  Based on the intelligence the U.S. had at the time, we decided the probability of Saddam possessing WMD's was too high  not to take action. \n    I realize that war is costly in terms of soldiers' lives and money.

        "    I feel that the legalization of marijuana is a good idea for many reasons. First, as opposed to alcohol, marijuana has no negative side effects. Second, there are no proven health risks to marijuana. Alcohol, on the other hand, has tons of negative side effects, both long-term and immediate. Third, if marijuana were legal, there would be much less crime. In Amsterdam, where marijuana is legal to a certain extent, crime is almost nonexistent. Fourth, if marijuana were legal, its price would certainly drop, and Americans would not have to waste so much money buying it. Whether you drink or you smoke marijuana, both will make you intoxicated in some way. However, alcohol brings with it many negative side effects and health risks. As long as alcohol is legal, marijuana should be legal as well.\n",
        "First, the shooter was dumb to post a myspace bulletin. I don't understand why people have these stupid personal pages and leave their lifes history for any random person to read about! THe kid must have wanted to get caught if he/she was silly enough to post a bulletin leading authorities to assume that he was going to bring a gun to school. I do not think this was an invasion of privacy by any means. Everything on the internet is open to the public. People post personal things to be read-they cannot pick and choose who they want to read it or not. At my high school, our principle had an account..it was well known..the administration would occasionally check up on what was going on in the school. I had no problem with it..if you feel like you have to hide something, then maybe you should not be doing it! Where to draw the line? Well, if it is for our safety and well being, then I don't think there needs to be a line. If kids express themselves through the internet rather then getting help, then authorities should have the rights to see these things. Sometimes people express themself better through writing-a troubled person could just be waiting for someone to hear them and help.I have nothing to hide that I post. If you want to hide something..do I have nothing to hide that I post. If you want to hide something..do not post it online. This will help with the whole drawing the line issue.

        "Considering that the effects of alcohol are potentially much more fatal than those of marijuana, it is not really doing any harm for the government to legalize it. People die from alcohol poisening all the time, but you've never heard of someone overdosing from smoking too much pot. In legalizing marijuana, the government will actually be able to have more control over it and prevent such things as users unknowingly buying the drug laced with other, more dangerous substances. It may also help to reduce drug related violence because there would be no conflicts over being on someone elses turf. Also, law enforcement could focus on more serious crimes, rather than arresting people for possessing a drug that is less lethal than alcohol. Not only is marijuana less lethal the alcohol, it is less lethal than many perscription drugs. At this point, it is doing more harm to make marijuana illegal than it is to legalize it and people will smoke it regardless, so the goverment might as well get control over it.\n",

They have already modified\nthe fasting laws and the age that people are allowed to fast. I think that\nthere is no reason why women should not be able to further themselves by\nbecoming priests. They even had women priests in Jesus' day. Women are\nequal to men in this society and if the Church refuses to recognize that\nthen I think they are up against a very large community of angry women. I\nalso understand that priest take an oath to be faithful and married to\nGod, however, I do not understand why God would not want them to\nexperience the joys of married and family life and for them to share God\nwith their families. I think it would only benefit the Catholic communtiy\nseeing the priest with his family and how they act. It would be a good\nmodel for the community.

        "I definitely think that gender discrimination is an issue in present-day United States.  There are certainly obvious differences between men and women.  I think that although women have come a long way in terms of being less discriminated against than in the past, they stil face much discrimination.  The roles that have typically been associated with women in the past has lead to stereotypes which still exist today.  I think that the root of this gender discrimination comes from stereotypes.  Until these stereotypes are completely eliminated (which I don't really think will ever happen), I'm not really sure what can be done to change this.  My best guess would be to say for everyone just to try to keep as open a mind as possible and never to assume that a man or a woman could do a certain task better.  As women keep proving that in most cases they are just as qualified to do a certain task as a man is, then maybe over time, the stereotypes will start to lessen and, possibly eventually, go away. One of the main places in which I feel that gender discrimination occurs is in the workplace.  Studies have shown that often in situations where men and women are performing the exact same job, the man makes a higher salary.  I find this completely unfair.  If two people are performing exactly the same job duties, there should be no difference in their salary based simply on gender.  There is also the situation that we hear about of the \"glass ceiling\".  This is where women and look up and see the men above them, but they can't actually get to that point themselves.  While there are certainly women in high positions in business and management, most of the TOP officers are men.  Again, I am not saying that this is ALWAYS the case, but this situation does occur quite frequently.  The way I see it, there is no real reason for this other than gender discrimination.  I believe that women could do equally as well a job as men.  Howwomenever, this bring up another issue.  If women were to hold these top positions, then they would inevitably be \"bosses\" to both men and women alike.  Since stereotypes and discrimination do exist though, the woman could be less effective at her job, since some of the men might not respect her or follow her orders as much as they would if a man was their boss.  An example that I have of this is from my friend.  Her dad works in an office where his boss is a woman.  He is extremely resentful of this fact, and I have heard him make comments about her several times while I have been at the house.  Now I am sure that she can perform the regular job duties equally as well as a man in her position, but here is a situation where one of her employees does not hold the same respect for her as she deserves. I also think that women are discriminated against in situations where physical strenght is required.  Yes, it is a fact that women are built differently than men.  Most men tend to be bigger and stronger than women. But again, this is not always the case.  Personally, I know that I am rather weak in comparision with males my age, but I know girls who are stronger than some of the guys.  So if there is a woman who possesses great physical strength and would like to do a job that requires physical strength (ex: military, firefighter, police officer, etc.) then I believe\nthat they should be allowed to. I don't really think that men face the same sort of discrimination as women do.  The only type of discrimination that I can think of off the top of my head that males face would be that they would be \"tougher\" than women.  Generally, personality-wise, the stereotype is that men are \"tough\" and women are more emotional.\n",
        "To whom it may concern-\n\nI believe that the war in Iraq was, and is a good idea. It is true that there has been a LOT of money spent over there, but everyone should look out for one another as human beings. I think that a lot of people do not support the war just because they don't like George W. Bush. I support his efforts in the Mid-East mainly because he is the leader of the greatest nation on Earth. If I start a project, I don't get up and leave half way through. A lot of Americans think that this is what Bush should do with the war. I like the fact that he is sticking to what he wants to do. What people need to realize is that he knows things that we are never allowed to set eyes on. We don't know what the \"real story\" is behind the curtain so to speak. I'm sure that if we knew everything that all the other world leaders have done throughout the world, we would be supporting Bush all the way.\n\nA true leader knows when to stick with his/her ways, even if his people don't like what he/she is doing. Yes, I feel bad for all of the soldiers over there, but I also support them being there. They all knew what they were signing up for when they enlisted, so they should not be complaining (as harsh as that sounds). The civilians who are complaining about the war make it seem as though we (the United States) don't even support our troops as they say that the war is pointless. This really makes me mad, because it's people like that who are disrespecting our armed forces and all of their good deeds. If this was right after September 11th, EVERYONE would be \"gung ho\" about the Iraq war, but since everyone's blood is not flowing as much anymore, their dedication has dropped. I think that true Americans should support their armed forces and leader even through rough times. If the country is in a rough patch because of a mistake, we still need to support everything our leader does. Is he not human also? People who expect our president to be perfect are juvenile. They are too simple minded to see the big picture. Americans need to realize that they DON'T know all of what is going on, they need to support our troops by POSITIVE TALK, and most of all, they need to support our leader, the good ol' George W.\n\nI sound way too conservative in this, haha,\n\nID#: 20\n",
        "I have a problem with the legalization of marijuana both in theory and in practicality.  In theory, people argue that marijuana has similar effects to alcohol so if alcohol is legal, marijuana should be too.  In reality, marijuana's effects are NOT the same as alcohol's.  Marijuana is an unclassified drug: it has characteristics of a halluicogen and narcotic, among others.  Alcohol is simply a depressant - it slows down the body's nervous system and thought processes.  Marijuana, on the other hand, has different effects on different people, and affects many different parts of the brain.  It does not simply slow reaction time, but works in many different ways to change a person's perception.\n\nPeople also argue that cigarettes, which contain the harmful and addictive drug nicotene, are legal, so why not joints?  I say not only should smoking joints remain illegal, but eventually cigarettes should me made illegal as well.  Nobody wants to get cancer from other sources, like radiation, so they make the government heavily control them.  In the meantime, smokers are diagnosed with and die of lung cancer every day.  Alcohol causes health problems of its own, but at least an alcoholic can't give one of his family members secondhand alcohol poisoning or liver disease.  Smoking in general is a public health risk, and I don't see why we should add to that with a substance as questionable as marijuana.\n\nEven if the idea sounded good in theory, in practicality it would never fly.  Police already have a hard enough time regulating dug traffiking in major cities like Denver - now we're going to add on the additional element that suddenly everyone over 21 has become a potential dealer.  The rate of sales of drugs to minors will skyrocket as it becomes easier and easier for them to get their hands on it, and kids will start smoking and getting addicted to pot younger and younger.  Rates of high school graduation will probably decline significantly.  I say we should make it as hard as possible for kids to get their hands on substances which are illegal for them... whether alcohol or marijuana.\n\nPlus, who is going to regulate whether or not the \"allotted amount\" of pot is used wisely?  It's going to make the jobs of police that much harder to pull over every drunk or high driver on the highways, and new regulations and laws will have to be set into place to determine the legal blood content of marijuana.  Plus, how would amounts be regulated?  And what is to stop a man from buying his allowance of pot in one store, and then going next door and getting more so he can sell it?  Leagalizing marijuana opens a Pandora's box of problems that the legislative and judicial systems just don't have the resources to fix right now.  It will just end up a big headache and the right will be revoked in a few years.  Legalizing marijuana is just giving young people one more way to get into trouble, and the government one more hassle.\n\n",
        "   I do believe that the catholic chruch needs to update its criteria a\nlittle bit. Being an avod catholic myself, I do not think that it is\nright to not allow priests to marry. This is actually cutting\ndrastically into our religion, because more and more people who are\nordaned are also wanting to become priests, but find themselves being\ndicons instead, and thus can not preform all of the sacraments.\n  In jeasuses time, priests were allowed to be married and there are no\nrules in the Bible that prevent such men from entering into a\nrelationship with a woman, getting married and having a family. This is\na man made law. It dates back to the time when the roman catholic church\nwas corrupt and the popes...yes there were sometimes more then\none...would act only in their own intersests and ignor the rightful\nteachings of God.\n   However, we have come a long way from this point in our lives, and have\ndemonstrated that we can all now act as one and follow the teachings of\nGod. It is thus time to allow priest so enter into marraige and be able\nto have a family. It would actually be good for them to have families\ntoo, because if they truly are rasining them in the eyes of the Lord,\nthen they are setting a good example for others to follow and model\nafter as.\n   I believe that if priest were allowed to marry there would probably\nalso have been a decrease in the indecencey of gay relationships or\nchild mulestation. Men are known to have needs that they try and\nfulfill. Unfortunatly by denying them the right to enter into marraige,\nthey are finding other outlets to \"relieve\" themselves. THis is\ncompleatly and utterly gastly and harmful, not only to the individuals\ninvolved, but to those around them who know these people in person and\nto the church itself.\n  It is my thought that the church handled this entire situation\nexceedinly poorly because they were in a way just too shocked to really\nfully grasp the entire situation and know what was going on. instead\nthey felt that covering up the harmulf deed or removing one of the\nindividuals to another locations..ofthen the priest, would solve the\nproblem. It didn't of course, because the needs of that priest were\nstill there, so instead he just succeeded in hurting more people around\nhim instead of teaching others in the way of the Lord.\n   THis is why priest should be able to marry and this is why the curch\nneeds to recognize the problems they are faced with.\n   women should also be able to become priests, because who is to say that\nonly men are able to teach others ih the way of the lord? I certainly\nknow plenty of women who love to talk about God and know more then many\npriests or know just as much as priest now adays. Perhaps if women\ncould be priest, this would also help eliminate the shortage of\npriests, and maybe even attract others to listen to the word, knowing\nthat it treates both sexes equally, just as the Bible tells us to do.\n\n",
        "I attended a Loyola Alive meeting two weeks ago that facilitated a discussion about the movie \"The Cider House Rules\" and the topic of abortion.  The movie takes place during the 1940's, a time when abortion was illegal.  It became obvious that one of the points that the film-maker was trying to make had to do with the rules women were forced to obey, rules that were made by men who knew nothing about abortion.  The leader of the discussion asked us this question: \"What is so unique about the new Speaker of the House?\"  And the answer is of course, that Nancy Pelosi is the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives in the history of the United States.  And men still greatly outnumber women in both the House and the Senate.  There has never been a female President, or Vice President, or Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  Condaleezza Rice is only the 2nd female Secretary of State.\n\nIf the U.S. government, the most important and the most prominent institution in this country, is still dominated by men, then yes, gender discrimination against women is a very real problem that exists in our society.\n\nIn several career fields, such as engineering and the military, men also dominate.  My dad is an engineer, and he always comments about the lack of women in powerful positions.  He used to tell me it was a good thing that I didn't want to be an engineer, because it was very difficult for women to gain respect in the field.  Obviously the military is mostly made up of men.  Indeed there are many people who feel that women should never have been allowed to join the military at all, and many more who believe that women should never be part of a draft (if another one were to occur).\n\nEven in such a high-profile industry as the the sports business, women are discriminated against.  For example, female tennis players receive less prize money than male tennis players for the same Grand Slam tournaments.\n\nGender discrimination is not specific to women however.  Men experience it too.  Though they are more likely to encounter it in the educational system.  Studies have shown that the two sexes learn in different ways and respond better to different teaching methods.  Studies have also shown that teachers tend to cater to the learning needs of young girls and encourage them more than young boys.  Because it was the girls who were for so long at a disadvantage in the classroom, today teachers tend to (usually unconsciously) overcompensate.  It's not that they deliberately neglect the boys, but that they are trying so hard educate the girls well, and NOT ignore them.  Indeed the numbers of boys going on to higher education is dwindling. Here at Loyola College the student population is at least 60% female, and this is common in colleges throughout the country.  Boys have special education needs and they are not being met.\n\nSchool administrations need to keep a closer eye on their teachers and the classroom environment that they create.  They should educate teachers about the various methods of teaching.\n\nIn order to fight gender discrimination against women in the workplace, the government must enforce stricter regulation of hiring practices and harsher punishments.\n\nThe most important thing in the fight against gender discrimination is the recognition that it is still a very real issue in today's society.\n",
        "Gay marriage is a tough topic.  I am still not really sure where I stand on this issue.  It does seem to me that marriage is an instituion that is designed for a man and a woman.  I have gone to Catholic school my entire life and it was pretty well engrained that homosexuality was something \"bad\".  I believe that the Church's official position on homosexuality is that while it is not wrong to have homosexual feelings, it is wrong to act on them.  In this regard, it would make sense that gay marriage should not be allowed.  However, I can not just go strictly by this point of view because as I have gotten older and have been able to think more for myself instead of just accepting what I am told, my views on homosexuality have broaded.  I am much more accepting now.  I have a couple of friends who are gay and I don't feel that I treat them any differently than any of my heterosexual friends.  However, being accepting of homosexuality and supporting gay marriage are  I think that whatever the decision, not exactly the same.  I am pretty  I think that whatever the decision, divided on this issue.  On the one hand, if a gay couple is in love and really wants to get married, who are we to tell them that they are not allowed to get married.  Maybe they want to adopt a child or start a family.  It would make sense then that they should be bound together by marriage and by law.  Also, marriage can often make things easier financially, such as when filing for taxes.  Why should we deny h I think that whatever the decision, omosexuals these benefits of marriage?  On the other hand, I most often think of marriage as a sacred bond between a man and a woman.  I still struggle to get past this idea. Regardless of what the decision is, I think that it is strange that is is legal in some states but not in others.  We are the UNITED states of America, and so it seems logical to me that we should be united on such major issues as gay marriage.   I'm not really sure how I feel about President Bush's push for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. It seems that right now, the situation is probably a happy medium because if a gay couple REALLY wants to get married, they can at least go to certain states.  However, the people who are really against gay marriage can be somewhat satisfied because at least gay marriage is not legal everywhere.  This is one of those issues where it is really hard to come up with a right or a wrong answer.\n\n",
        "I am one hundered percent for gay marraige. I think when two people want to get married, no matter who the two people are they should be allowed to do so. I think it is wrong to say that they cant. Who is President Bush to say that there are some people in the United States that are not allowed to be together? The federal government should not have any more of a say in this type of marriage that they do in any other.\n",
        "There is no such thing as an unlawful invasion of privacy becuase Americans are nowhere guaranteed the right to privacy.  If the American government suspects potential harm, it has the power to invade the privacy of American citizens in the interest of doing what is best for the nation and the American people as a whole.  National security can only be acheived through invading privacy because subversive acts are naturally kept private.  No one would advertise their involvement in a harmful or malicious act, because of the consequences that could result. In order to uncover these acts before they happen, therefore, it is necessary to invade privacy and investigate suspicious activity.  If the government has reason to believe that someone is hiding something which could be dangerous to the US or to other people, the government has a duty to protect its citizens by investigating the hidden activity.  Of course, no government is justified in invading privacy without cause, but wherever suspicious activity is present or believed to exist, it is absolutely acceptable for the government to intervene, invading privacy if necessary to uphold safety and security. In the case of preventing a school shooting through an invasion of privacy, lives were saved and the invasion of privacy was completely justified because its aim was to maintain American security.\n",
        "Dear CMC Study,\n\nAs with any institution that's been around for millenia (okay, granted, that's the only one I can think of offhand), the Catholic Church is essentially a conservative body which resists any change. This can be seen as a blessing and a curse, but lately it's mostly been a curse. The concerns that the Church served through its current structure died out over a hundred years ago, and relatively little has been done to make that structure relevant since. In order for it to stay alive through the 21st century, I think some major changes are needed. \nI think allowing priests to marry and ordaining female priests would be a step in the right direction, if not the end in itself. The Church is set up like a self-monitering fraternity right now, and as we've seen that hasn't worked out too well (and hasn't prove nearly as funny as, say, \"Animal House\").\n\nQuick Handy-dandy Guide to becoming a married Catholic Priest:\n1. Get married.\n2. Attend an Anglican or Episcopalian seminary and become ordained into\none of those sects.\n3. Several months later, experience a \"conversion\" and decide you want to become a Catholic.\n4. Because of the preponderance of doctrinal similarities between the sects, the Catholic Church will accept you, marriage and all, as a full-fledged priest in the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nI just thought I'd throw that in.\n\nPeace,\n#6\n",
        "To whom it may concern:\n\nI feel as though the school officials were not invading privacy at all. The entire point of a myspace bulletin is for people- the public- to see. Why anyone would post something as horrible as a potential school shooting on myspace is beyond me, and even more so if the person does not expect to be caught. The school was doing its job by looking out for all of its students. If anyone within the school system is in danger, someone needs to do something to fix it. The school needs to make sure that its environment is a 100% save place for kids to be. Did the school harm the person who was going to do the shooting? No. The school used myspace- since it IS available to the public- to TURN OVER the potential shooter. I don't see anything wrong with the school turning over a student who was willing to kill others. Where should we draw the line for privacy though? I'd say that the school should not go on the internet to  only get kids in trouble. If there are lives in danger, then the school/police should be able to use things such as myspace to get kids in trouble. However, if the school is only looking for pictures of kids drinking, etc., then I think that that is an invasion of privacy. What the school did was good, but if they did the same thing for other reasons (to catch kids drinking, etc.), then THAT would be \"taking it over the edge\" as an invasion of privacy.\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nID # 20\n\n",
        "The war in Iraq has gone on long enough.  No one knows exactly what the US is meant to be doing by occupying Iraq.  The goals of our presence there are unclear to the American public, making it hard as a citizen to support the continuance of the war.  It is easy to see only the negative aspects of war, such as lost lives, the fragmentation of families, the distraction from domestic affairs, and the way in which the war has become the focus of American foreign policy.  With no clear goal in mind, it is difficult to distinguish anything positive that could result from American occupation of Iraq.  The negative effects of the war are already taking a toll on American society, and the longer we continue to stay in Iraq, the worse these effects will become.  More families will be torn apart, more soldiers will die, and more pressing issues will arise and be neglected due to the focus on the war in Iraq.  There is really no purpose to the continued occupation of Iraq.  Americans should realize that their country in doing no good to the Iraqi people by having troops there.  The citizens of Iraq as well as the American population, would fare better if the American government left the war in Iraq and returned to its fulfilling its many other roles.\n",
        "To an extent, I believe the city of Denver is justified in its actions.  The legalization of marijuana, while not necessarily a positive for humans, is not the worst of negatives pertaining to human health.  Marijuana is not that far off from other drugs such as alochol and cigarettes in its effects.  When taken in moderation it is certainly equal to, if not less, harmful to humans than cigarettes.  Typically cigarette users smoke multiple cigarettes daily and this amount of intake of the various chemicals and carcinogens is far more dangerous than the occassional use of marijuana.  Marijuana is typically used less, most likely due to its more powerful effects in terms of pleasure as well as cost per unit.  The type of health effects from marijuana are also not that far off from those of alcohol, both in the short and long term.  The large difference between cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana is that society is used to marijuana being illegal and the other two not.  It does not seem right for it to be legalized because it is a change which does not come easy to humans.\n\nMarijuana, just like the other two, has a level of moderation that causes very little effects to the human health.  Certainly if a person has several packs of cigarettes every day or even every week they are bound to have harmful health conditions.  The same applies to alcohol:  if a person increases their blood alcohol content excessively high, there will be definite short term illness and/or impairments as well as those long term if this type of action was periodic.  Marijuana is no differnt, there is a level of moderation where it can be considered to have little harm to humans.  Hopefully this is part of the reason the city of Denver legalized the sale of marijuana in small amounts, and hopefully there is also a way to regulate the amount of purchases for any one person.\n\nFinally, the sale of marijuana in small amounts can also be good for the economy and the city from a social aspect.  The economy will get a boost because the majority of the black market sales of marijuana will become legal and thus taxable so the city and state can make additional income.  Also the illegal black market transactions will reduce the amount of violence to some degree because there will not necessarily have to be dangerous transactions in order to acquire the substance.\n",
        "This is a topic in which i have very strong opinions about.  I am completely 100% in favor of gay marriage, so much infact that i think it should be a federal law and that law should be marriage is betteen two people not a man and a women.  In high school i was a member of SAGABA my high schools streight gay and bisexual allience.  I met numbers of openly gay students at my school that on a daily basis faced hatred that i knew nothing about.  Many of them lived their daily lives affraid of who they are becaue they were going to a non excepting school that in many cases had predjudice teachers taking out their hatred on them as well.  These kids graduated from my high school and moved on to bigger, better, and more accepting things.  They had spend 7 years in the Strath Haven bubble facing name calling, physical abuse, and worst of all fear of who they really were.  Some of them have now gone on to find love and now why shouldnt they be able to express it with marriage the same way any other loving couple in our country does.  It should be federal law to allow gay marriage, and as soon as our racist, homophobic moron of a president is out of office (and that day can not come soon enough) i feel the next president ellected(a democrat god willing) will  allow for our entire countries population to find love and happiness.\n",
        "I am in favor of the legalization of gay marriage, and I support states like Massachusetts that have passed laws to allow it.  Vermont and New Jersey, allow civil unions between two gay people, but refrain from giving it the title of \"marriage.\"  These states are taking the important steps in the fight against discrimination and the fight for equality among all different groups of people.\n\nThis is not the first time that the government has restricted the rights of its citizens to marry.  Before the Civil War, American citizens could not marry slaves.  But even after the Civil War, there were several state laws that banned marriage between white people and African Americans.  Some of these contiued into the late 20th century.  When my aunt married a black man in the early 1980's, it took a long time before all the members of my family actually accepted the marriage and welcomed her husband into the family.  I can't help but see in the opposition to gay marriage yet another form of discrimination manifesting itself in the American public.\n\nThere should not be an amendment to the Constitution that bans gay marriage.   I think that the President has much more important things to worry about, like National Security and the war that he started in Iraq.  I think questions of marriage should be left up to the states.\n",
        "Well first off, let me start off by saying I don't really care at all what\nthe Catholic Church decides to do.  I've already decided for myself that\nreligion is not something I'm interested in being a part of, and would\nrather not hear anything about religion for the rest of my life.  That\nbeing said, my responses can be put into the context of a nonbeliever.\n\nShould the Catholic Church have to change it's ways to adapt to 21st\ncentury life? I don't personally know if they need to.  What I mean is, Is\nthe Church's popularity waning? I'm not really up to date on the numbers\nbut it seems as if they are still holding strong in Europe and growing\nexponentially in Africa and Latin America.  In the U.S., it's hard for me\nto say, especially since I go to a Catholic school, where there are\nCatholics everywhere.  If they really are in need of some kind of change,\nwe have to look at the process of change since its conception.  I mean,\nthink how many thousands of years it took just to allow laypeople to read\nthe people.  I'm pretty sure that took over a millenium.  And to allow\ntranslations of the bible, and to accept versions of the Bible as valid\nbesides for their precious Vulgate?  Also took thousands and thousands of\nyears.  However, the main difference between that millenium and this one\nis that people live outside of religion.  What I mean by that is that\nuntil the modern era, God was a generally accepted truth.  Nobody didn't\nbelieve.  Today we have barriers set up between believers and the rest of\nthe world.  It's much easier to attract people to your religion when\neverybody already believes.  So do I think the Church needs to change?\nAbsolutely.  The church is still operating under the idea that the way\nthey worked during the middle ages, the way they worked during the\nrenaissance, still works.  And it doesn't.\n\nUnfortunately, my advice to the Catholic Church is a little too radical\nfor Catholics to accept.  My first piece of advice: Forget the pope. \nReally.  Why is there a pope?  Someone thats holier than all of us? \nSomeone thats between us and God?  Why do you listen to what he says,\nholding on to his words so closely?  He wasn't chosen by God, he was\nchosen by men.  That should probably tell you something right away.  Stop\nmaking people think they need a pope to be in contact with God, cuz it's a\nlie.\n\nThat's really all the advice I have to give to the Catholic Church.  I\nreally don't care what else they do.  I'm just tired of the pope.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "I feel fine about Denver legalizing marijuana.  All the evidence I have seen points to a simple fact - when used in moderation and in an appropriate setting, marijuana does not hurt anyone.  Actually, the people who use it seem to have a blast!  Alcohol, which is legal for people over 21, causes people to get \"sloppy drunk\" and angry, resulting in bar fights and other idiotic displays of immaturity. People who get stoned just watch\nTV -  I don't even think they would have the energy to get in a fight. Most importantly, you can die of alcohol poisoning. Its physically impossible to overdose on marijuana - the amount you would need to consume is so large that the person would simply pass out before they could even get halfway.  Knowing all this, it seems pretty obvious that alcohol has worse effects than marijuana.  Since alcohol is legal, shouldn't marijuana be as well?\n\n",
        "\nI believe the catholic church has lost there way, No longer is church\nabout serving the poor and helping those who need spiritual guidance, its\nbasically a way for people to point out whose wrong and whose right. Now\ngranted this is the way I see it as the Catholic Church as the whole but\nupon interacting with a few Jesuit priests here at Loyola this notion is\nsteadily changing. Actually these priests at Loyola I belive are the new\nwave of priests who are adapting Catholism to college students in a way\nthat they will understand. Because I know personally I struggle with\nunderstanding the Bible, and the priests here put the Bible in general\nterms that can be adapted to college life. I believe that even Catholism\nis finding it hard to live strictly according to the Bible so why not\nchange it according today's lifestyle. Or even make more general statments\ninstead of being so specific. I feel like God will be ok with the fact\nthat we are praying and understanding the Bible. I believe that Bible\nwasnt meant for us to understand every little thing but so that we could\nbe able to relate to it and find God in it. How can we do that if we are\nconstantly worrying about the little things?\n\nI dont think the Catholic Church should change anything marriage wise for\nthe priests because it sets the Catholic Church apart from all the other\nreligions. But what I do question is are the people that commit these\ncrimes really meant to become priests? Are they mistaken in their calling?\nI believe that God provides for every and anything we need, so if these\npriests are commiting these crimes maybe God is showing them that they\nneed to chose a different profession. Granted  arousal is a very strong\nurge that humans can get, however if they were really meant to be priests\nwouldn't God suffice for this urge?\n\n",
        "I think gender discrimination absolutely still exists in our country, but not at the same level of intensity that it once was. There are many men today who still feel that women belong \"in the kitchen.\" Many times it is said in a joking way, but there is still some sense of truth to it in their minds. In the workplace, men often feel that women are not good enough, and are not able to accomplish the same things that they are. Women are looked at as sexual beings and not much more. However, many men have seen discrimination too. The idea of \"Mr.Mom\", a stay at home dad with a woman as the main source of income is not at all uncommon, but still men who choose this as their profession are ridiculed.\n\n",
        "The Catholic Church, as usual, is behind the times in terms of fully\napplying itself in the dynamic, globalized world.  I don't really pay much\nattention to it, and thought the media circus surrounding the priest\nallegations was really just the hyenas on CBS and NBC and FOX having a\nfield day and banking tons of cash on advertising space.\n\nIt just illustrates that the antiquated doctrine of having celebate,\nstrictly male, priests isn't going to work for very long.  These people\nare turning into gay pedophiles, or if they aren't turning into gay\npedophiles, they are making it all the way through the seminary, and onto\npulpits with tendencies of gay pedophelia.\n\nThrough the ages, I don't think the Catholic church has really been a\nconstructive force at many different periods in time.  Look at the reasons\nwhy martin luther was so disgusted with it, the cronyism and peddling of\nrelics merely reduced the entire church into a sort of religious \"pyramid\nscheme\" which really only benefitted the clergy.  Clergy take vows of\npoverty, but constitute some of the most greedy people I have ever met in\nmy life.  Sure church teachings on social justice are noble, but they are\nso often held way too fervently that they true messages of love are\nskewed, and take on attributes of hatred and condemnation,\n",
        "First things first. President Bush is completely stepping over the line\nwhen he pushes for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.  His\nreasoning is at its base a religious reasoning.  Of all people the\npresident of the United States should not allow his faith to cloud his\njudgement, and yet that is exactly what he is doing.  There should be a\nseperation between the church and the government.  First of all,not all\ncitizens of the United States agree with his religious point of view.  How\ncan we base a law which will affect those very people to their core on one\nman's opinion?  I can see the point that some make that \"marriage\" is\nbetween a man and a woman.  Ok sure, but then leave the word marriage in a\nchurch and allow everyone to have a civil union.  This way everyone would\nbe able to recive benefits from their life partner whether they be\nheterosexual or homosexual.  Some of these same people however argue\nagainst even a civil union between same sex couples because these same sex\ncouples cannot have children.  Okay, if we're going to use that argument\nthen we cannot allow those couples who cannot have children or plan on not\nhaving children to have a marriage or a civil union either.  Whatever law\nis made it needs to apply to all people not just marginalize one group. \nTo me the law against civil unions against homosexual couples reminds of\nthe Jim Crow laws against blacks in the early part of their freedom.  How\nis this any different?  It is discrimination against a group of people\nsimply because of who they are.  They cannot change who they are and they\nshould not have to.  They should be accepted into our culture as part of\nit.  Which in fact they are.\n\n",
        "I think both sides are wrong.  While legalizing it is what I WOULD support, I also am very supportive of separation of church and state.  The government should have no say in a matter like this.  Though being married does create paperwork for things such as taxes, just because the partner is someone of the same sex does not mean that this will become a problem.  I think that it is up to the church to decide matters like this, that way people will always have an option if they want it and always be able to avoid it if they don't.  I am wholely against President Bush's THOUGHT about implementing an amendment of the sort.  Amendment's are supposed to tell us what the government can and cannot do, not tell us what WE can and cannot do.  That's for state law.  In all honesty I feel that President Bush has absolutely no clue about how the government is supposed to work and likes to cross lines that have been in place for scores and centuries.\n",
        "Well, the war certainly is a big issue. As of now, I have no family over in Iraq, nor any close to me. I feel safer knowing that our troops are over in Iraq, honestly, I do not know if they are making a difference, but my biggest fear would be, battles here on the U.S. When I speak to people who have visited Iraq, it freightens me..the thought that this could happen here. I would rather the fighting be over seas then on our land. I guess it is selfsih, but it is the truth. I have two brothers, both eligible if there were to be a draft. Now, if that ever happened I would strongly oppose our troops in Iraq. I would never be able to live with the thought of my brothers fighting over there. I would be happier knowing that they are ok, here with me. As for the length of the war, just keep it away from our lands.

        "I am quite shocked about this actually.  I had no idea that something like this was even being considered.  I know that the issue of medicinal marijuana has often been discussed, and for that I see some sort of beneficial purpose and good intention.  When hospital patients are in extreme pain, as when they suffer from some sort of chronic illness, sometimes marijuana may be the only thing that relieves that pain.  However, I'm not sure if I can discern any good reason why recreational marijuana should be legal.\n\nMarijuana is very much like alcohol in the negative and often dangerous effects it has on people.  But marijuana does not have any redeeming positive effects.  You see, if alcohol is consumed in moderation, studies have shown that it can be beneficial for one's health (lowering blood pressure and things like that).  Marijuana actually poses a more dangerous health threat than alcohol, because smoking marijuana, like smoking anything, damages your lungs.\n\nThis topic raises many questions for me.  How much marijuana is legal?  How much can you have and still be able to drive?  I keep thinking of a commercial that I used to see all the time, about a teenage driver who hit his brother and killed him.  The point of the commercial was that the driver was NOT drunk; he was HIGH.  I also wonder about the production of marijuana.  Will the growth of marijuana still be regulated? How will people over 21 get the marijuana?\n\nI don't think that this is a good idea. And I don't see any other cities folllowing Denver's lead.\n\n",
        "The side that has banned gay marriage is wrong for many reasons.  Governments originally came to be to protect man and enforce a basic set of moral laws so that safety could florish.  The governments today, waging such issues as gay marriage, have long since over-stepped their bounds.  Marriage, no matter what, is characterized by love and if two human beings, regardless of gender, love each other then the marriage is one hundred percent justified.  The government should have a role in protecting its citizens but this is a case of impedance where the government is taking away that right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nIf the Church wishes to ban that marriage, so be it, their views are very much outdated as it is.  There is no reason that a society should ban a legal bond between two gay spouses because they have every right as human beings to pursue a life that they see fit.  Of all sectors of the government, the Federal government is the last one who should step in if the government should even be able to ban such a thing.  To say that an entire country of people, billions of people, can not legally be in love in this territory is completely close-minded and stands against all this country was founded on.  The United States has come to stand for a place where people can be themselves and live a life of freedom; and here is George Bush trying to take all of those promises of this great country away from the citizens.\n\nFurthermore, there has been scientific data showing that people with homosexual tendencies are born with those tendencies.  To try and govern something so natural, something people are born with in their genetic coding, is unnatural and unjustified.  We do not ban people with disabilities from part of society just because they were born that way.  Each and every person in this country and on this planet is unique and was born with unique traits and characteristics.  A government filled with conservative, like-minded, and ignorant people should not have the ability to make something illegal when it is part of an individual's genetic make-up and personal choice.\n\n",
        "The Catholic Church is very outdated in its extremely conservative views,\nand it needs to realize that if it wants to maintain a following, it needs to implement some changes in its doctrine.  We live in a world where anything goes, where we are taught tolerance and acceptance of others who may be different from ourselves in various respects.  The Catholic Church teaches to \"love thy neighbor as thyself\" but shuns homosexuals and non-Catholics, taking a very hypocritical stance.  Anyone who agrees with these views would be deemed intolerant by today's society, and since we are brought up learning the value of tolerance, this could be quite insulting.  Modern Catholics are put in a very difficult situation of choosing between their religious doctrine and the standards of society.  In order to fit in better with today's society, the Catholic church needs to relax some of its stringent rules to become more accepting and more appealing to a modern audience.  The accusation of pedophilia were probably unavoidable, but changes in the Catholic Church would still be a very beneficial thing.\n",

I believe that Bush is trying the colonize\nIraq and make it a middle  east U.S. I believe that Bush figures its a\nwin-win situation, the Iraqis will have protection from anyone that tries\nto harm them and the U.S. will have control over their oil, which we so\ndesperately need. If Bush hasn't come up with a set plan on what he is\ngoing to do with Iraq he needs to give them back control of their country.\nWhich I believe is even more detrimental to the U.S. because we will\nprobably be leaving there country in shambles.

        "To whom it may concern:\n\nI think that the Catholic Church does not need to change its ways to adapt with the 21st century. What is the point in changing a religion to suit one's personal wants? I don't think that there is any logic in that. Everyone within the church most likely does not believe EVERYTHING that the Church stands for. I know many people who are religious, but support gay marriages, etc. Why can't people just be like them? I don't think that a religion would be where it is at if people kept changing it to suit how THEY WANTED to live. Religion guides the ways people should live...People should not guide the form of their religion. I personally am not the \"Jesus Freak,\" but I do go to church just about every Sunday. I don't know all about the Catholic religion, but I think that everything within it is there for a reason. The issue with women becoming priests makes me wonder a lot. \"Why shouldn't they become priests?\" people ask a lot. I say, \"why SHOULD they.\" The Catholic Church is known to be traditionally conservative, so why should they change that? It has always been that males could become priests and women could become nuns. A nun and a priest are basically on the same \"playing field\" in my opinion, so one is not better than the other. It's just like two different jobs within the same company with different specifications for their job descriptions. Each \"job\" is working towards the same general goal, but each title does different things.\n\nTo change the subject, I think that the charges against the Catholic Church are nonsense. That \"stuff\" goes on every day in other religions, organizations, etc. If the Church would change to fit the wants of the 21st century, it could be a good and bad thing. Yes it is true that, statistically speaking, the numbers of pedophilia would probably go down, but the attention would be taken off of the cases that occur anyways. All of the media's attention would go to the fact that the Church is changing. This would be bigger than if a priest did something gross with an juvenile. People just want what will get their attention most- they could probably care less about what a priest does in his spare time. So if the Church would change, everything that is on the news today (women not becoming priests, pedophilia, etc.) would not matter to anyone. Everyone would focus on this \"new change.\" People like to blame other people, it's in our nature- All in all, I would never consider changing the Catholic Church, because the accusations against it are not even as important to people as it may seem.\n\nVery long, but thanks for your time,\n\n-#20\n\n",
        "I do not think that marijuana should be legalized.  I don't really have a good reason why, but I just don't like the idea of the government legalizing a way for people to get high.  I think that it is particularly strange that just one city, Denver, has legalized marijuana.  This makes things even trickier.  For example, it just seems weird to me that you would be allowed to smoke in Denver, but not in the next town over.  It's not even that marijuana is legal in the state of Colorado, but only in one city.  That is just weird to me.   And how can we be sure that we are keeping this under control?  How can the government regulate whether or not the marijuana is really being brought to Denver.  Let's say there is some shipment or something that was coming from Mexico and was headed for Denver.  What's to say that the marijuana isn't going to be brought elsewhere?  Like how can you guarantee that it will wind up in Denver.  On the other hand, when everyone goes to Denver to legally purchase marijuana, there is no guarantee that they will smoke it in Denver and not just bring it back to wherever they came from (where it is illegal).  We already face this sort of an issue with fireworks.  They are allowed in some states, but not in others.  So people just go across the border and legally purchase fireworks.  It is so hard to regulate though, so people bring them back to states where it is not allowed.  We are talking about a similar situation here, but instead of talking about fireworks, we are discussing a drug which affects how a person acts and behaves.  Drunk driving is already a huge issue in our country. Sure, it is illegal to drive while intoxicated, but people do it all the time and lives are lost as a result.  Even though marijuana is not legal in the United States now, it doesn't mean that people don't smoke.  But why would we want to make it legal to purchase a drug which would just mean that more people could be on the roads under the influence.  I have never smoked myself, and so I am not sure exactly what the effects of marijuana are on a person but I would say that they are probably rather similar to the effects of alcohol.  So I would not want to have more people who are high driving around and going to work, etc.  It just doesn't seem right to me to make it legal to add another harmful drug to your body.\n\n\n",
        "Gender discrimination will always exist, because people will always reference what has happened in the past. Even when someone satirizes gender discrimination (provide an extreme example to highlight the flaws in that way of thinking), they are still prolonging its life by reminding people how to discriminate. Today, women and men are viewed much more equally in the workplace then the 50s, but I don't believe we have eradicated gender discrimination completely. Anyone can be subject to discrimination - everyone is different in their own way, and that can always be viewed in a negative light.\n",
        "I do feel as though gender discrimmination is still present in today's society. Although women have come a long ways in regards to equality and having the same opportunities as men, there is still that underlying sense of inferiority. I feel that gender discrimmination is more a problem in society's way of thinking because it shouldn't be a law that women be treated equally, it should just be that they are equal. Unless people change they this way of thinking all together, gender discrimmination will never go away. I find that when hanging out with my guy friends they will say jokes and comments in regards to women being inferior and although they just do it for a laugh, such jokes and comments show that there is still that underlying belief that has been present in society in regards to the status of women. Men should see women as equals because they want to not because they have to. I still feel as though if a man and a woman are going up for the same job position and are equally qualified, the man will get the job over the woman soley based on his gender. Also, women get less respect in the work place and we still see cases of sexual harrassment by co-workers. If men and women were really seen as equal, this problem would not still exist. Also, women who hold high positions in jobs are not always given the respect they deserve or the respect a man in the same position would get. During my senior year in high school and the summer before I left for college i worked as a nhas since its creation, and considering how far society as a whole has come,ight time receptionist and the daytime receptionist was a man. I found that one of the men I worked with was very condescending towards me and treated me in a way that he would never treat the daytime receptionist, and it probably had something to do with my gender.\n\n\n",

        "I don't care whether gay people get married - whatever lifestyle they choose is their decision, so as long as it doesn't harm anybody else, let them do what they want.  However, it might be easier to have the government view marriages as civil unions (just changing the name, not the benefits), as not  to discriminate between one marriage or the other. A constitutional amendmant banning gay marriage is just stupid. I can't fathom why one of the defining documents of the US would be tampered with to deal with such a relatively minor issue. Finally, if all the states agree with the same decision, I don't see how a federal law to some things up would be that bad.\n\n",

Other then that effect marijuana is harmful to your body and your mind.

The argument could be made that the effects are similar to those of alcohol, but i have seen them as having different effects.\n",
        "Dear CMCC Study,\n\nI'll have to try to put aside my strong distaste for myspace for the moment (it's a disgusting excuse for internet voyeurism and cheapens more legitimate forms of human interaction and communication). People need to keep in mind that myspace is an open forum. This means that anything posted on it can be viewed by anyone else. Myspace does have a \"privacy\" option, but I'd argue that anyone who places information they wouldn't want other sot see on the internet is asking for trouble.\n\nI think that since myspace is an open forum, school officials were within their rights to use the information they found posted. The student who was dumb enough to make the posting acted the same as if he had posted it on a regular billboard in a hallway somewhere.\n\nThere are, of course, limits to the lengths law enforcement and school officials can go, and I believe that those lines need to be more sharply delineated. The Supreme Court has dealt with the privacy rights of minors in the public education system many times before, but questions involving the internet are relatively new and need to be worked through. An important Supreme Court ruling in the 1960's (the name of which escapes me) involving students wearing arm bands in protest of the Vietnam War commented to the effect that \"Students do not leave their rights at the schoolhouse gate.\" I think that a students use of any form of internet communication which could reasonably be considered private should be respected as such.\n\nPeace,\n#6\n\n",
        "Gender discrimination is still an issue in the present-day United States.  The reason that it is much more so a question these days is because it is not as readily apparent and the trend has been steadily decreasing.  ECONOMY/SOCIETY CRIMEDiscrimination based on gender existed for many centuries before modern day society and that type of culture and thinking is embedded in to the thinking of the people.  Such a change from complete discrimination to none at all could not occur over night.  I believe this is the problem that we still see today, a left-over from the thinkin of the past.  There has been a great deal more of awareness made about the issue and I believe the mindset with which children are raised is beginning to be a lot more enlightening and open to diversity so that such issues will work themselves out of the culture within generations.\n\nThe business world is one of the major areas where sexual discrimination has been historically embedded, and because of that some of the left-over discrimination still exists.  The stereotype of good business relies on linguistic and communicational styles that are found inherently in man because business came to be in a world where men conquered that aspect will women stayed at home taking care of the home and children.  Today businesses are beginning to shift this mindset so that they are open to women and other diverse groups in the workplace.  They are beginning to see how strong business characteristics are inherent in women, they simply do not show them or express them in a similar manner so that males do not readily pick up on them.\n\nCertainly men, just like any other group with a unifying characteristic, are discriminated against.  It would be hard to argue that any given group has never been discriminated against.  There are certain aspects of society that men are kept out of as well as women.  The only difference is that our political and business systems make up a majority of the public eye and this is where gender discrimination in favor of men has historically taken place.\n\n",

The school officials in\nthis case were well within their rights. They recieved a threat to their\nstudents and they did something about it. This is what we would hope they\nwould do. And I think that if they didn't do anything about it because of\nthis kid's provacy rights people would be slightly upset!

        "Pot should be legal.  In small amounts it would only be used for personal use and without the distribution of it what is wrong with getting a little high once in a while.  The affects of getting drunk lead to violence, rape, impaired vision, and numerous other life threatening situations.  Getting high leads to increaded eating, laziness, and dare i say to much video game playing, i have never heard of the guy who smoked to much then went home and beat his wife, stole the car and then consequentely crashed it into the tree a block from his house.  It is one of the sadest realities of our country.  We will legalize alcohol and cigarettes which both have proven mental and physical health effects far worse than that of pot, but we wont legalize the weed.  IT is a flurishing underground market that needs to become mainstream.  If regulated and controlled properly, the marijuana industry could revolutionize the american trade market with numerous other countries.\n",
        "Privacy rights is a topic that is very difficult to discuss in that it is\nvery hard to draw a line as to what exactly constitutes private behavior\nand what constitutes public behavior.  Therefore, with the myspace\nexample, and with internet use in general, it is very hard to pick one\nside.  From what I understand about myspace, most everything a person\nposts is viewable by anybody who logs onto the service.  Actually, i'm not\nsure you even have to log on. I think you can just search for a person and\nview their information.  Which leads me to believe that was in fact, not\nan invasion of privacy at all.  It all has to do with intent.  To look at\nthe most basic form of privacy, the form innate to all humans, is the\nprivacy of our thoughts.  While uncountable thoughts run through our heads\neach day, we have the choice as to which thoughts we want to keep to\nourselves and which thoughts we want to vocalize, or make public, for\neveryone to hear. It is this choice, I believe, that determines whether or\nnot our actions are deemed as public or private.  If this student's intent\nwas for nobody to see the things he wrote, he should have posted somewhere\nwhere people couldn't see them, perhaps on his computer somewhere just in\na word document, or in a diary, or some other private form.  If he wanted\nseveral people to see what he wrote, but not certain other people, there\nare other options for doign this.  However, posting on myspace, where\nanyone who wants to read it can, is akin to running out in the middle of\nthe street, screaming that you want to kill people.\n\nEveryone has weird thoughts.  Everyone, I'm sure, has had at least for one\nmoment, thought about something that they would never ever want to share\nwith anyone. There's nothing wrong with that.  If you want to write it\ndown, go ahead and write it down somewhere.  But don't post it.  Don't let\nother people see it, unless you want them to.  But if you put yourself in\na situation where other people can freely see what you've written, without\nany devious means, then don't complain that they're invading your privacy,\nbecause it's your fault.\n",
        "I think that the issue of gay marriage should be one of state governments and not national government. Because many states are democratic and are supportive of gay marriage, i think it should be up to the governments of those states to decide rather than our republican president forcing his beliefs on the entire country. Although I'm not a complete supporter of homosexuality, I do have a lot of gay friends and I feel as though I would want them to be happy and able to have the same opportunities as heterosexual couples. I don't think that people should be judged or treated unfairly soley based on their sex preference and by banning gay marriage, that it what the government is doing.\n\n",
        "My thoughts on marijuana are that it should be legal for people over 21. Marijuana's effects aren't very similar to alcohol though.  The effects of marijuana are in fact much less inhibiting.  Alcohol causes you to slur your speech, fall over, overestimate your own abilities (such as being able to drive a car), and more or less deals a lot more damage healthwise (like it does to your liver and brain).\nMarijuana on the other hand slows down the thought process, gives you a lightheaded-highlike feeling, increases philosophical thought and significantly increases appetite.  While smoking anything can cause potential health risks, marijuana does much less damage to the brain than alcohol does.  In fact, some studies are beginning to point out some of the medical uses of marijuana, and one has even been set out to try to show that marijuana actually increases brain cell growth. If it were a match of which should be legal between alcohol and marijuana, my vote would go towards marijuana.  However, I feel that both should be legal anyway, especially since the effects of marijuana are much less detremental both in the short term and long term.  I've heard many incidents of drunk driving fatalities, but I haven't heard a single one of marijuana + driving fatalities.\n",
        "So what the country is trying to tell me is that I can kill myself with\ncigarettes alchohol and numerous other things but I am not allowed to\nsmoke pot? Killing yourself by merely ingesting marijuana is almost\nimpossible.  On top of this, pot does not have the physical addictablity\nthat alcohol or tobacco has.  Alcohol also can cause violent mood swings\nand aggressive behavior.  The worst that happens with marijuana is that\nyou mellow out and get a little hungry.  If the government were to\nlegalize and regulate marijuana they could first of all make money off of\nit.  There are taxes on alcohol and cigarettes that make the prices high,\nthe same could be done with pot.  Also it would take the danger  of the\ndrug being cut with something else by the dealer out of the equation. \nMarijuana could have massive medical implications, but due to its\nillegality we have no idea.  At the moment only some states allow\nmedicinal marijunana for terminal patients.  I think a big problem is the\nvillanization that has been attached to marijana as well.  It will not\n\"ruin your life\" as some other drugs will do.  I have a big problem with\nmarijuana being grouped with other illicit drugs such as heroin cocaine\nand ectasy which are much more dangerous and addictive.  It is nowhere\nnear the level of these.  I truly believe that pot is on the same level as\ncigarettes and alcohol.  If one of these three is allowed then all should\nbe.  If one is not the others should not be legal either. They are too\nclose in affect to seperate them.\n\n",
        "  I do not think that a myspace page or bulletin investigation or\nmonitoring is against the law. People who sighn up for those particular\ntype of websites know that it is open to the public and that anyone can\nsearch of you and find out informatino. It is actually a bit scary if\nyou think about it, because now that society has become so digitalized\nwe are all leaving traces or ourselves or footprints out in cyberspace\nthat can be easily tracked by just about anyone.\n   One has to realize that anything that is done on a computer and put on\nthe internet is liable to be there forever in some form or another and\nis able to be looked at or viewed by almost anyone. That is why it is\ncalled the World Wide Web. It streaches accross contenents to\neverywere.\n   In regardes to other pricavy laws, such as the tapping of phone\nconversatinos and phone lines, i do not necissarily like this idea, but\ni do realize that it is for our protection. I dont really feel like I\nhave anything to really worry about, because honestly if some\ngovernmental agency were to listen in to my converstation randomly they\nwould be very dissappointed because most of my conversatinos are quite\nsilly and have not content about polotics or anything of that matter.\n   I like it that they are able to stop people from commiting crimes\nthough, just by listening to people talk. ON the other hand, this idea\nis very creepy. It is almost like that whole \"big brother\" \"father'\nthing of the story 1984 by George Orwell. Basically anything one does\nis monitored and I dont really like the idea of people listeing to my\nconversations to my mom or to friends. Yes I feel like it is an\ninvasion of privacy, and I wish it did not have to be done. I feel like\nit used to be that only if certain words poped up in a sentence, such\nas \"bomb, war, terrorist, presiden, etc.\"  then your conversation would\nbe monitored. I am not sure if that is how it quite works now.\n   FOr the patriot act, bacically it is just a freindly name to help\ndisguise what its true funcion is....to take away more or our privacy\nand freedoms, yet while I know this I am afraid to say that i am a bit\nrusty on what the details of this act are. I just know that it sounds\nfriendly and helpful and in reality it is not as nice as it seems.\n   When it comes to the safty of others though, going back to the school,\nI do not think that there really sould be any line drawn. The school\nshooter could have killed many lives, and with what just happened at VT\nlast year, I would be more then happy if any school shooters were\ncaught beforhand. THere are some rights that we should just accept as\ngiven, and some we should take as gifts but realize that people are\ngoing to monitor them to keep us safe. I feel that as long as this last\npart...to keep us safe....is kept in this strick regards, then we\nshould be fine, but we need to make sure that the government or school\nofficials do not go too power hungry.\n\n",
        "I think gender discrimination is very much still an issue in the US workplace, and will be for probably the rest of my lifetime.  There has been a lot of progress in this area though, aspecially recently as more and more women become well paid executives.  Women are discriminated against daily, and not just in pay.  The way they are treated by men in the workplace, especially their bosses, is discrimination by its very definition.  Many women are not treated equally, and not treated the same as men.  Whenever a man makes a comment about a woman's body, or a boss pinches a butt, that's discrimination.  It's demeaning for the woman, and in many cases can cause her to feel uncomfortable in the workplace and even have to change jobs.  The workplace should be an equal playing field for everyone, women shouldn't be made to feel inferior like that.  Noone should have to feel that their boss is coming on to them, and think \"Oh, maybe if I just sleep with him just once, he'll open a trapdoor in the glass ceiling.\"  That ceiling just shouldn't be there in the first place.\n\nPay is becoming much more equal in the salaried desk jobs where it was first raised as an issue.  Overall, women are hired much more often, which was the first big step.  Company regulations about pay and treatment are much stricter for fear of lawsuit.  Yet you still hear about the woman getting paid 75% of what a man doing her same job is getting, or the woman who enters an interview and leaves with \"I'm sorry, you're just not what we're looking for.\"  Eventually, the way things are going, this will hopefully disappear from society.\n\nMen are discriminated against in the workplace as well.  In traditionally female occupations like nurse or daycare provider, they may not only be teased by co-workers but by anyone they meet.  However, the discrimination against men does not usually include such aspects as pay discrimination or unwanted sexual attention, so it is not as serious.  I think it's rare for a man to leave his job because the workplace environment was made uncomfortable by excessive teasing.  This is also becoming less and less prevalent as men appear on TV doing traditionally female things – as hairstylists on Project Runway and What Not to Wear, as nurses on ER and Grey's Anatomy, and in many other roles.\n\nThe same thing is happening to women, as more and more women appear in positions of power in popular TV shows.  Like it or not, TV is a powerful influence on society today.  Trends are set through TV, and it teaches us social norms.  By seeing women running businesses on TV, men believe it is more acceptable when they see it done in real life.  This also means that younger generations will grow up accepting these things as normal.  As long as powerful women are portrayed in a positive light and respected on TV, the younger generation will fell that it is acceptable for a woman to have a higher paying job than her husband, and to even be a top CEO.  Women will be known for performing differently then men, but no better and no worse.  It will be seen as good to have the differing perspectives of men and women working together on one issue.\n\nParents need to help along this change in sentiment by talking about women in a positive light in front of their children.  Negative attitudes like \"That's not her place\" and \"She should be home with the kids\" are what will drag potentially successful women down.  Also, parents should encourage their female children to choose challenging professions, and to educate them about the variety of possibilities open to them.  When all of these things come about, discrimination will truly no longer be an issue in the workplace.\n\n",
        "Dear CMC Study,\n\nPlease give me a minute to compose myself...\n\nOkay, the war in Iraq was a monstrously bad idea. I don't see any two ways about it. It's introduced even more instability into a region that wasn't exactly a sterling example of U.S.-friendly feelings to begin with. Furthermore, I think that many of the unacknowledged motivations for the war were economic, and hundreds of thousands of people have died because of those motivations (blood oil in your gasoline tank, anyone?).\n\nI don't think the war should continue. I think the warring factions in Iraq realize that it really isn't to anyone's advantage to continuously fight each other, though this will probably continue to happen for sometime. By many accounts, much of the animosity in Iraq is directed at the occupying forces (us). I think that if we pulled out now, the country would remain unstable for a period, but would move into a relatively calm position within a reasonable amount of time.\n\nAnd the Bush administration should really stop rolling dice when it comes to foreign policy.\n\nPeace,\n#6\n",
        "    The Catholic Church is one of the most conservative and regressive groups in the world.  They act like they are separate from the rest of civilization.  For one, the Cathiolic Church is not inclusive when it comes to other groups.  For example, they are entirely opposed to gay people as a people, let alone allowing them to marry.  They like to downplay their views against it, but it is a fact that they see homosexuality as a sin.  Could you imagine being considered a sinner for having curly hair?  Homosexuality is a genetic trait, not a life choice.  The Catholic Church either does not understand this, or does not care to know the truth.  Thee reason for this, in my opinion, is that they are afraid to admit they were wrong for taking such a hard stance against homosexuality.  They try to doctrinize everything they say or do, because after all, the pope is infallible, right?  The Catholic Church is such a backwards organization.  Whatever they proclaim, others must accept - no questions asked.\n    In today's world, science plays an enormous role.  In the scientific community, one must have evidence to support one's conclusion.  Not so with the Catholic Church.  They say things are the way they are because \"God said so.\"  This method of thinking is completely ridiculous.  No one even knows if there is a God to begin with.  The Catholic Church could be living in a fantasy world. \n    The Catholic Church has a dogma known as \"transsubtantiation.\"  According to this dogma, the eucharistic bread and wine is actually the body and blood of Jesus Christ - not a symbol thereof.  No one is going to tell me that bread and wine magically becomes human flesh and blood when a priest consecrates it.  It can be a symbol, but it is still bread and wine.\n    The entire pedophilia scandal confuses me.  Why have so many priests been guilty of molesting young boys?  There is a definite trend, but I need to know the reason why before I can come to a conclusion.  My feeling is that any human being, priest or not, needs some form of sexual satisfaction.  That is simply that way the human body is.  For priests, who are required to stay celibate, the easiest way to get this satisfaction without anyone knowing about it, is to molest young boys.  If priests were allowed to marry, they would be fully able to satisfy their carnal desires.  But no, the Catholic Church still relies upon the teachings of St. Augustine, who said that taking pleasure in sex in sinful.  Its 2006.  Let priests marry.  They would be happier, and they wouldn't be so inclined to molest boys.  Wanting to have sex is not a sin - its human nature.  But apparently the Catholic Church is above human nature too.\n",

Maybe Afghanistan again, we\nforgot about them.  Maybe Bin Laden is still there!  Maybe we should\ninvade ourselves! Because hey, if you look at us seriousely, we are the\nmost dangerous country.  And we are dangerous to ourselves and to everyone\nelse who might look at Bush funny.  So lets just invade ourselves and get\nit over with before we do something like destroy some random country like\nIraq. Oops.  Too late.\n\n",
        "Well, I do not think it is the church, but more the people within the church. Honestly, there are corrupt people everywhere. I think that the pedophilia issues created a bad image for the church...there are so many good priests, and these twisted men just ruined it. I think that the church has adapted its ways to conform to the 21st century. I don't think that we should have female priests though. I have grown up with the idea of male priests and it would just be weird if it were anything different. Like on the show 7th Heaven..I find it weird that the the daughter Lucy is a minister! I do not think that these acts could have been avoided. You cannot change the way people are born, people cannot be tested for a pedophile gene just like they cannot be tested for a gene that will make them a rapist. The question could be found in the pool of people that become priests. Maybe we are recruiting the wrong type of men?\n",
        "Privacy vs. safety, personal rights vs. collective security, these are\nextremely pressing issues in today's day in age, when a large portion of\nthe world honestly detests many aspects of America.  We are losing friends\nfast in Europe, and most of the developing world, while desparately\nwanting to come here and earn a decent living, holds us in quiet contempt\nfor our sheerly excessive comfort material wealth.\n\nWhy do we have these enemies?  Why is it that I, an American citizen, have\nto be EXTREMELY careful and watch my back if I travel to many places in\nthe world?  Why is it that there are certain places I simply can't travel\nto?  Why is there so much animosity aimed at the American public that our\ngovernment has to establish tremendous new bureaus just to protect our\n\"homeland security\"?  From where did this threat arise, and who is\naccountable?  What did I do to deserve this?\n\nThe answer is, we, the majority of American people, did nothign to deserve\nthis.  We are just so far removed from the suffering which exists all over\nthe world that we, all too often, unknowlingly perpetuate it through our\nexercise of economic domination.\n\nSo basically, the American government can do what it will to protect our\nsafety.  I have nothing to hide, so I'm not really scared.  Im sure that,\nin twenty years, when we are allowed to see exactly what the intelligence\ncommunity was doing in 2007 in terms of operations, we will just shake our\nheads and say \"that's messed up\".\n\nAnd honestly, I have some qualms and questions about this study, such as\nexactly why the NSA is paying college students for their political views\n(I'm not really pointing fingers, but somethign about this strikes a very\nOrwellian tone), and if this is really a study about how people\ncommunicate, then why are its test subjects  affluent, priveleged,\nenglish-speaking, American college students?  Why weren't we just told\nwhat is going on?\n\nEven if my essay will never be linked back to my name, which I suspect\nthey probably will, I didn't hide what I truly thought about privacy, and\nat times, even got a little mad as I was writing.  Well, I'm done now\n(completing my last email), but thanks for the opportunity.\n\n",
        "    I think gay marriage should be legalized in all states. Some argue that gay marriage undermines the sacredness of marriage in general. However, I believe that two people, regardless of gender, can faithfully devote themselves to each other if they truly love one another.\n    I do not think the government has any authority in deciding who can and can not get married. The only arguments against gay marriage are all based on opinion. No legitimate, objective reasons for making it illegal have been put forth, and that is why the federal government should have no say in the matter.\n",
        "\n    The war in Iraq is a very tricky topic to say the least. I myself\nbelieve that we should get out of there because we are just loosing\ntons of soldiers. I understand that the entire reason why we entered\ninto the war was because of the attack of September 11th, but honestly\nas we have found out more and more it just does not make sences to\nkeep on fighting.\n   Originally we thought that the terrorists that attacked us were linked\nto osama bin laden, but as we later found out, that was not the case.\nInstead our president George W. Bush just used the escuse of the attack\nto go in and capture him. Well, we have done that and in the mean while\nwe have totally pissed off many of the terrorists groups such as the\ntalliban, and we have left Iraq in shambles.\n   IN a way i am glad that osama bin laden is off the market, though this\ncould have happened a lot sooner if Bill Clinten acted when he had the\nchance too, and then perhaps we would not even have been in this much\nof a mess as we are in right now. Yet I am not entirly sure why we are\nstill in Iraq. Well no, I take that back.\n   I do know that we are there because we got rid of their main\ngovernmental system, and that we have been working with them to have\nthem make their own governmental system, but it is taking an extreemly\nlong time. THe tricky part is that we can not leave too soon otherwise\nit would be like the catastrophy of when Russia invaded Afganistan.\nThey invaded a while back and then pulled out too soon and more\ncorruption just ivolved instead of any good coming of it, so I know\nthat is why we can not pull out right away from Iraq. However, I feel\nlike they are very much on thier way to running themselves. I do not\nreally understand why we have to keep sending more and more soldiers\nover there when they are trying to become more self suficient.\nWouldn't our sending troups over there send the message that we do not\ntrust them?\n   Perhaps it has to do with how long particular soldiers are allowed to\nbe out and on missions. I know that after a few months they are\nrequired to come home, so perhaps it just sounds like we are sending\nmore troups over there when in fact they are jsut replacing those that\nare coming home.\n   IN any regards, I don't like the fact that we are over there now, but\nunderstand why we can't pull out all of a sudden. I just wish that\nthere somehow was a faster way that we could get ourselves out of this\nmess, and unfortunatly I dont think that there ever will be, because\nterrorists seem to be like the idea of evoking fear into every nation\n(not just ours).\n\n\n",
        "\nIn reference to this situation, invading the person's privacy is the\nproper action that the school took and I fully support them on that issue.\nBut soemtimes schools take it too far. At my old high school, which is a\ncatholic all girls institution, they expelled some girls because of\npictures they had on facebook. Granted the internet is a big free-for-all\nbut still I believed it was wrong of the school to do that. Now there are\nmany other issuses included in this particular one but the main fact is\nthat the school went online saw these pictures of the girls and expelled\nthem. Ok maybe i should explain a little more, the pictures were taken at\nthe high school, while the girls were in their uniform and the pictures\nwere of sexy girl on girl action. Now don't think pornography but either\nway it was girl on girl action. Is that still grounds for an expulsion,\nmaybe? But still the method in which they used to find these pictures is\nwhere I am finding the fault.\n\nSchools have to realize that the internet is a place where students can go\nto vent about their \"tragic teenage lives\" so they may say some things\nthat make the school systems wonder, the schools ultimately can not make\nany hasty decisions unless it was like our starting situation of the\nschool shooting. Schools should have a list of a criteria that warrant a\nsearch or immediate action, before engaging the students. But back to the\ninitial question of where should school officials draw the line ass to\nwhether or not they are invading privacy? Well my answer is safety and not\nreputation. Meaning my school may have expelled the girls because they\ndidn't want the reputation of a Catholic all girls high school that\npromoted lesbian actions . All in all safety school be the schools number\none concern, once a student goes so far as to say they may hurt someone\nelse or themselves even if they were just venting actions need to be taken\nbecause you never know if they really meant what they were said.\n\n",
        "Marriage is a legal right that everyone in the country deserves to have.  If mentally challenged people with Down's syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome have the right to get married and have children, how on earth can we deny that same right to homosexual couples who are functioning members of society?  People say that gay marriage is against their religion – well their religion isn't the issue here.  Under the Constitution, they have the same right to practice that religion as they always have, and to deny the marriage of homosexuals within their own churches and institutions.  But states aren't trying to make priests perform marriages between two gay people - the only right on debate here is the right for two male or two female names to be on the same marriage certificate.  There is no way that if gay marriage is legalized, you'll walk into church one day and have to watch two men kiss at the altar.  This is in no way the issue, and what needs to happen is that people see that.  America has to look at this issue objectively, without the emotional reasoning that thinking about it in terms of religion brings.  Only then will we as a country come to see that we are denying people basic rights in the name of nothing more than personal belief.\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of gay marriage?  People say that homosexual couples threaten the validity of heterosexual marriage and somehow make it less special.  But homosexual and heterosexual couples are so fundamentally different, and yet so similar, that this will in no way happen.  Living with a partner of the same sex can't be the same as living with one of the opposite sex, yet they share the same feelings and roles in relationships, go through the same problems, and want the same things out of a marriage.  Some people look at homosexuals as simply promiscuous people who want sex all the time without the possibility of pregnancy or commitment.  From that standpoint, yes, homosexual marriage would make the institution of marriage look bad.  But in fact, this is a stereotype that is in no way true.  Homosexual couples have rates of commitment and break-up similar to heterosexual couples.  Many live their whole lives together, sharing every experience the same way a married man and woman do.  How could a committed couple make marriage look bad?\n\nThere is no way the federal government should be involved in this issue, unless the constitutionl amendment changes the definition of marriage to include the union between homosexual couples at all.  The separation of church and state should keep Bush from passing such an amendment, because other than a phrase written down over 100 years ago and some \"morals\" conferred on him by his religion, there is nothing behind his push.  Such an amendment would be a dangerous thing for the Republican party to pass, since the gay population is a growing minority who has a vested interest in the matter.  Besides, the federal government has a responsibility to protect the rights of those under it, not take them away.  Whose rights are protected by banning gay marriages?  The rights of heterosexual couples to be the only ones with a marriage certificate?  That seems like s snobbish kind of right to protect.  What about the rights of old ladies not to be offended by seeing a wedding performed between two men?  Well, we defended the right of old ladies not to see a black man and a white woman holding hands in public not so long ago.  That defense was known as the Jim Crow laws.  Is that really where we see ourselves at the beginning of 2007??\n\n",
        "I think that the war has definitly gone on on long enough. Becuase I was\ngreatly affected by 9/11 I can see why Bush sprung into action so quickly.\nAt that time when everyone was emotional, I would have done the same\nthing. There was no other option. We could just not retaliate. However, we\nhave been over there for years now and have made little progress and have\nspent way too much money into trying to better another country that, in my\nopinion, will be in ruins for years to come. If they cannot even get along\nwith each other, then how are we suppose to go in there and expect to\nchange their minds and ways of life. There is no way. I think by staying\nthere we are just digging ourselves into a deeper hole. We are loosing\nsoldiers and money to what has no become a lost cause. I feel that the\nonly way that we can do anything is by bringing our troops home and\nheightening security on the homefront. That is the best that we can do. We\ncannot keep getting ourselves tangled in other countries' affairs.\nAlthough we are not going to be there, we still have to keep an eye on\nthem because whether we like it or not, Iraq and the Middle East will\nalways be our problem.\n\n"

        "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
        "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
        "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
        "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
        "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
        "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
        "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

        "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
        "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

        "Ok \nUm \nThe war \nUm \nAt first I was all for it because I was affected by nine eleven personally \nUm \nI was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much havoc as they did over here \nUm \nI do think that since it was such a like emotional thing that happened \nI think that we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run \nAnd we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan \nAnd um \nI really think that it backfired on us \nUm \nI uh \nI don’t know \nI was all for it \nBut now I’m very against it \nI don’t think it did anything \nUm \nI think the people over there \nAs long as they’re fighting with each other they can’t be fighting with us as well \nLike I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re \nIf they can’t even get along with themselves \nSo um \nLike unfortunately because of nine eleven I’ve almost just \nI just don’t care about what goes on over there \nUm \nWith those people \nI just don’t care \nI just think \nI don’t think that \nSometimes I don’t think they’re human \nI don’t know \nLike they fight with each other and they can’t \nThey just can’t do anything themselves \nSo I really don’t care \nUm \nI don’t know \nWe definitely went over there just unprepared \nWe didn’t know like what we were gonna face over there \nUm \nAnd it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war if for us \nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country \nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there \nAnd I think that should be fine for us \nI think we should just leave and that’s really it \nUm \nWe just \nI think we were just more like \nJust hyped up than anything \nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and \nUm \nI just \nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened \nAnd um \nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq \nUm \nBut at the time I see where he was coming from \nWe really \nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it \nSo \nUm \nI don’t think we could have let it go \nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do \nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order \nAnd I don’t know \nI just think that they didn’t \nThere was no like unity \nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for \nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more \nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with \nSo that’s what we created in turn in there \nUm \nAnd \nHonestly I don’t \nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people \nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that \nAnd um \nI don’t \nI really don’t have anything else to say \nIt’s gone one definitely long enough \nUm \nI don’t think we’re making enough progress \nLike we’ve made progress \nBut not enough to stay in there \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there \nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse \nAnd we can’t stay over there forever \nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there \nNo \nOk \n"
