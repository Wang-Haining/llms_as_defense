        "\tGay marriage should be legalized in every state.  It is wrong to discriminate against someone for any reason, especially if that reason is not under his or her control.  Many people say that homosexuals are just confused or sick with a disease and they can choose to be straight.  Logically, that is completely ridiculous.  No person would ever voluntarily submit themselves to the pain and anguish a homosexual and his or her family inevitably goes through when that person finally “comes out of the closet.”  This pain is caused by the media and its everyday assistance in painting an embarrassing picture of homosexuals in general.  Therefore, no person holds the right to label a couple’s love for one another as wrong simply because both members of the couple are of the same sex.\n\tFurthermore, the Federal government should have no say regarding a couple’s right to marriage.  Marriage is neither a legal nor moral concern, nor is it a matter of national security.  It is a right that any two people should have to graft their lives together in a beautiful act of love for one another.  To deny someone’s right to marriage is a violation of their rights as a human being.  Unless the government can present a legitimate reason for the banning of gay marriage, it should be legalized in every state in this country.\n",
        "\tRecent media around the United States has boosted the topic of gay “marriages” to the point where you see it everywhere. I am not a supporter or a hater of gay men or women, but I do have a problem with people acknowledging a wedlock between two of the same sex. I can see where people come from on both sides of the debate. It is obvious how people can be offended by it, but I can also see how people can not help themselves if they are gay or straight- it was apparently the way that they were born. I believe that gays should be able to become a couple legally, but not through the word “marriage.”\n\n\t“Marriage,” according to www.dictionary.com, is “the social institution under which a man and woman establish their decision to live as husband and wife by legal commitments, religious ceremonies, etc.” This definition of the word allows no room for arguments. This mentions both legal and religious issues- two issues that people argue about when the subject is brought up. Nowhere in this description mentions a man and a man, or a woman and another woman being together. Since the definition of the word “marriage” is described as this, I believe that another word, such as “partnership,” etc., should be used in place of “marriage.” I have witnessed the conversation between a gay and straight person where the straight male asked the gay male how he knew if he was gay or not. The response of the gay man was asking the opposing straight man how he knew if he was straight or not. The gay man’s argument was that he could not help it, and that it was as natural as being straight.\n\n\tEven though one of these men was straight and the other gay, they are both United States Citizens and live under the U.S. Constitution. What this means is that every person has the same guaranteed rights to live their lives by. What people need to realize is that our country was based upon Christian principles. I can not see how changing these founding principles can be a good thing. The best option is to work around, not change, these words written so long ago. As said earlier, a bind between a two men or women could be called a “partnership.” If this wording existed, then a marriage could still be a sacred unity between a man and a woman in Christianity. This would both respect our country’s founding religion and please the rapidly changing modern views of U.S. citizens.\n\n\tSince George W. Bush is the leader of this Christian-based country, he needs to realize the fact that he needs to live up to the wants of our nation. While pleasing our citizens, President Bush should also be keeping in touch with the basis of our country. A simple change of words is the solution to all of these problems. There is no fighting the fact that the United States government was founded on Christian beliefs- beliefs that a marriage consists of a man and a woman. If you change a religion so that it suits your personal interests, then you are not committed enough to your religion. Allowing “gay marriages” would precisely be doing this- changing the religion to suit modern wants, not needs. Even though this one word is a small step, the change of it will be powerful enough to stop all of the problems it is creating in the United States. \n",
        "\tThe states that have legalized gay marriage are more humane, and thus right on the issue.  It is not the business of any state, government, or otherwise to interfere with the loving relationship between two humans.  Governments were established in the best interest of the citizens and to ensure justice; since when did the governments make it their business to impede on the social and private lives of the citizens when it comes to what relationships they can or can not legally have.  \n\tScientifically speaking, it has been proven that men or women who are homosexual are born with this tendency or desire.  As far as this pertains to the church, if it is their belief that God is the creator of human life thus making it sacred, then there is further fault in their stance on gay marriage.  If God creates all humans, even the ones with homosexual tendencies as a part of their genealogical structure, then they too deserve the sacred bonds that God has made in marriage for his human creations.  \n\tAs far as the federal government’s involvement in the issue, it is completely and utterly wrong.  The government has no right to govern such a diverse country on religious issues.  When there are Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the same country, there is no justifiable way for them to back any law on a strictly conservative Christian stance.  Religion is certainly not a science and is extremely subjective in its interpretation, so for the government to use it as a means to support something like the banning of gay marriage is impractical and demoralizing to their credibility.\n\tThe way families are constructed in more recent history has changed a great deal, and this is just one more example of the Christian Church’s need to modernize.  Science has brought fourth evidence of a person’s genealogical structure that shows they have sexual preference encoded in their DNA.  It would suit the church best to respect the new findings of science and change their view accordingly.\n\tThe family can still flourish and the same love can evolve out of homosexual set of parents.  Adoption and new ways of creating offspring such as invitro fertilization or surrogate motherhood have made families possible for homosexual parents.  If they can legally create a family in one of the aforementioned manners and can still provide for the family in the same way heterosexual parents could, then certainly family life is no reason to ban gay marriage.  \n\tIf the problem with legalizing gay marriage has to do with Christian approval, then the state can call the bond something such as “civil bond.”  The government has no business tying its policies to religion in the first place, but if that is a thought that perhaps there should be a state-sanctioned name that grants the marriage as a legal action from the state or country, as opposed to a religion.  This route would ensure there remains a separation from church and state and gay marriage could flourish as an act of a free country and not a behind-the-times religion. \n",
        "\tGay marriage has become a strong issue in the United States today. Everyone seems to have an opinion on the issue. Personally, I believe that Gay marriage should be completely legalized in the United States. Some states have legalized this, where as some states want to completely ban it.\n\tCurrently, President Bush is trying to propose an amendment that will ban gay marriage. I think this is absolutely ridiculous. Who gives our government the right to say who we can and cannot marry? The only restriction that heterosexual couples have regarding marriage is the age: you must be 18. Why should homosexual couples be faced with any more restrictions? It is wrong to say that two people who are in love are not able to get married, no matter what their sexual preference is.\n\tThere are two people and they have fallen in love. They care about each other, and are looking to get married and start a family. They want a wedding to show their friends and family that they are devoted to each other and for legal reasons. Married couples have rights when it comes to legal issues for their spouse. These seem like pretty normal reasons to want to be married. So why does it matter if these people are men and women, men and men, or women and women?\n\tThere was a case in the news recently where a lesbian was in the hospital on life support. Her parents were there and so was her partner. Her parents wanted to end her life; they felt that she should not be living on life support. However, her partner knew that she would have wanted to try to live on machines, but because there was no legal tie between the two women, her partner had no rights. How is that fair?\n\tIn many cases homosexual couples are still able to adopt children. These family styles are becoming more and more common in our society. If a couple is allowed to have a child, why should they not be able to be married? No one stands in the way of heterosexual couples. Right now I could find a heterosexual partner and walk into a courthouse or a chapel in Las Vegas. With little difficulty I would be able to marry this heterosexual partner. But if I wanted a homosexual marriage, forget it. \n\tThere are such ridiculous views held by people in our country against homosexuality. Very few homosexuals are trying to push their views onto you; they would just like to be able to live their lives normally. \n\tStudies have been conducted that say being homosexual may be genetic. So how would you like it if you were born with brown hair (another genetic trait) and you were not able to get married? It doesn’t seem so fair when we look at it that way. \n\tPassing an amendment that would ban gay marriages seems like such a drastic move. Why should our country be so biased against citizens that are equal to us? In the United States we have the same rights; we have freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, the freedom of press. This should be no different. There should be nothing standing in the way of homosexual couples.\n",
        "Subject Number 15:\n\n3. PRIVACY RIGHTS:  Recently, school officials prevented a school shooting because one of the shooters posted a myspace bulletin.  Do you think this was an invasion of privacy?  Where should school officials draw the line as to whether or not they are invading privacy?\n\n\n\tI do not feel that school officials looking at a myspace bulletin or page is an invasion of privacy. I feel that anything posed on the internet without restrictions is fair game for anyone to see, including that of authoritative figureheads or even governmental officials.\n\tPeople post on pages that are visible to the public solely for the purpose of other people reading it. Sometimes I feel that it is a cry out for help, for those that are not strong enough to actually go out and do it in person. If a student was planning on showing up to school and shooting a bunch of people, but first posted this intension, I feel that he was one of these people asking for help. \n\tSometimes it is so hard to seek help that one will do anything to obtain it. Shooting would certainly cure the problem of not gaining any help, but someone who could talk to him before he actually shot and killed innocent lives would be even more beneficial, not only to the saved victims, but also to the shooter, because now he does not have to live the rest of his life in sorrow and morning. It is one less thing for him to have to talk about with remorse behind it. \n\tAs to where the line for school officials should be drawn, I feel that it is fair to say that if a student thinks that they have set into play a security action plan (or privacy settings) that they should be able to trust that. Those settings were put into place on the page or program for a reason, and that is to prevent others form seeing or reading what it is that they have written. They are not asking for help in this form or fashion, and so thus should be respected into what type of privacy they desire. \n\tWhat it really again boils down to, is that if you are asking for help, it will find its way out, but if you are just writing to write something down and relieve one's emotions, then ones should not need to further their emotions to the public or have to explain them. Privacy should be honored by all parties if a privacy setting is put into place.\n\tI am glad that the school officials were able to catch this potential school shooter before it actually happened though. I wish that they or someone was able to do the same thing at Virginia Tech last year. However, it is best to take the horrible situation that happened at Virginia Tech seriously and at the same time also learn form their mistakes. I know that had his initial privacy been invaded then he would be extremely upset and angry, however it is better a temper then an outright shooting. \n\tOverall, I feel that if you show signs, or needed to be watched for a little while for others and your own safety, it is ok to be invasive of private property. However, if you do not exhibit any traits then their should be no reason for school officials to just randomly investigate its students. \n",
        "      I think that is it good that school officials were able to prevent a school shooting, regardless of how they came about this information.  Which issue is more important:  the death of a student, or the fact that a student’s privacy might have been violated?  In my opinion, there is a clear cut answer:  the student’s life is much more important.  Frankly, I don’t even really see this as an invasion of privacy, since the information was posted on the Internet.  The information on the Internet is available for millions of people to see and when you post anything online, you need to be aware of this fact.\n\tEven though I am glad that the school official saw the bulletin on myspace since it saved a student’s life, we can still ask the question of whether or not this was an invasion of privacy.  To do so, we must know how the school official came across the information.  While I do not have a myspace profile myself, I know that myspace has certain privacy controls.  One of the settings is that you must grant someone permission to see your profile.  If this student had this setting on, then in order for the school official to have read the posting, the student must have granted the school official access to his or her profile.  If this was the case, then it was not an invasion of privacy, since the student gave permission.  If the student did not have this setting on, then he or she must be aware that anyone who has access to the Internet also potentially has access to view the information that is posted in his or her myspace profile.  If this was the case, then I still do not see this as an invasion of privacy, since the student posted information that is visible to everyone.  When ever you post any information on the Internet, you must realize that virtually anyone has access to this information.  Thus, it is up to you to monitor what you post.  If there is something that you do not want everyone to see, then you must be responsible and sensor what you post.  Think twice before putting anything on the Internet, because you never know who will be reading it.\n\tNow, all of that said, I will admit that it is a little weird and we must question why the school official was looking at the student’s myspace profile.  (I am happy that he or she was looking at it since it prevented possible loss of lives, but I will admit that it is kind of strange.)  Was the school official just randomly on the Internet and just happened to see this bulletin?  I highly doubt it.  What is more likely is that this student was suspected of being up to something or was profiled as a troubled kid.  The school official was most likely intentionally looking at this student’s profile in an effort to come up with more information.  It is hard to say where to draw the line here.  On the one hand, you might say that a school official should not be sitting around snooping through students’ myspace profiles.  But I still can’t get over the fact that had this school official not done this, innocent lives might have been lost. And to me, it is more important that lives are saved, than that we protect the privacy of teenagers.  \n",
        "\tThe Catholic Church has very old roots, and while it is important for it to remember its ancient beginnings, it also important for the Church to be an institution that is compatible with the lives of modern people.  This is good both for the people and the Church, for the people can find comfort and spirituality in a place that accepts their modern lifestyle, and the Church can attract followers by appealing to a variety of people.  Unfortunately, the modern Catholic Church does not live up to these ideals.  The Church is very often too traditional in its views, which means both that the religion appeals to less people, and that the Church is not reaching out to as many people as it could if the Church were more liberal.  \n\tWith the wide variety of lives people live in today’s world, a religion should be able to embrace them all and teach them spirituality and theology.  The Catholic Church, however, rejects many people from hearing the message it is trying to spread.  Homosexuals are not accepted in the Catholic faith, and neither are those who were not baptized Catholic.  The Catholic Church is so extreme in its views that it will refuse to marry a Catholic to a non-Catholic.  In a world where diversity is prominent and  inter-faith marriages are common, the traditionalist view that Catholics should only marry Catholics is outdated and intolerant.  For a Church whose message involves loving others, it is hypocritical to shut the Church doors at homosexuals and non-Catholics, among others.\n\tWithin the structure of the Church itself, the Catholic Church has many strict rules, which have been in existence for many years, but which do not fit into the context of modern society.  For example, women cannot become priests, and the men who do become priests are sworn to celibate, unmarried lives.  A life of religious teaching would be much more attractive to males if the requirements for being a priest were less stringent, because in a society where celibacy goes against the norm, the vow of celibacy means becoming substantially different from the rest of society.  If this rule were not so strict, more people would probably pursue the religious life, and the Church would grow and strengthen.  Priests would feel like they were sacrificing less, and be more content with their professions, and also probably be more likely to satisfy sexual desires through acts of pedophilia.  If women were allowed to become priests, again the Church would grow, and would be more consistent with the goal of gender equality that the modern society is trying to reach.\n\tThe Catholic Church has a lot to benefit by becoming more compatible with modern people.  It needs to loosen its strict rules if it wants to continue to be an attractive religion to people whose views are constantly being expanded and are learning the meaning of tolerance.  Over time, if the Catholic Church does not change, its extremely conservative views will lead a liberal society to think it intolerant and outdated.\n\n\n",
        "\tMarriage under the law is a civil institution to which all age-eligible U.S. citizens should be entitled. To say that marriage is a sacred institution between a man and women conflates a religious view of it with a secular one, which is not the business of the federal government. There is no good reason I can think of that gay people shouldn’t be allowed to get married. The bias against gay marriage reflects a deeply ingrained homophobia in American culture that we still haven’t rid ourselves of, for no apparent reason. Furthermore, I don’t think that the federal government needs to be mixing in this issue; it will ultimately be determined by the courts anyway.\n\tMany advocates of gay marriage have already made the point that heterosexual marriages can be loveless, estranged, or even abusive, and these are still fully sanctioned in the U.S. Really, I can’t foresee gay marriages possibly ending in worse terms than some straight ones already do. \n\tThe sole argument against gay marriage seems to be the one employing that oft-repeated “sacred institution” phrase. It might be a sacred institution in some religious practices, and organized religions are free to ban or accept whatever forms of marriage they want. It isn’t a sacred institution when a couple fills out some paperwork and is granted a marriage license, however, and that’s the only part of the government’s involvement that has any legal ramifications – marriages administered by justices of the peace and others notwithstanding, since they are officiating secular ceremonies. The law doesn’t stop gays from applying for driver’s licenses or gay bar owners from applying for liquor licenses; stopping them from getting a marriage license just does not make sense.\n\tAnyone who wants to have their relationship status as a married couple sanctioned by the federal government should be able to (with some exceptions for age and a few other factors). Gays are just as likely to have happy, healthy relationships, and even raise and provide good care for adopted children. It should not be the business of the government to go around denying recognition of this.\n\tI think that there is a generic threatened feeling that most straight males experience when they confront the notion of homosexuality. This could be because of cultural conditioning; in America, the idea of the macho Sylvester Stallone type has a very broad appeal, and that homosexuality endangers this. It could also be a leftover from a hunter-gatherer kind of instinct that details what a man should be on a subconscious level. Whatever it is, men need to get over it. I have mentioned men exclusively here, because it seems to me that women feel less threatened by the idea of lesbianism, for whatever reason. That is not to say that some women do not feel that way, but it seems as though in general this is not the case.\n\tIn the end, state supreme courts will be the ones to decide the issue on a case by case basis. The attempt at an amendment banning gay marriage is self-evidently ludicrous, and isn’t something the Congress should bother with. Hopefully sometime in the near future reason will win out.\n",
        "\tGender discrimination, although not as prevalent as it has been in the past, is still an issue in our society. In the past it was discrimination for very large issues, women were not allowed to vote, or hold a job. But there are also stereotypical beliefs held by both genders that are not completely extinct.\n\tWhen some men look at women all they see is “Suzie homemaker.” There is a stereotype of women that they belong in the kitchen, meant for nothing else then taking care of the house and the family. But this is not at all true. Women are just as capable as men to work and make money to support their families.\n\tHowever, there is discrimination in the workplace too. You have heard the story many times. A woman is at work and is not taken as seriously as the men that she works with. Even if she holds the same position as a male co-worker her education isn’t good enough, or her presentation couldn’t possibly be as good as a man’s work. Women have come such a long way. Although never faced with completely equal opportunities, our mothers and grandmothers took great strides in making life better for all women. It is now not unusual for women to work, as well as take care of a family. Women are powerful and can do anything they set their minds to. Women should be awarded all the same opportunities as men without restrictions.\n\tNot to be biased, men are faced with gender discriminations. Throughout history men have been referred to as the “bread winner” of the family, whose only job was to go to work and make the money. Taking care of family issues was not in the job description. However, times have changed. Now there are many men, who are referred to as “Mr. Mom”, taking care of the children, the housecleaning, and the family. Men as well as women can be in charge of these responsibilities. There shouldn’t be these stereotypes facing both genders that undermine what they want to do with their lives.\n\tMore then just work related stereotypes there are others facing both genders. Women are seen as the weaker gender, the gender that is not as capable as the men. Men are seen as the less emotional, less sensitive gender. Although in some cases these stereotypes are true, it is unfair to label all of one gender as having specific traits.\n\tSo what can we do about this problem? What can we do to change it? I don’t know if there is much we can do as an individual. For just one person to try and change discrimination would be a monumental task. But the power of a group is often underestimated. This is how women originally won the rights that they share now. Many women in the 1920’s were part of protests, picket lines, shouting “Votes for women.” They fought for their equal rights. The stereotypes we face now, although not a gigantic feat to overcome as winning the right to vote was, are still very important. Together if a group were to come together they would have a greater chance of getting something accomplished.\n",
        "\tMyspace, facebook, and many other online websites have sprung up all over the internet. There is not one person that I know that is not a member of at least one of these websites. They allow you to connect with people from all over the country, sharing common interests. Your profile consists of pictures, an about me section, maybe even a clip of your favorite song. Sounds great right?\n\tSometimes these websites aren’t all they are cracked up to be. How do we know that the person we are communicating with is really who they say we are? The truth is we don’t. When not using these websites to communicate with people we already know, anything can be said on the internet. You can put up and picture you want, and only right the most appealing stuff about yourself that everyone with access to a computer can see. That’s the real point, anyone with a computer can have an account, and anyone can create a profile under any alias they want. Your information is not safe.\n\tSo this leads to the problem of privacy rights. Recently a school was able to prevent a school shooting from information they received on myspace. Is this an invasion of privacy? \n\tI don’t think that the school violated any rights by looking at myspace. I can see both sides of the argument. The child thinks that it is his or her right and privacy to be able to have a profile on a website like myspace and not have to censor him/her. This is true, however it is not your right. The moment you enter something onto any website you are putting it out there for anyone to be able to see. The entire World Wide Web, with millions and millions of people from all over the country, now has access to the information you presented about yourself. The internet leaves little room for privacy rights. On certain websites there are privacy settings, allowing only certain people to view your information, censoring it from view to the public. But these rights can only go so far. What you need to remember is that everything that you do on the internet is subject to being seen by the entire world, if they know where to look for it.\n\tAs for the school preventing a shooting, this little tip from myspace saved what could have been a tragedy. The school was not wrong in receiving their information from this source. I don’t know if they were responding to a tip that someone gave them or not, but they probably were tipped off by someone. If you are going to put information like that on the internet, you need to be aware of the audience that could be viewing it. A bulletin on myspace is sent out to everyone who you are friends with.\n      I don’t think school officials should go searching myspace looking for a problem, but if information is presented to them, they have just as much of a right as anyone else with a computer to check up on it. In this case, the school was right in following their lead. This information prevented something terrible from happening.\n\n",
        "\tI absolutely do not think this example was an invasion of privacy.  For one, myspace is a public website, and anyone can access information there.  Just because a school official saw information about a school shooting does not mean that the subject’s privacy was breached.  How can one even argue that is was a violation of privacy rights?  What should this official have done – just ignore the threatening information because it might violate the privacy rights of someone planning a school shooting?  This issue is plain common sense.  When people are in danger, privacy rights – nearly all civil rights – take a back seat.\n\tThe bigger issue here is the distinction between right and wrong.  When you come right down to it, that is what all decisions in today’s world should be based on.  The benefit of saving innocent lives from a troubled teenager greatly outweigh the possibly  violating the privacy rights of an individual.  We should be so lucky as Americans that we are free in so many ways.  Maybe having so much freedom and so many rights is not always a good thing.  \n      When an official utilizes information to prevent violence, many people get offended.  In any other country, everyone would be thankful that a school shooting had been prevented.  Not America.  Americans and American lawyers are always looking to score some easy money by suing others for ridiculous reasons.  Maybe that is what this individual is trying to do – claiming that his privacy rights were violated in order to hide the real issue.  He was wrong and he got caught.  End of story.\n      “Privacy rights” is a very loose definition.  I think that people in this day and age are too sensitive.  These “violations” are meant to protect people, not hurt them.  What’s the big deal if the authorities adapt to your actions and catch you doing something wrong.  If you’re wrong to begin with, then you should be caught.  I support the Patriot Act because it is designed to protect people.  It is not designed to be a modern-day version of big brother.  If school shooters, or terrorists, or what have you, have learned to utilize the internet, it is a logical progression for the authorities to utilize it as well.  It’s evolution.  One side adapts, and the other side follows.\n      What are the negative consequences to law-abiding citizens?  In short, nothing.  If you aren’t doing illegal things, then you are safe.  If you are doing illegal things, then you aren’t safe.  Only positive things can come from the authorities looking for dangerous signals.  Just look at the results.  Lives were saved from a school shooting because someone acted on information.\n      I can see phone tapping as a controversial subject, but accessing information on the internet?  Please.  The internet is a public place and is designed for the easy access and sharing of information.  I can’t understand how someone would think someone’s privacy rights are more important than people’s lives.  This is an example of the backwards way of thinking of many people in the United States today.\n",
        "\tSince right after the attacks on our country on 9/11 we have been involved in a war. This war, the war in Iraq as it has been called, is fighting for a better life for those citizens of Iraq who have lived under control and in fear of the terrorist groups that reside there. For many of them, they had little hope until the United States showed up to help.\n\tThe war in Iraq has had its moments of ups and downs. Their have been times full of hope and times full of despair. We have lost a lot of men and women in Iraq, but we have also saved some lives; saved them from the terrible life they had been living.\n\tI believe that our forces are doing good things overseas. We have helped them to be freed from the evil forces that bound them, helped them to try to start over in finding a better life for their country. Many of Iraq’s people are no longer struggling in fear and a need to survive. There is hope for the people of Iraq now, no longer overcome by terrorist groups, this country has a chance. There is a chance for change, a chance for new beginnings. We have given them a new option, a new choice of freedom.\n\tI think that we need to stay overseas longer. For Iraq we have given them a strong starting point for which they can make a strong government off of, but our work is not done. Without our help I fear for what may happen to the citizens there. Will they be strong enough to stick to their new form, not to be taken under control as they were before? We have no way of completely knowing. We need to stand strong in Iraq continuing to fight, and to help them fight, for what we believe is best for them. Isn’t this what this war is all about?  Getting revenge for what we think is right, and helping other people. It is important to keep our goal in focus.\n      There are many conflicting views on this issue, which has led to many heated debates in our country. What do we do? Many feel as though it has gone on long enough, that we should get our men home and keep them safe. They feel that we are just risking more lives by staying there, that there is not much more we can do. But there is a lot that we can still do there. Many parts of Iraq have been destroyed in warfare, and many continue to be destroyed. Each day we hear more about what is going on overseas. From what I have heard the violence is not over. The United States needs to keep control in our hands. This is not a time to loosen our hold on the power. We have set Iraq up in the right direction, but without our guidance who knows where they could end up. It is important now to keep them heading in this direction. A direction towards the freedom and democracy that they deserve.\n",
        "\tThe internet has gotten out of control. With all of the “social networking utilities” such as Facebook, MySpace, BuddyPic, and the countless others, everyone’s identity is up for sale.  Actually, since all of the aforementioned websites are free to join, people don’t even have to steal your identity anymore – they can take it for free.  The public needs to be reminded constantly that anything you say on the internet as well as every single description of yourself you post on websites are a permanent, signed statement that can never be erased and will never be forgotten barring a nuclear explosion that wipes out every single server on the planet.  \n\tWhen I heard that school officials prevented a school shooting because one of the shooters posted a MySpace bulletin about it, I was overjoyed.  I do no consider that an invasion of privacy at all.  By definition, an “invasion” of privacy would imply that the school officials went above and beyond normal means to obtain private information about a student.  First of all, logging onto the internet and going to a website is not by any means going above and beyond normal means, and second of all any information on the internet that you don’t even need a password to access is by any means private!  School officials – especially the ones in charge of safety – not only shouldn’t be scorned for scanning these websites from time to time, but they should be encouraged to.  Police and other authorities scan these pages all the time to successfully help prevent child molesters, sexual predators and other various incarnations of stalkers from harming or abusing other people. \n\tNo line should be drawn when it comes to the internet.  People – even kids – should be informed appropriately so they know what they are getting into when they sign up and join websites such as Facebook, MySpace, BuddyPic, etc.  I am not calling for a Big Brother or 1984 style government spying on citizens; I am just calling for the citizens to have some common sense and to show some basic logical judgment.  If this is too much to ask for any specific person, then that person should not be allowed to even use a powerful tool such as a computer.  In some senses, one could argue that a computer with access to the internet can be more powerful and destructive than a car – ask anyone who has had their identity stolen or bank funds drained.  A license to use the internet may sound extreme, but I think it would not be completely illogical.\n\tAs a closing note, I would like to say that I myself am part of Facebook and MySpace.  I do not use these websites for any other purpose then to keep in touch with friends that I know in real life.  I have never and would never write or hold conversations on these utilities that I wouldn’t say loudly in a crowded room of strangers. Then again, I believe I have common sense.\n",
        "\tI am firm believer that the United States should have never embarked on any type of military intervention in Iraq.  I have always looked at war as a last resort.  If a genocide needs to be stopped, or a dictator needs to have his hand taken away from the nuclear button, then in certain situations war is the only logical outcome.  That being said I agreed with our involvement in WWII and I would have been in agreement with any military assistance we could have provided during the Rwandan genocide that the Caucasian world never lost sleep over.  But Iraq, Iraq to me was a country ruled by an iron fist dictator that we installed when it was politically correct to do so in the early 1980’s.  Before we knew it our little Seddam had emerged from his puppet role as foe to the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran was now himself the most feared dictator in the Middle East.  Our foreign policy mistake almost thirty years ago has not lead to not one but now two wars in Iraq, and perhaps even worse our occupation can now be seen as holding up the infrastructure of a nation divided. \n\tIt is tough for me as an American voter with liberal political ideologies to not feel lied to by our government.  We have perpetuated the colonialist ways of nation building though big corporations. Dick Chaney’s own company Halliburton is rebuilding the rubble that used to be called Iraq, furthermore, pip lines through Afghanistan and other Middle Eastern countries are still flowing as planned.  To me Iraq was a smoke screen that ended up accidentally blinding the ones using it for cover.  There were no weapons of mass destruction only a brutal dictator that we as a country have shared intimate ties with for decades.  We should be out of Iraq as soon as possible.  The casualties, the expenses, and the Iraqi people, all need to be taken into account at this point.  Iraq is more dangerous today than it has ever been, and now our great nation may be directly responsible for that. \t\n\tThis war has gone on longer than anyone had originally anticipated.  What was once a war backed by many UN involved countries is now a matter of US versus the world.  With Seddam in custody and literally all of his top officials dead or also captured Iraq should now have the means to begin to start over, without our help.  As long as we are involved with their elections and their economy, they will never be a free country.  Perhaps the new dictator of Iraq is George W. Bush.   \n",
        "\tCurrently, the issue of privacy has become a hot topic among people; there is one side that believes our privacy rights are being infringed upon, there are those that feel that we are being protected, and there are some that are not affected either way. In the issue of privacy concerning posts on myspace.com, I do not believe that the individual’s privacy rights were infringed upon.\n\tTo begin, the internet is not somewhere to post something an individual wants to keep private. The internet connects every person in the whole world; everyone has access to the internet twenty-four hours a day. The individual that posted a bulletin knew that other people would see this post. The individual may not have known that school officials would be looking, but it was there for the public. The school officials were looking out for the best interest of the school as a community. I believe that school officials should keep an eye on such “live posts” or “blogs” that appear on the internet. There are some people that cannot express themselves well, and will write something online that could indicate a problem of theirs. I would not call this incident an invasion of privacy. I would call this incident lucky, because the officials were able to prevent a tragic event that has affected many schools across the United States. \n\tI would consider something like this an invasion of privacy if it did not affect the school community. I do not believe that school officials should be intruding on the lives of their students. But students do have to realize that the internet is public- what they post can be seen by anyone; teachers, faculty, and school officials. My high school principle had a “myspace” page with plenty of students as his friends. Of course my principle had access to all of the student’s pictures, but he did not get a student in trouble for what he saw. The faculty heard stories in the hallways, they picked up notes, they saw pictures that were dropped, and they only intruded when necessary. The necessary was not most of the time. \n\tAn invasion of privacy cannot be considered an actual invasion if it is in the best interest of the people. I know that many people would disagree with this statement, especially with all the new practices since September 11th. If and only if my safety is the number one priority do I agree with these new security measures, but for no other reason. \n",
        "\tThe United States’ involvement with Iraq, otherwise known as “the Iraq War,” is a controversial debate within the United States which I support. There are many things that people look at as they judge the leader of the United States’ decisions. The fact that a great amount of Americans do not like President George W. Bush has a huge affect on how it appears that all Americans view the war. Throughout my teenage years, I have been a leader within Boy Scouts. I know from experience that a leader can not go anywhere without the support of his people. I have made mistakes as a leader within Scouts, but these mistakes could have been solved easier if my “followers” would have cooperated with me. I feel as though President Bush is in the same position that I was in back then. It is true that he is not the United States’ best, smartest, etc. President, but he is our leader, and America needs to respect that. I believe strongly that if a leader is believed in by his/her people, he/she can do many great things. I support the war in Iraq due to my steadfast faith in our country’s leader, President Bush.\n\n\tAs I was surfing the internet on www.facebook.com, I found a group entitled “Thank God for Bush.” This group supported President Bush because he is our leader. I noticed that this group turned into a debate site about the war in Iraq which Bush is leading. Many people posted on the “wall” of the site their disbelief in the war, and their opinions on why it is pointless. In opposition to the protestors, one person posted on the wall a story of a child asking his father and mother, who were both soldiers, why the U.S. was at war. The father took the son to his window and told him to look outside and imagine that each yard in the neighborhood was a different country. Pretending that their yard was the United States and the boy was President Bush, the Father told his son to look out of the window and imagine that the man across the street was Sadaam Hussein. The father then told the boy to imagine that the man was throwing his family outside and beat them to death. The little boy wanted to call the police (U.N. in this case), but they would not help. As the man walked across the street to burn down the house of an elderly lady, he looked the boy straight in the eye. No one would help the boy when he wanted to get help, so the man across the street eventually ended up at the boy’s doorstep- stronger than ever. The point of this story, the father told his son, was that if he had stopped “Sadaam” before any of this happened he would’ve prevented all of the casualties. This story touched me and inspired me even further in my support for President Bush and his efforts in Iraq.\n\n\tAfter reading this moving story, all of my thoughts and feelings on the Iraq War became stronger. I knew that there is no point in starting something and not finishing it, especially something as serious as a war. As the story put the situation in the Middle East to perspective for me so that I could look at the world as though it was a neighborhood, I realized that all countries should look out for one another- no matter what the name of a country is. People should not only look out for specific countries, but instead look out for the benefit of all mankind. Everyone in this world should support all other humans, if their intentions are good. The United States’ war in Iraq has everything except bad intentions which is why I believe that Americans should believe in the United States’ efforts in the Middle East.\n#29\n\n",
        "      The right to marry whoever one pleases is no more outrageous than freedom of speech, or the right to a fair trial, which are granted freely in the Bill of Rights.  Since the right to marry whoever one pleases is not explicitly stated as an American’s right, many people try to deny its existence.  In many cases, there is no controversy surrounding who a person chooses to marry.  When a woman chooses a man to spend her life with, she will meet no opposition from the government or political activists.  The same is true for a man who chooses a woman to marry.  When a woman chooses woman, however, or a man a man, the controversy surrounding the issue of marriage becomes much more pronounced.  All of a sudden, the union of two people which we call marriage is not as easily accepted by society.  Only in cases of homosexual marriages does the government wish to have a say in who can marry who.  This is not a proper place for the government to be in control, because it only becomes involved when it deems a marriage problematic, that is, when it is between two people of the same sex.\n\tNot only should the government step down from the issue of gay marriage, but the American people need to learn to be more tolerant of others.  Two of the main problems that people have with gay marriage are that they think it is contrary to the Bible, or it seems something they themselves would never want to participate in.  For those who oppose gay marriage because the Bible describes marriage in a traditional male-female sense, they need to remember that the Bible is to be interpreted, not read as law.  It is impossible to follow every facet of Biblical teaching, and as long as a gay marriage follows the rules of respect and exchange detailed in the Bible, then it is not contrary to Biblical teachings, just a different scriptural interpretation.  For those who oppose gay marriage because they themselves have no interest in ever being married to a person of the same sex, they need to learn that what is right for one person may be wrong for another.  Everybody is different and it is important to embrace these differences instead of forcing conformity to a set of rules that does not work for everyone.  Flexibility is the best way to please all.\n\tChoosing who to spend the rest of one’s life with is a big commitment, and anyone who decides to join themselves in the union of marriage to another human being should be allowed to do so legally by marriage.  People should be more tolerant and accepting of others, and realize that gay marriage is not hurting anyone, but only making people happy by giving them the opportunity to spend their lives with the people they love, united as one through the ritual of marriage.  There is really no reason to be opposed to people’s happiness, and therefore, no reason to be opposed to gay marriage, as for many people, happiness can be found through the possibility of gay marriage.\n",
        "\tIn the recent cited event where police officers were able to stop a school shooting because of information on myspace I believe they were correct in their actions.  First and foremost, the law enforcers of this country have a duty to protect all citizens and uphold the law.  With that in mind, I feel their actions were motivated by this cause and none other.  They did have to cross so-called “privacy boundaries” to do this, however, the issue of privacy in this case is irrelevant.  \n\tAny of the major facilitators (Facebook, myspace, etc…) of personal information on the World Wide Web these days make the information fairly public to a large number of people; the users merely need, at most, a password and username.  Sometimes those two pieces of information are not even required, as in the case of myspace.  So if there is no restriction or attempt to protect the community of users with some sort of agreement or set of log-in standards, it is unreasonable to call the information on the myspace wall private.  If the information is that easy to obtain, there are not any privacy attributions associated with it.  \n\tIn a moral debate about what is more important to society, privacy or human life, it is still hard to uphold the fact that privacy comes first and should be respected.  When it boils down to the fundamental nature of human society, life is invaluable and should be preserved at all costs.  The fact that people would revolt against law enforcement’s “improper” use of information when it saved potentially many innocent lives is nothing less than appalling.\n\tHad the specific situation described, or any other situation for that matter, gone through and progressed according to plan the general consensus would probably be to support the use of private information.  I think without the reality of information’s effect on other people, one would tend to favor a more theoretical argument, such as privacy rights in this situation.  If school shootings were to occur, however, the general reasoning would probably change to consent to usage of private information in the case where human harm can be prevented.  \n\tThe idea of privacy rights in the case of myspace pertains to information that is available to the general population on the World Wide Web.  With such easy and unhindered access to the information, it is hard to maintain a case for privacy rights when the sole purpose is to share your information with others.  Again, it is especially hard to maintain the case for privacy rights when that information contains threats to human safety.  The real issues that may stem from the idea of privacy rights on the World Wide Web are rights in other aspects of life:  phone conversations, personal credit information, and personal physical property among many others.\n\tIn my mind privacy rights become a much larger issue, especially recently where the government has been acting controversially to inspect possible homeland security issues, when the information is not generally available to the public or is not meant to be generally available to the public.  When phones are being tapped or personal correspondences are being intercepted where communication is meant to exist privately between small groups of people, privacy rights are being broken in my opinion.  \n\n",
        "Subject Number 15:\n\n2. GAY MARRIAGE:  While some states have legalized gay marriage, others are still opposed to it.  Do you think either side is right or wrong?  Why?  How do you feel about President Bush’s push for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage?  Should the federal government be involved in this issue?\n\n\n\tI do not think that the president should be allowed to even propose such an idea as banning gay marriage. I understand that he is a Christian, and that in the eyes of Christianity, gay marriage can not happen, which I agree with, being a Christian. However, I do feel that there are some things that can be addressed that would satisfy both desires of both groups of people. \n\tFirst off, I agree that there should be no such thing as gay marriage. Marriage is by definition between a man and a women (in the Bible) who can then produce offspring and raise a family if they so choose in the eyes of the Lord. For other religions too, it would be to raise their offspring in the eyes of whoever that head of the religious sect is. However, with same sex marriages, there is no possibility for the production of offspring, and thus the population would die out and there is no one to teach the religion to. \n\tI feel that if those of the same sex wish to get married, then it should be called something other then a marriage, because it is not ever able to be a full marriage as seen in the eyes of God. However, by calling it something else, other then the term Civil Union, which is also used for heterosexual couples, they can gain the same feeling of respect and trust as marriages seen though the eyes of the church. \n\tInsurance companies would be able to recognize them, and so would the government for tax purposes. They would be able to gain all of the governmental benefits as normal families (in the fact that it is a man and a women) are able to obtain. I believe that those people of the same sex should be able to partake in some sort of ceremony to solidify their union, and make it seem more personal. \n\tI do not however think that the government should be able to gain any say into the situation after it has been established that they are able to \"wed\" for lack of a better term. Other then the initial name and word usage approved by the federal government, they should not be able to tell which states allow it and which ones do not. The state governments should not be allowed to do the same either, because then that would be a form of discrimination. \n\tI do not think that there should be an amendment added to the Constitution either, because to marry or to have a union between the same sex is a personal matter. Personal choices should not be paraded around on a Constitution, so President Bush should not be able to ban personal choices. Our country is based off of freedom, and not purely rules and regulation. If it were then we would not be a free country. The constitution is about giving guidelines for our country to follow, not telling us what to do or not do at every point and turn of our lives.  \n",
        "      The debate over gay marriage is one of the most hot-button issues in today’s political discussions.  The underlying question is what defines marriage?  Is it simply a committed relationship between two people, or specifically between a man and a woman?  Massachusetts grants gay couples the right to marry.  Vermont allows them to enter into “civil unions”, and New Jersey is still deciding whether the acknowledgement of a gay couple should be referred to as marriage or simply civil union.  While I have not yet completely formed my own opinion about gay marriage, I do not believe that there should be a constitutional amendment banning it.  There are so many different definitions of family in today’s society that I wonder if it’s really right or even necessary to ban one specifically.  Furthermore, laws concerning marriage have typically been the responsibility of the individual states.  I do not see any need to change that policy.\n      Marriage as an institution that has taken quite a beating in the last few decades.  The divorce rate rises each year, and it is becoming more of a rarity to find two people in a loving, committed, and faithful relationship raising children together.  Since at least half of heterosexual couples seem to fail at this, why not allow gay couples the chance to succeed?  \n      There is also a great deal of legal questions to consider.  According to most laws in place now, gay people are not allowed spousal confidentiality during a trial.  This is only one example of the disadvantages that gay couples within the regulations of the legal system. \n      I can’t help but wonder if the opposition to gay marriage is merely a reincarnation of feelings that prompted people to oppose interracial marriages not too long ago.  There used to be very strict laws against white people marrying African Americans.  Even in the 1980’s, when my Caucasian aunt married a black man, they were not accepted at first by all the members of my family.  Today people view these laws as discriminatory and unjust.  Will the next generation view our laws against gay marriage as discriminatory and unjust?\n      The real question then is what takes significance, sex or love?  If two people love each other, if they want to be recognized as part of a committed relationship in the eyes of the state, to receive the same benefits as any married heterosexual couple, then I believe that they should be allowed this.  Of course family life is another important factor to consider.  Is it better for a child to grow up in home broken by heterosexual divorce, or a home warmed by the love of a gay couple?  True, children of homosexual couples may be ridiculed by their peers, but so were mulatto children decades ago.  After fighting one kind of prejudice for so many years, how can we so easily succumb to another one?\n      I believe that I have, through the course of this essay, convinced myself that marriage is a right that belongs to homosexuals as much as it does to heterosexuals.  There should be no national amendment banning it.  State by state, I believe people will come to accept gay couples, just as state by state, people began to lift laws against interracial marriage.\n      \n      \n      \n",
        "\tQuestions about privacy usually boil down to the reconciliation of individual rights with collective security.  Whether we are talking about high school safety or national security, the same fundamental questions persist – how might we preserve privacy, yet also preserve the safety of our environment?  What level of intrusion is appropriate for, on one hand, the apprehension of potentially dangerous criminals, yet on the other hand, the preservation of personal privacy?\n\tFrom town police (who identify potential school shooters on MySpace) right on up to federal law enforcement agencies (who, under recent congressional provisions, record our phone calls without court warrant), the American political system is grappling with this question presently.\n\tThe problem I can most plainly identify is one of subversive government conduct.  I am struggling to accept that my country, which I love, has executive agencies who, to the end of national security, justify means like waterboarding.  I was made to memorize certain rhetoric about the foundation of my “American” culture in elementary school; namely about how my country’s respect for individual freedom is unparalleled throughout history.  I thoroughly believed this for a long time.  I am/was proud to say that my grandfather fought, and almost gave his life, for these ideals in World War II.  I see a fundamental contradiction between freedom, which he fought for, and torture.  Seeing this contradiction does not make me “unpatriotic”.  I just want to know, is there a great American “underbelly” which we, the general public, are not privy to?\n\tAre we really so paranoid that subversive measures are necessary? I quickly got over the issue of wiretapping – as it didn’t really affect me.  However, I’m beginning to think that wiretapping is just the issue of the iceberg.\n\tLet’s say, hypothetically, that an extension of our executive intelligence branch, like the NSA, offered unsuspecting college student-citizens a gratuitous amount of money to submit treatises on their political views.  This organization might solicit responses about hot-button political issues which directly affect it, such as the Iraq war effort and wiretapping.\n      Let’s say participating citizens then weren’t at all informed about the source of their enumeration.  Hypothetically, it might be called a “study about the way people communicate”.  If it were truly a study about how people communicate, wouldn’t the organization would be forthcoming and inform all participants of exactly *what* they were getting themselves into?  Citizens with nothing to hide need not worry about wiretapping, right?  Reflexively, shouldn’t agencies with nothing to hide be more forthcoming as well?\n      I had to ask lots and lots of questions to figure out exactly who was funding this study, and when I finally figured it out, it made a lot of sense.\n      I’m not sure exactly why this study is happening, or why my peers and I are being asked to submit these essays on privacy, Iraq, marijuana, gender rights, or other hot button issues.  We are being paid gratuitous amounts of money to do so, which is nice.  I suppose I’ll just think of it as an extension of my income tax refund.  \n      I don’t want to jump to ridiculous “conspiracy theory” conclusions about this study, but it is quite easy to do so.  I had to ask many pointed questions to figure out who is funding this study and where these essays are going.  Once I found out, I sort of sat in denial for a while.  It seems odd that, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, essays like this one will be categorized by NSA data analysts.  Are you looking for subversive citizens?  Or are you just trying to find potential candidates for employment?  I can’t possibly see how this could actually be a study about “how people communicate”, of all the motives which could drive this study, that seems among the least likely/least feasible.\n      If anyone wants to get in touch with me and explain all these details, that would be great.  But I know it will probably never happen.  Supposedly, this essay will not even be tied to my identity (sure, like that’s believable).  I do not mean to sound so vindictive, but as I sat down to write this essay, I started drowning in irony:  I was asked to write an essay on privacy, and the very circumstances under which I was asked could be construed to be an invasion of the same.\n      So don’t peg me for a terrorist or label me a threat to society, because honestly, that would just be silly modern McCarthyism.  I’m a concerned, informed, patriotic, home-loving American.  If it ever really came down to it, I’d absolutely fight for my country.  But I am not stupid, and I take notice of ALL my surroundings with great care and detail.  When things don’t add up, red flags start flying.\n",
        "\tOnce again, we come to an issue that many people have strong feelings on. In my previous response through the email, I believe that I had a different opinion from the one that I have now. Gay marriage is an issue that should have a 100% overall agreement. I do not believe either side is wrong in their beliefs. We are in the 20th century- times have changed and people should be more accepting of the changes in sexuality. As for President Bush’s push for an amendment to ban gay marriage, I do not agree. \n\tStudies may differ, but with others knowledge and with the information presented to me, I feel that genetics is the cause for a person to be homosexual and not heterosexual. I do not feel that it is due to a person’s environment, or they way they were brought up. This type of sexuality has existed all the way back to the time of our creation. It has always been there, people just decided to avoid the subject. I do not agree with the federal government trying to intervene in a person’s private life, especially if they are trying to decide who an individual can marry- it is ridiculous to even think about!\n\tMarriage was created to bring together a man and a woman; rules have been bent for other issues less important than gay marriage. Why are people so afraid of this change? I know I am uneasy of the idea, but I have to accept it, because we can not change a person’s genetics or who they are attracted to. The ancient philosopher Plato, described humans as beings searching for their other half. He described the original humans as beings in the shape of a ball with two pairs of sexual organs. One ball had two male organs, one ball had two female organs, and the other ball had one male organ and one female organ. When the gods feared the power of humans, Zeus split them in half; they wandered the world searching for their other half. This is how love is described, the search for our soul mate, and the search for the deep connection that we cannot describe. \n\tThe side opposing gay marriage is not wrong, they believe they are acting for the good of the people, but how do they know what is good for these people different from them. The federal government is not needed for this issue; they have greater things to worry about, and marriage is not one of them. \n",
        "\tThe Catholic Church is a very conservative and regressive organization when compared to other organizations and religions throughout the world.  They have an attitude of acting the way they want to act – disregarding the opinions of others, even those within the Church.  In today’s modern world the Church still has an empire of sorts.  Vatican City is but a shadow of the Holy Roman Empire, but it still shows that the Church is interested in temporal power, instead of just focusing on spirituality.  \n      The pope is supposed to be the leader of the Church.  I see the pope as a way for the Catholic Church to proclaim infallibility in all of its doctrines and teachings.  The pope is no better than any man off the street.  Why should he be the “voice of God on earth?”  I disagree with the highly structured organization of personnel the Church has come up with.  What power have priests been given that they can administer God’s forgiveness?  I believe each person should bypass the middleman/priest and converse directly with God.  The Church would not have this, however, because it would mean that they would have to amend some of their practices.\n      That’s one thing that the Church very rarely does.  They don’t like to admit that they’re wrong, because that would jeopardize everything they have proclaimed over the years.  Take their stance on homosexuality, for example.  They actually believe, in this day and age, that being gay is a sin.  This is why the Church needs to adapt to life in the 21st century.  Being gay is biological – it is not a result of the person in question choosing to be gay.  And so what if that person did choose to be gay?  People are different, so let them be the way they are without trying to say that God doesn’t approve.  This is just one example of how the Catholic Church breeds exclusivity.  \n      The Church refuses to modernize, even when science has made such great strides.  Scientists now have the capability to utilize embryonic stem cells to quite possibly cure some of the most deadly diseases.  It is ridiculous that the Church would say that scientists should not pursue embryonic stem cell research because it is “immoral.”  Who is the Church to decide what is and is not moral?  Oh, that’s right, God tells them everything that’s right and wrong in this world.\n      I still can’t figure out why Catholic priests aren’t allowed to marry.  It makes no economic sense to force the priests to be celibate.  In doing so, the undoubtedly reduce the amount of people who become priests.  I mean, how many people would willingly throw away their sex lives for some far-fetched explanation?  Not many, as the Church is figuring out.\n      I do think that the pedophilia scandal could have been prevented if priests were allowed to have sex.  It’s a fact of humanity that all people have sexual desires, and when outlets for those desires are stripped away, the priests turn to the easiest way around the restrictions.  It is the fault of the Church’s unwillingness to change that so many young boys were molested.  I’m not absolving the priests, but I guess they were kinda backed into a corner by the Catholic Church.\n",
        "      The war in Iraq is arguably the central focus of the United States’ foreign policy.  The government is expending many resources, including large sums of money and thousands of troops, for the sake of winning the Iraqi war.  The fact that the US is involved in this war influences the life of every single US citizen, and naturally, has been a cause of contention.  A person’s views on the war in Iraq can quickly associate him or her with a political party, because the war is so critical to American politics.  The war in Iraq is a major focus of American attention, and opinions on the United States’ role in it vary widely.  \n\tI feel that the United States is not making enough headway in its mission to continue the war in Iraq.  The majority of this problem stems from the fact that the United States’ mission in Iraq is unclearly defined.  It is easy to suggest possible goals, but the government has not done a good job of explicitly identifying the nation’s purpose in Iraq.  Daily, citizens like me wonder why the US government is so adamant about maintaining occupation of Iraq.  What is the government hoping to gain and accomplish?  If the American people had a clear, justified answer to this question, it would be much easier to support the war effort.  As it is, however, I cannot help but be opposed to something whose motive is so disguised.\n\tWithout a clear sense of the war’s purpose, the war just seems destructively harmful and excessive.  The United States puts so many resources into the war, and seems really invested in their cause, whatever it may be exactly.  Without knowing this cause, it seems wasteful to expend resources in such a manner, and even worse, to think of the lives that are being adversely affected because of the Iraqi war.  American soldiers are constantly being sent out to serve in Iraq, and many of them do not make it home alive.  Others return injured, or at the very best, physically healthy but having had endured the awful tragedy of war and destruction.  War undoubtedly takes a toll on the American people, not to mention on the Iraqi people.  Destruction and death are common problems in a nation at war, especially when the war is fought on the nation’s home territory, as is the case for the Iraqi people.  The presence of United States’ forces in Iraq only worsens the quality of life for the Iraqi people, to the point where they are living in constant fear of death and endangerment.\n\tThe detriments of the war in Iraq, for the US itself and for the Iraqi people are hard to justify without a clearly defined role and purpose of the United States in the war.  For this reason, the best course of action is to end the action in Iraq, for the war has gone on long enough, and it is time to replace destruction and death with peace and well-being.\n",
        "Participant #14 Essay #5 – Catholic Church\n\tLuckily, I have experienced life up until my college life with minimal to no influence from the Catholic Church.  My father is a minister in a small denomination of Christianity referred to as the Church of the Brethren, which is a completely different view of Christianity than Catholicism.  If I still retained my beliefs in religion or God that I did until about high school, my father’s church is most definitely the church I would stick with.  It’s a church that altogether practices much more to the example of Jesus Christ than Catholicism, which seems to me more like charades and motions then actual spirituality.  The Church of the Brethren is also historically a peace church and a church that stresses simple living (so that others may “simply live,” as their motto goes), most truly to Jesus’ example.  However, over the years I have been more than disillusioned to religion, and hold a different stance denying the need for religion altogether.  Personally, I feel that if one does believe in a higher power, one does not need a religion to hold a personal relationship with this higher power, and what is a church then, other than a series of rituals and “incantations” that just denies the ability of humans to individually know and love their God?  Surely, the morality of religion is necessary, but that this morality must be explained as rules from a higher power that must be followed in order to ensure our place in a decent afterlife seems unnecessary.\n\tHowever I may view the necessity of religion, while religion is here to stay I don’t view it as an evil at all.  In fact, I think that for a majority of people, religion has been helpful and I don’t feel the need at all to abolish it.  While I might not like the concept, I am entirely open to letting whoever wants to try religion out for size a fair chance.  Toleration and freedom of religion are very important to me, and just as I allow homosexuals, women and minorities the same rights, I allow freedom of religion.  Now while all the may seem like a tangential dissertation on religion in general and not entirely related to the question, this is my very point.  Do I think the Catholic Church needs to change?  Absolutely not.  If the church changed the opinions it has held for the last couple thousands of years, then it wouldn’t be the same church.  That’s why we have freedom of religion.  If the Catholics changed their beliefs then they would be Lutherans, or Protestants, or Calvinists.  If one does not agree with the religion of which they are currently a member, then they can find a church that agrees with their morals.  The only problem I have is that so many Catholics believe that Catholicism is the only way to get saved.  When asked about Christianity, almost every Catholic I know refers to Christianity and Catholicism synonymously.  It seems as if the bishops and the pope believe they are simply better than other denominations.  While certainly each denomination believes it is the best and truest form, most other denominations I have witnessed believe in cooperation because their disagreements are minor.  However, it seems to me like Catholics don’t even consider other churches as valid, so if I would change anything, that would be it.\n\n",
        "\tIt is a silly question to ask if gender discrimination still exists.  No offense to the creator of the question, but it is really self-evident.  One cannot ask if a certain mindset exists, whether it is one of good or evil, because it always will.  The world will never be rid of any state of mind, any hatred, any prejudice, because somewhere someone will always hold every mindset and belief.  The world is just too damn big to think that something such as discrimination, whether it is religious, sexist, racist, or whatever, will ever not exist.  There will always be bigots.  In this way, there is nothing we can do to end gender discrimination.  We can work to diminish it, but it will unfortunately always exist.  So on that note, does it still exist in the workplace?  Certainly.  If it exists in the mindset of employers, then it exists in the workplace.  Now we must take a second here to draw a distinction, because there are obviously situations where discrimination is necessary.  After all, discrimination at a basic level means no more than the ability to distinguish between two things.  That being said, there are certain jobs where an employer needs to pick a man over a woman, or a woman over a man.  If a job involves heavy lifting, an employer is always going to pick a man over a woman, unless the woman used to be a professional weight lifter.  This is not a bad form of discrimination: being able to make distinctions between what a woman’s capabilities are and what a man’s capabilities are is a necessary part of being an employer.  The only cases we are looking at are when a woman and a man are equally qualified to hold a certain position, and the employer chooses solely on gender, or perhaps when the gender not chosen for the position is better qualified and the other sex wins solely on gender.  Even this is very hard to call, because all choices are opinions and perspectives anyway.  What may seem like a case of gender discrimination to one person may have actually been a judgment call based on personality on the part of the employer.  It is very hard to come out and call something discrimination because the discrimination only exists in the mind of the employer.  The employer will never come out directly and say, “I pick you for the job because you are a man and I don’t want a woman working here.”  So what can be done about this problem?  Nothing, really.  How can one expect to change how people think?  Should we try some sort of affirmative action for females?  Absolutely not.  First of all, it’s not really working for minorities, so why should it work for women?  And second of all, won’t this just give women an unfair advantage?  There is really no way to ensure perfect equality as far as job opportunities go.  All we can do is set standards for what we expect out of our employers, and hope for the best.\n\n",
        "\tThe opinion of people who want the Catholic Church to change according to life in the twenty first century is absolute absurdity. The Catholic Church has always been a target for criticism ever since Martin Luther, or even before him. The media currently loves to focus their attention on the Catholic Church, and all of its faults. It is most likely that everything the Catholic Church is facing is also happening in other religions, such as pedophilia, etc. If one selfishly changes a religion because he/she does not agree wholly with the views, then that person is not dedicated enough to that religion. If a religion is changed, then it is not that religion at all. Therefore, if the Catholic Church changes its ways to accommodate the twenty first century, it wouldn’t be the Catholic Church anymore.\n\n\tThere is always a reason for everything within Christianity. A female can not become a priest because the religion specifically said that they can not. The option of becoming a nun was created for women if they wanted to become that committed in the religion. Another ridiculous change would be to allow priests to marry. The priests can not marry, because all of their love is devoted to God. These things are parts of the Catholic religion, and will always be a part of it. Most people who want the Church to change aren’t even Catholic, or are selfish enough to solely stay away from church because they don’t agree with one thing. Normally this “thing” is sex before wedlock. If one stays away from the church because of that, then they should re-evaluate their faith. It is like if a man loves a woman who has a shaved head. If he truly loves her, then the male will stay with the woman. If the man tells the woman to grow hair with the threat of leaving her, then did he actually love her? The answer is no, the man was too selfish to stay with the “love” of his life. Even though the hair would have made her perfect for him, he took his selfish ways instead of his dedication.\n\n\tJust because the media only focuses on the Catholic Church does not mean that the pedophilia does not occur in other religions. The media is one of the only reasons that people dislike the Catholic Church. Every few weeks it seems as though there is another case on a Priest who has committed a crime, or the Pope who has done something debatable. I have noticed that those stories make headlines, whereas if an important person in another religion does something of the sort, it is not magnified as much. If these exaggerations of the Catholic Church’s “mistakes” cause people to form the opinion that the Church needs to change, then they should form another religion similar to the Catholic Church. This, of course, would not be a “true” religion because of the fact that it was not created as a result of some magnificent occurrence. The example for the Catholic Church is that Jesus came down to help everyone on earth. What basis would this reformed version of Catholicism have? The new religion by itself would not have anything to base itself upon other than the religion of Catholicism (a true religion) - not an occurrence, etc.. Changing the Catholic Church to suit modern wants is ridiculous due to the fact that a religion is not its true self unless its followers believe what they were intended to follow. \n",
        "\tOf course gender discrimination is still an issue. It would be ludicrous to expect that a society born and bred on millennia of European paternalistic social modes would shed them in under a century. The problem is that examples of discrimination have become harder to recognize; it’s no longer kosher to avoid promoting a female worker or to make overt and unwelcome sexual comments to them (not to say that this doesn’t happen). Gender discrimination has just become a deeply imbedded part of life, instead of a more visible one.\n\tOne could argue that the reason there aren’t as many females in high-level corporate or political roles is that there aren’t many clamoring for the positions. There is some truth to this, at least in the political realm; there simply aren’t as many female candidates as there are males. But a more truthful outlook asks another question: why not? Despite the advances made by the feminist movement, we still live in a society in which a female’s role is predetermined to involve child-rearing and, to some extent, housekeeping, although I think the latter has shifted a fair amount within the last quarter-century. More women are leaving their homes for the workplace, but this is often greeted with a kind of lukewarm encouragement from certain portions of the political and social spectrum, and sometimes snarling discouragement (anyone remember Rick Santorum’s remarks to this effect? We should all be thankful that he’s out of a job now). In the eyes of many people, the equality between genders exists in name only. For example, ponder whether or not the government will consider reinstating the draft anytime soon. Answer: nope. They’d have to wrestle with the question of whether to draft women, and no politician wants to touch that issue with a thirty-nine and a half foot pole.\n\tOn the flipside, men sometimes receive backlash from the phenomena known as “reverse discrimination.” It occasionally happens that the perceived need to promote female employees on the part of managers and otherwise could result in qualified males being ignored. Much the same argument is made in regards to race. While I don’t have statistics sitting here in front of me, I can’t imagine that this would be a large portion of the working male population though, and probably actually involves very few (think “the fingers on my two hands”).\n\tWhat we do about gender discrimination is a complicated question. There are a lot of possible answers. First should be our language, I think. It sounds absurd, but male-oriented linguistic formations help shape the way we understand and order reality. Here’s a smattering of examples: the ubiquitous use of phrase such as “mankind” or “man” to describe all of humanity, the preference for male pronouns when referring to non-specific persons or person in hypothetical situations, and the bizarre attribution of female gender to thoroughly unsexed objects (ships, for example). Another route to go is the old tried ‘n true method of education. People need to be taught about gender differences and similarities so that they don’t go around building absurd notions based upon faulty foundations. This won’t take care of the issue, but it won’t take care of itself, either.\n",
        "\tThe Catholic Church should adapt to life in the 21st Century with some very important and worthwhile changes.  While it is hard to make changes to traditions that seem as permanent as Catholicism itself, there would be many advantages to adopting certain new practices.  For example, with regards to pedophilia amongst priests, if the Catholic Church allowed priests to marry, this would greatly lessen the amount of pedophilic incidents.  Also, since the Church is experiencing a continuous shortage of priests, allowing females priestesses would help solve this problem.\n\tEven though the Church could use many changes in our modern times, this does not lessen the massive amount of good the Church bestows on our world.  It is unfair for the media to expound the pedophilia within the Church when, really, it only occurred amongst a very low number of priests.  There is no doubt that pedophilia is a sickening crime that should be fought at every turn.  Nevertheless, there are thousands of good, innocent men out there who have contributed their lives to God for noble causes, and it is wrong to undermine the efforts of these men and lessen our view of the Catholic Church in general.\n",
        "\tI am a member of the facebook.com.  For me it has been an open forum for meeting friends at my school, getting in tough with old high school friends, and of course maybe grabbing a screen name or a phone number of the cute girl that sits next to me in class.  However, last year one of my friends was suspended for one game of his lacrosse season because in one of his facebook pictures he was holding a beer and he is not of the age.  How did he get in trouble?  Our athletic director has a facebook account under some fake name and decided to check my friend’s pictures.  This is an invasion of privacy on multiple levels.  First of all he is using a false identity to look at pictures of college students he knows performing illegal deeds after the fact.  The police couldn’t even have arrested my friend for drinking but our AD can suspend him.  Moreover, where is the line to be drawn?  Our lives are already monitored to a heartbeat here at Loyola, we are given luxurious apartments along with freedom from our parents for the first time in our lives, and then immediately reprimanded by RA’s and prick resident directors for entertaining the idea of beer before we are 21.  \n\tThat all being said I am in favor of finding out about a bomb threat through myspace.com.  As far as I am concerned if it saves lives it is alright by me.  That doesn’t mean I want my house to be wire tapped.  But if I had written on my front lawn that I am going to bomb a building than it would be ok to do some fly by surveillance.  Our government’s role is to protect and to serve its citizens, not to be overbearing and intrusive.  It is my belief that our president should have been impeached for his role in the wire tapping of certain American citizens following the terror attacks on 9/11.  It is just sad that our privacy had to be impinged upon as retaliation for our government not being informed enough about the acts that lead up to 9/11.  \n\tIn our schools, privacy should be permitted to a certain degree where a principals or a deans discretion being used to make final decisions.  Lockers and emails should be accessible for investigation if need be, but under no circumstances should our phone conversations be recorded.  Myspace and facebook transcend both phone and email conversations.  They are open forums for freedom of speech for my generation.  \n",
        "      Gender discrimination will always exist for the same reason any discrimination will always exist – people are different.  If someone is different from everybody else, that is an easy and obvious target for another person to put them down, regardless of what motivates the bully.  That being said, I believe that gender discrimination has come a long way in the past few decades.  Through the Women’s Rights movement and other similar activism, I think certain people have succeeded in convincing the American public as a whole treat everyone a little more fairly.  All that anyone can ask is that people be treated with respect in public, no matter what private opinions people hold.  So, while there will never be a complete eradication of gender discrimination in America, we are on the right track to making everyone treat each other with the most respect possible.\n      Women hold the short end of the stick as far as gender discrimination is concerned.  This is because the man has held a higher social status throughout history.  Even if we look back as recent as the early 1900’s, men were primarily the head of the household, holding the higher paying job.  Women were considered the homemakers, and if they even had a job at all their professions were limited to short list, such as teachers or nurses.  After the World Wars, when the men were sent off to war, women started to fill in for the positions that up until then were reserved for men.  This probably had a lot to do with women gaining more respect as a demographic, because it proved that most of the jobs done by men could also be done by women as well.  In present day, women have just as good a chance at getting a job as men do applying for the same position. However, there still remain fields of work that are statistically held primarily by men, such as engineering and some of the other fields of science.  This may be because women simply aren’t attracted to those jobs as much as they are to other jobs.  Whatever the cause, the lack of female employees in these lines of work still leave the door wide open for discrimination.  For example, since there are not many women scientists, one could make the faulty correlation that women don’t excel at subjects such as math or science as men do. Since there will never be an exact 50/50 ratio of men and women at all jobs, this type of reasoning for gender discrimination will always exist to some point.\n      Men can be discriminated against in the workplace to a lesser degree, but for different reasons.  As mentioned before, some occupations were classically held by women.  When men start to apply and work at these jobs, they can be viewed as feminine.  American culture as a whole unfortunately still holds the belief that men should be manly and macho.  Therefore, men who hold these jobs are open to a different brand of gender discrimination.\n      \n",
        "\tI can’t see any way at all in which school officials circumventing a dangerous situation by reading a student’s Myspace would be an invasion of privacy.  Any information posted on the internet is meant for others to read- otherwise, why put it up?  Information made public in any way, like in a note passed around or posted on a blog, should no longer have privacy rights attached to it.\n\tIf this were a case like the one in which a girl’s purse was subjected to search by school officials because she was suspected of possessing marijuana, it might be different.  A purse is by definition private property (someone owns it), the internet is not.  This is especially true because the entire purpose of Myspace is to share personal information with your friends and other users.  The information on your “personal site” is constantly subject to review and censorship by the creators of Myspace, which they tell you on registration, so there is no real expectation of privacy.  In fact, many schools warn their students that they search student Myspaces and Facebooks.\n\tEven a personal site not on a host like Myspace or Facebook can’t be considered private property unless it is specifically made unavailable to everyone except a certain group of people.  Anyone can get a Myspace, and anyone can look at most personal sites.  It is a school’s right to look at the same personal information that is available to millions of people all over the world with a click of a button - people such as stalkers and child molestors!  If a person has no problem with potentially dangerous people seeing such personal information, then he or she really has no call to pick and choose who has a right to look and who doesn’t.\n\tPosting a bulletin on Myspace that says you are going to shoot up your school is akin to writing it on the bathroom wall and signing it (you can’t post an anonymous bulletin).  You can’t guarantee which of your friends will use that bathroom and see it and you can’t guarantee that no teachers will wander in and read it as well.  I would have more of an expectation of privacy for my school locker than my Myspace, and schools constantly warn that lockers are subject to random checks, including with drug dogs, and if they have probable cause that you are breaking school rules your locker will be searched.  \n\tSchools have, or should have, the right to subject any material brought into the school to search or seizure if given probable cause.  Basically my view on it is if you don’t want your principal to see it, then don’t bring it to school.  The issue is a little cloudier with Myspace because the bulletin wasn’t brought in to the school, but was posted in a setting where many of the perpetrator’s classmates could see and read it.  It is the schools job to look out for the interests and safety of its students - there are cases where it is acceptable for schools to interfere in non-academic issues to protect students, like when one student gets a dangerous and contagious disease it is the school’s responsibility to notify other students that they may be infected as well.\n\tThe line is very unclear for the amount of power schools should have.  I would say that it should stop at interfering with home life and what students do outside of school, but schools have the right to call social services if they think a bad home life is affecting a student, and they have the right to suspend students who are found drinking.  The bottom line is that by sending their children to school for 6 hours a day parents are conferring a huge amount of responsibility on the school to keep their child safe, and that responsibility doesn’t just last during school hours.  The right of schools to invade privacy is often questioned in legitimate circumstances, but reading a public bulletin posted on the internet should not be one of them.\n",
        "      Regardless of my personal feelings about war in general, I am hard-pressed to find any legitimate political reason for the invasion of Iraq.  Feeding on escalated feelings of anti-terrorism in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, President Bush convinced the country that Saddam Hussein was an immediate threat in possession of weapons of mass destruction who needed to be removed from power.  In a most anti-constitutional fashion, Congress granted the President power to deploy troops and attack Iraq without making a formal declaration of war. (According to the Constitution, only Congress has the power to declare war, at the President’s request)  The faulty planning and the poor strategy that followed created devastating effects.  The number of dead American soldiers and dead Iraqis is still rising three years later.  But after having been there for so long, after turning their world upside down, how can the United States abandon the Iraqi citizens now? \n      Bush had a special word for his invasion of Iraq; he called it a pre-emptive strike – attack them before they have the chance to attack us.  His administration claimed to have evidence that proved Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.  Based on this rationale, why hasn’t the U.S. invaded North Korea?  This is a country whose government openly advertises its possession of nuclear capabilities.  Yet North Korea remains untouched.  After taking over Iraq, no weapons of mass destruction were actually found.  And so questions arise, questions about the real motives behind the war effort.  Some speculate that it was a personal vendetta, passed on from father to son.  It was indeed President Herbert Walker Bush who launched the first attack against Saddam Hussein in the 1st Gulf War.  Others say the reason had to do with money, and greed of the United States in its desire to control the rich oil region.  \n      U.S. troops easily overthrew the Iraqi government and scared Saddam into hiding.  In the absence of government, a power vacuum formed, a vacuum for which Bush did not have a plan to effectively control.  Looting and vandalism plagued the streets of Iraqi towns and villages.  There was no law and no law enforcement to hold the people in check.  It took time for the U.S. government to implement a democratic form of government there.  If anyone knows the amount of time, struggle, and dedication it takes to establish a steady, functioning democratic government, it should be the United States, the first modern democratic nation.  Nearly 100 years after its inception, the country divided itself in a bloody civil war.  How could the U.S. government, backed originally by a majority of the U.S. people, imagine that a change of such magnitude would happen in Iraq in one decisive stroke?  \n      The U.S. government sent neither substantial troops nor substantial equipment.  The American forces in Iraq were left insufficiently prepared to deal with the military insurgents that still linger today.  Thousands upon thousands of American soldiers have died, many from unpreventable car bombs and individual suicide bombers.  Part of the solution to this problem is to train local police forces, something the American troops are doing now.  But this takes time and money, more time and money than the government originally planned on expending.\n      The U.S. government, no matter how wrong it was in starting this war, now has a responsibility to the Iraqi people to finish it.  The U.S. has a responsibility to leave Iraq in a state of peace and security.  This is only right since peace and security is what the U.S. government took away.\n      \n\n",
        "      The Iraq war is without a doubt the most controversial topic on the news today.  There are many different subtopics to discuss within the subject itself, the two most common being whether the reasons for going into Iraq in the first place were justifiable and whether we should still be there.  Since the United States is already there, I don’t think it is worth it at this point in time to point fingers about who was right or wrong about going in.  However, it is relevant to discuss the option of pulling out.\n      I admit that I am undereducated on the subject from a political science perspective, but I have heard stories of what goes on over in Iraq from a primary source.  My friend was a marine who enlisted right before 9/11, so he was one of the first people to be sent over as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  He has shared with me numerous stories of his time spent in Baghdad as well as other cities.  One base he was stationed at the marines nicknamed Camp Incoming, because the base was under attack 24 hours a day.  One night at Camp Incoming, my friend remembers lying down outside with all of his gear on (in case of emergency) with the rain soaking through his inadequate raincoat, falling asleep to the sound of incoming mortars.  He told me that he didn’t really fall asleep as so much pass out from exhaustion, and imagined that what he felt “must be what it feels like to have AIDS.”\n      After listening to all of his stories, I can’t help but demanding a damn good reason for sending kids my age overseas to go through hell and possibly die thousands of miles from home.  At this point, pulling out of Iraq seems the appropriate thing to do. If we have created a mess, then we should attempt at cleaning it up.  However, cleaning up that mess is what we have spent months upon months trying to do, but to no measurable progress.  In my opinion, the war has gone on long enough, and we should stop trying to undertake impossible tasks and literally save the world before more of our brothers and sisters die as they are every single day.\n",
        "\tThe Catholic Church has been around for a very, very long time, and has certainly seen its ups and downs.  At the beginning of this semester, one of my professors mentioned that we’d be learning about “Popes gone wild, or if you’ll have it, Renaissance papacy!”.  During the renaissance and immediately pre-Luther days, the church certainly saw its dark days.  I suppose that what it all comes down to is the integrity of the people in charge.  I mean, the church has done some great things in terms of humanitarian aid and human decency, and many of its fundamental messages are good.  Christianity (and Catholocism, as one of its sub-sects) has some fundamentally good messages at its heart.\n\tThe messages that we are supposed to take from the Bible center around human decency and improvement.  We are supposed to treat each other well, and care for each of our fellow human beings as if they are brothers and sisters.  However, these messages don’t always make it through.  Religion is the manner in which human beings go about answering questions that are essentially unanswerable (Who created us?  Why?  What is the meaning of our existence?  What happens after we die?).  People tend to become overly passionate when answering these questions, and even defensive about their “righteousness”.\n\tMany people pervert the essential Christian messages for their own ends.  For instance, the “religious right” which has begun to pervade the American political system.  They distract our politicians and citizens from important issues, such as globalization’s effects on human rights, the environmental consequences of our actions, and our coming energy crisis.  When these things hit us harder, people will probably be like “Hey wait, we should have done something about this when those asshole media-frenzied church people were complaining about gay marriage and abortion”.  Gay marriage and abortion are semi-important questions, but they don’t need to be fought as crusades.\n\tIn fact, I think Catholocism and Christianity are inherently un-political, and should be kept as such.  They are supposed to be implemented on a personal level – we are supposed to love our neighbors, treat people well, not steal, kill, or cheat, and in general, be kind.  We are supposed to focus on ourselves and our conduct, and are made to believe that if we do a good job then we will be eternally rewarded (the carrot, dangling from the stick, which draws people in).\n\tWith more relevance to the prompt, the pedophile priest phenomena was unfortunate for its victims, surely.  However, I’m glad that it finally knocked the Catholic church off its high-horse of infallible legitimacy.  The pedophilia allegations constitute chapter 2344687 in the book of “Horribly Evil Things Done By Clergy Since The Beginning of Recorded Time”, figuratively.\n\tSo basically, I don’t really want anything to do with the Catholic church, because when you devote yourself to a certain predetermined series of beliefs, you are limiting yourself from full comprehension of those other than your own.  Before anyone becomes a Catholic, they should first study Islam, Judaism, and other religions.  If they don’t, they are probably just sticking within their comfort zone and flocking to what they are comfortable with (namely, the religion which is most commonly expressed around them).  I hate it when people say “hey my religion is great, you are going to hell”.\n",
        "\tThere is no legal reason to make gay marriage impossible.  Decisions about whether weddings can be performed in a church and recognized as a religious union should be left up to the leaders of specific religions, and the state should stick to determining whether a union is worthy of a legal marriage certificate.  Many gay couples show the same level of commitment as straight couples - they live together, raise children together, and grow old together in sickness and in health.  Why should they not be given the same legal benefits and rights as straight couples?\n\tReligious arguments are perfectly valid.  It is totally dependent on religious leaders to decide whether or not homosexuality is a sin or accepted by their religion, and the attitude members should take toward homosexuals.  They can even decide what rights gay people will have within a religion - whether they will ever be allowed to become priests or rabbis or just allowed to be lay people.  However, that has no effect ( or shouldn’t, at any rate) on the legalization of gay marriage by the government.  Voters and legislators both have to start separating the two issues in their minds.  The decision on whether or not to allow gay marriage should have nothing to do with personal feelings of approval or disapproval of homosexuality.\n\tMembers of the gay community are part of a minority just like Hispanics or African Americans and should be treated accordingly.  The government would never think of denying the right of marriage to African Americans, so why should it to homosexuals?  There is no psychological difference between gay people and straight people; it’s not like they have a mental defect, they just have a different sexual orientation.  They feel the same way about their partners as husbands do about their wives and vice versa, and gay relationships have been shown to be very similar to straight relationships.  Children raised by gay parents have been shown to be well adjusted for the most part, and many children raised by straight couples have been shown to have psychological issues.  The health of children has nothing to do with the orientation of the parents, just the methods and effectiveness of parenting, and so cannot be used as an argument against gay marriage - especially since allowing it would give children a better sense of stability and normality in their home life.\n\tPresident Bush’s proposal for an amendment banning gay marriage is uncalled for and highly questionable from an ethical and legal standpoint.  On what grounds are we trying to deny these people a basic right that everyone else in America enjoys?  They are not posing a threat to heterosexual marriage.  It’s not as if by seeing the happiness of a married gay couple more people are going to become gay.  Heterosexual families and gay families will always remain unique and should be treated as two separate entities, not just a deviation of a single entity.  This is especially a legally charged issue because Bush is not only trying to deny a status of equality to a significant minority in the United States, but legal rights as well like housing, tax and health care advantages.  The federal government should definitely be involved in this issue, but on the side of the rights of the people that it swore to uphold and protect.  If gay people are allowed to live in the United States, own property here, have jobs here, shop here, and be active parts of their communities, then they deserve the same rights as heterosexual people who influence American society and economy in the same ways.\n",
        "What really is “gay marriage”?  It is a socially, governmentally, and religiously recognized marriage in which two people of the same sex live together as a family.  Many supportive of  same-sex marriage often use the term \"equal marriage\" to stress that they seek equality as opposed to special rights.  Opponents argue that equating same-sex and opposite-sex marriage changes the meaning of marriage and its traditions.  I feel that the suggestion of reserving the word \"marriage\" for religious contexts, and in civil and legal contexts using a uniform concept of civil unions is the best answer.  Does our declaration not say all men are created equal? So, why should same sex couples be denied the same rights as heterosexual couples?  I feel that civil unions between same sex couples should have identical legal status to a marriage, and partners gain all the same benefits and associated legal rights; ranging from tax exemptions and joint property rights, to next of kin status, and shared parenting responsibilities.  Those who advocate that marriage should be defined exclusively as the union of one man and one woman argue that heterosexual unions provide the procreative foundation of the family unit that is the chief social building block of civilization.  My issue with this argument is that then we should not allow couples that cannot have children to be married either.  Also, those who do not plan to have children should also not be allowed to be married.  The procreation argument cannot reasonably be used against same-sex marriage, particularly since technological advances allow gay couples to have their own related biological children.  Supporters also argue that making it available to more people would strengthen the institution of marriage, and furthermore that same-sex marriage would encourage gays and lesbians to settle down with one partner and raise families. Others argue that marriage no longer retains a procreative function of the government since many governments offer child tax credits and assistance regardless of marital status.\nThe example in our government of calling marriage an institution between a man and a woman infuriates me.  It is just a bit more proof of the fact that the separation between church and state no longer exists. The fact that our president called for an amendment banning even a civil union between same sex couples is appalling.  The president is the last person who should be allowing his religious opinions to cloud his judgment.  It is understandable that  gay marriage inspires its own set of passions, with opponents decrying it as a step that will undermine the very fabric of society while supporters posit it as an inevitable next stage in step-by-step acceptance of homosexuality by mainstream America.  But why, is that wrong?  Should we not accept our fellow man in all his many shapes and sizes.  If religiosity is the main contender against gay marriage, is it not true that most religions advocate acceptance and the matter of turning the other cheek.  My belief is that homosexual couples are no different from heterosexual couples and should be treated as such.  \n",
        "\tI think the Catholic Church came a long way during the papacy of Pope John Paul II in terms of modernizing and reaching out to people of the world today, but still has many changes to make to fully adapt to life in the 21st century.  It’s very hard to balance the value of traditions such as not allowing birth control with modern values today and will by no means be an easy or quick process, although that is what people are calling for.  The problem is that such an evolution of society and technology has taken place over the past hundred or so years that an institution like the Church that has undergone a minimal amount of change since its inception 2000 is an anachronism.  It will take patience on the part of everyone involved to bring the Catholic Church to a resolution with the standards of modern people.\n\tThere are many aspects of Church doctrine that should be updated, like not allowing women priests or priests to be married.  In a society where women and men have achieved equal roles, or are trying to, it is important that an institution advocating equal rights should put into practice what it preaches.  There is no reason except tradition that women should not be priests, not to say that traditions are useless.  There are plenty of good traditions the can remind us of our heritage or unite people as a family or even a country, like the Fourth of July.  But when traditions are followed blindly for centuries without question, they can turn into harmful biases and inhibit change and growth.  There are many traditions the Catholic Church should hold on to, but the Latin Mass wasn’t one of them and celibate priests aren’t either.\n\tThere is much to be said for keeping strongly to convictions in the face of opposition, and the Catholic Church has been good at that from the moment of its birth.  But there is also much to be said for reviewing one’s convictions in light of the situation.  In the Bible, God told Moses that lepers were ritually unclean, but Jesus, in a much later place and time, declared that lepers were God’s children as much as any of us and were to be treated like so.  Vatican II proves that we don’t have to wait for Christ’s second coming to see changes happen in the Church.  Many aspects of Church tradition were changed then and Catholicism didn’t fall apart.  It may have lost some members who were upset by a change, but it gained many more who found the new, more modern Church more accessible to them.  There are going to be positive and negative consequences to a change in any organization as far-reaching and ancient as the Catholic Church, but long term benefits must be considered as well as the immediate emotional responses that are sure to happen among members.\n\tAs to the recent bout of pedophilia accusations dealing with Catholic priests, I believe that to be a separate issue from modernization in the Church.  Pedophilia is a serious mental illness, and there are both genetic and environmental aspects to the expression of any mental illness.  Perhaps there is such a relatively high rate of pedophilia among priests because many men who felt unnatural attraction to children became priests in hopes that the constant exposure to religion and vows of celibacy would keep their urges in check.  In any case, they were all well aware that no female priests were allowed and they would never be getting married.  If once they were priests they were overwhelmed with the responsibility or felt the call to marriage, they could have left the priesthood.  Although this isn’t easy and s heavily disapproved of, it’s not as if you’re going to jail or the Catholic Church will take out a bounty on your head if you leave the priesthood.  I think there are a lot of things the Church could do to modernize itself and make itself more in tune to its members, but it can’t influence whether or not priests are pedophiles.  Who knows how long this problem has existed - just because in the past few years it has been exposed doesn’t mean it’s new at all.  The Church should remove priests with pedophilia from power positions and get them the help they need, but it should concentrate on reaching out to the modern world.\n",
        "\tBecause sites like MySpace are public sites and pretty much everyone is aware that whatever is posted on a MySpace site is readable by the general public I do not think that it was invasion of privacy to use information posted on a students MySpace to stop a school shooting. Considering that in doing this, the school saved the lives of its students, I think that their actions were completely justified. If the student wanted what they posted to be private, then they should have written it in a diary or a blog. By posting it in a bulletin, they were putting it out there for anyone to see and have access to. Considering sites such as MySpace and Facebook are used to find information on future employees and to use against many teens that go to court, it is no surprise that schools are jumping on the bandwagon to find information about their students. I do not think this was an invasion of privacy because when I think of privacy, I definitely do not think of MySpace. MySpace is a place where anyone can find out anything about you if you post it on your page and if a creepy old man can stalk teenage girls through it and that not be considered an invasion of privacy, then protecting students by using information posted on a MySpace should not be either. If there are things that you do not want people to know, then you should not put it where everyone can see it. On MySpace it is possible to post private blogs that can only be read by the creator of the page or certain friends chosen by the creator so it is almost as though he wanted to get caught. By posting a bulletin the student was basically sending out a letter to everyone who was on his friend list and I’m sure many of the people he is MySpace friends with are his classmates, and if one of them saw the post and it was something they were genuinely concerned about I am sure they would have said something to a parent or teacher just to be on the safe side. It is almost the fault of the student who posted the bulletin that the shooters were caught. Typically things like this are meant to be secret and a surprise attack, but by announcing the plan to the world, he took that away and he really has no one to blame but himself.\n      What I do think would be an invasion of privacy is going into a students locker or backpack or any other private item owned by the student. I know that lockers are technically school property, but I do consider going into a locker without a really good reason unfair and unlawful. I also do not agree with schools doing such things as bringing in drug sniffing dogs. I think that it is important that students feel safe while they are in school, but I also think that it is important that the administration does not violate the rights of the students. \n\n\n",
        "What does invading privacy even mean? Does it mean that school officials can look at your myspace page and they can ask you questions about it in school? Or is it just as simple as sitting in front of your computer screen reading a stranger’s face book wall? I think before one can judge when the school officials can invade someone’s privacy they must distinguish what is privacy? What’s private versus non private? What does invading mean? Frankly invading can mean something as serious as invading someone’s house or discreetly listening in on someone’s conversation.  \nPersonally I feel that invading privacy can be mix of all the things previously mentioned. In this case I feel that school officials are going to look at myspace and facebook regardless of whether they are in school or not because of them probably have on anyway. I believe that it is fine to look at a student’s facebook or myspace page as long as they don’t act on anything unless someone is in danger. Moreover I believe that this was an invasion of privacy. The school officials just stopped what potentially could have been a deadly school shooting. I think that where they should draw the line: on life and death situations. If students are just trying to express themselves in there own way then no I say the school officials should just leave the students alone. But when it comes down to innocent children dying as a result of some demented child who wants to take his personal problems out on people, then I would say that the school officials are allowed to take action here. When I was in high school, three girls where asked to withdraw because of pictures they posted on face book in they displayed girl-on-girl action in the school’s bathroom facilities. My high school was a girl’s catholic high school which some would think would give them reason to ask the girls to withdraw but I don’t think so. I believe that action between girls like the way they posed is totally normal. If you think about isn’t that a characteristic that is unique to girls; we are more friendly, more sexual with our friends than boys are. But I digress, the main point is that I believe in that instance the school was using the face that the internet is a big free-for-all to incriminate the girls. \nI feel that school officials should draw the line at life and death situations. They should not interfere with students and their natural want to express themselves. Although the internet isn’t the safest place to express their feelings; it still gives kids a place to say what’s on their minds and not bottle it up inside. \nHowever, kids need to realize that the places like myspace are open to the public. I think that they think because it has there name on it and they are the ones controlling it that they are the only ones looking at it, however naïve that may be. Kids should understand that the World Wide Web in public domain and anyone can read their “personal” business. \n\n",
        "Privacy rights…That is a hot button issue all right.  In the information age, well, privacy is a hot commodity.  Whether that is on the Internet, in your home, in everyday normal life, privacy is hard to find.  Now that we have the Internet things are even worse.  People place everything on the Internet.  Pictures.  Stories.  Credit Card numbers.  Everything is out there for the world to see.  Most people don’t even enable security features; even more don’t know security features exist.  We have things like Facebook.com, and Myspace.com.  These were originally made as networking sites.  Myspace.com came first.  It allowed people to make profiles, send messages, and post bulletins.  You aren’t supposed to be able to have a Myspace.com account until you are fifteen, however, no one checks and so it easy for children to lie and retain an account.  What was originally a networking web site, has now become a free for all of teenagers and college students playing around on the Internet, showing off their mischief.   Let’s move on to Facebook.  Originally a networking site meant for college students.  You had to have a valid college email address to have a profile.  Rather recently it was opened to the public.  Students have pictures of them drinking underage, engaging in numerous illicit and illegal activities.   They don’t seem to realize that things on the Internet are open to everyone.  Once something is anywhere on the Internet it is public domain.  The Internet is a public domain.  You put it out there someone is going to see it.  Your RA, your principal, your teachers, or even your parents.  Don’t be shocked if you get a phone call about a picture, which was shown, to your parents of you “totally wasted”.  \nIn reference to the situation in the prompt, no, it’s not an invasion of privacy.  First of all, to see bulletin’s on Myspace.com you have to be that person’s MySpace “friend”.  It does not seem like the teachers were trolling the MySpace boards just trying to find problems.  It seems that this was brought to their attention by another student.  How can that be an invasion of privacy?  The job of the supervisors at the school was to protect the majority of the students, not only teach them.  They had to act even though this may have just been a joke by this student.  I think this example should show teens as well as children and adults that when you say something, especially on the Internet, it can come back to haunt you.  You could be joking, you could be serious, perhaps you just weren’t thinking but these things can come back to haunt you.  This is a big issue in colleges right now, due to Facebook.  Students post pictures of them at parties, or drinking with their friends.  They forget that their RA, and their dean , and their teachers ,and even their parents could easily have a facebook account and be viewing these pictures.  Some colleges are even using facebook pictures as “evidence” in the judicial process.  There’s a fine line, but people need to realize that once you put something on the internet, it’s no longer private. \n",
        "\tAs with any institution that’s been around for a millennium or so, the Catholic Church is inherently resistant to change. That’s a nicer way of saying “conservative.” Because of this, it’s acquired the outward semblance of a frat, a good ol’ boys organization. The hierarchy has the power and money to preserve itself by any means necessary, and frequently the means involves covering up the less tasteful deeds of its rank and file members. A similar principle operates in political machines. That’s not to say that the Church hasn’t done and doesn’t continue to do a great deal of good in the world; rather, that the insular character of the Church as an organization can sometimes promote systems of abuse which remain carefully hidden. \n\tAsking the Church to adapt to life in the 21st century, though, is a little like asking a duck-billed platypus to fly the space shuttle. The theological character of the Church is at odds with many aspects of modern life on basic points. Ladies and gentlemen of the court, I present for your edification exhibit A: The Church’s attitude toward homosexuals, or “inherently disordered persons,” as they’ve quaintly come to term them. Most people have come to accept homosexuality as part of everyday life in the 21st century world.  The Catholic Church, however, insists upon seeing it as either the product of bad parenting (often in bizarrely Freudian terms), an “accident” in the gene pool, or just straightforward perversion. While most advocates for gay rights these days do indeed argue that it’s genetic, none of them would apply “accident” as the nominal word of choice. \n\tThe Church’s views on women, after having had years of spit and polish applied, still look musty in a modern context, too. It’s hierarchy is of a doggedly paternalistic bend. Certainly, there have been many famous nuns and female lay members (Mother Theresa and Dorothy Day, for examples), but these women have wielded little power in the actual operation of the Church. This seems odd, especially in view of the fact that Catholic dogma reiterates repeatedly the idea that men and women were made for each other. If that were so, why are there no female priests? It would seem to lend a good deal more balance to the picture. Maybe balance isn’t the end goal, but I can’t conceive of what else it might be, and it certainly isn’t pedophilia.\n\tMarriage itself has been a big point of contention with and within the Church for some time now. Priestly marriage was initially banned because social views on inheritance complicated things for Church landholdings; priests with children often tried to bequeath the land to their offspring. This seems like a remarkably un-theological reason for enforced celibacy. These days, it isn’t as though a way around that contingency couldn’t be found with some creativity. Protestant ministers and others have been “ministering to their flocks” for centuries while keeping families at home, and this doesn’t seem to have caused any widespread detriment. But the Church likes to remain static, and so we’ve seen no motion toward the idea of a married priesthood, although, from a sociological standpoint, this would have a good deal of beneficial impact.  \n",
        "\tThe Iraqi war is definitely an event that I do not agree with the Bush Administration on. I think that it is pointless killing that will not solve any problems and it is time to bring our troops home before more fatalities occur. We have been over there for several years now, and we have yet to see anything get accomplished. It almost feels as though Bush is continuing this war for his own selfish ambition rather than the reasons he originally stated for it. I think that Bush has lost a lot of support by keeping our troops in Iraq for so long, yet he does not seem to care. It seems as though there is some ulterior motive or something because what he is doing just does not seem to make sense. I think that he should put himself in the shoes of the soldiers who are in Iraq and maybe he will see how ridiculous and unreasonable he is being. I am sure that if he were over in Iraq fighting a war with no end or solution in sight he would wonder what the point is too. This war has definitely gone on long enough and it is about time it ends.\n\tIt almost seems as though the United States is incapable of staying out of the affairs of other countries. Iraq is its own country and therefore should be permitted to deal with its own problems and establish its own government. We should not have to sacrifice the mothers, fathers, children, brother, sisters, etc of American families so that Bush can continue his pointless war. Sadaam is gone; there is no authority figure to fight anymore. If a country does not want our help, who are we to move in and try to take over? If they want to blow each other up, that is their choice, but unless they make a personal attack on the U.S., then Bush should just mind his own business. There are so many problems we are dealing with back in the States, and I think that Bush should deal with those before he goes and tries to fix the problems of others. Although the United States has a lot of things going for it and a lot of positives, this country is far from perfect, so it seems a little hypocritical to go and tell another country how to leave when we do not even have it all together. Iraq was built on different terms and religious values, and if they are rejecting the values that the U.S. is trying to instate, then Bush should just let it go. If they really wanted our help they would ask or at least stop killing American soldiers. At this point, it almost seems as though the killing is more Bush’s fault than the Iraqis. He knows what is going on over there and that nothing is being accomplished. It is his responsibility to put an end to all this craziness and just bring everyone home. \n",
        "      I definitely feel that gender discrimination is an issue in the present-day United States.  I also feel that women are discriminated against much more than men, especially in the workplace.  Regardless of opinions, studies have been done which show that on average, men receive higher salaries than women who perform the exact same jobs.  To me, this seems completely unfair.  If two people do the exact same thing, have the same role and perform the same tasks, why should the male get paid more than the female?  This is gender discrimination.\n\tYou often hear about the glass ceiling that women fact in the workplace, particularly in the business world.  They can see above, where they might like to go, but they can not actually reach it.  In the hierarchy of Corporate America, most (not all) of the highest ranking positions are held by men.  Yes, women are involved in management and have high level jobs, but the majority of the top positions are filled by men.  It often seems that women can climb the ladder, but they can not quite make it all the way up to the top.  I can’t see the fairness in this.  If women are equally as qualified, why can’t they hold the same positions as men?\n\tI don’t know how to solve this problem until the stereotypes are eliminated.  What I mean is that until we as a society get over these misconceptions, we will not be able to eliminate gender discrimination.  For example, say that two people are being interviewed for a top management job.  They both have identical resumes, but one of the applicants is female and the other is male.  If the general atmosphere in the office is that men can perform these leadership jobs better than women, just this stereotype works against the woman.  If the employer feels that the man will receive more respect from his peers than the female, this will help the male to better perform his job and thus it makes sense to hire the man over the woman.  This vicious cycle will repeat itself over and over again.  The women never get the chance to earn the respect that they deserve because in order to earn the respect, they have to be given the opportunity to prove themselves worthy of that respect.\n\tI do not feel that men are discriminated against nearly as much as women.  One way that I can think that men face discrimination is in the stereotype of women being more nurturing and better at taking care of children.  For example, when a couple gets divorced, often the mother is more likely to get custody of the children.  This situation has begun to improve greatly.  Another example of this stereotype against men would be to think of a situation of a day care center.  Imagine that you went to drop your kids off to daycare and all of the teachers at the day care were men.  You might me somewhat more hesitant to leave your kids with these men than you would to leave them with a group of women.   But in general, I feel that women face much more discrimination than men do.\n",
        "\tI don’t feel that the Catholic Church needs to change if it does not want to.  The beliefs within the Catholic Church are their beliefs and it is not up to anybody but themselves to decide whether to change their ways or not.  Though I feel it would be nice if they were to become more open about certain issues (allowing female priests, allowing gay marriage, etc) I don’t feel that it is in my power, public power, or the governments power to force them to change.  This would be no different than them forcing their beliefs on everybody else.\n\tThe whole ordeal with pedophilia within the Catholic Church has been restricted to only several locations and people tend to make a bigger deal out of it than it actually is.  There is pedophilia in many more places than the Catholic Church and people only see it as a big deal there because priests are supposed to be moral teachers to those who attend the church.  In order to deal with this issue it would be best if they were to get background checks on who is becoming a priest and determine their real motive.  Most priests and members of the Catholic Church frown upon this behavior and see it as a disgrace.\n\tWhile some of the views held within the Catholic Church are outdated, nobody should force them to flow with the sands of time.  If part of their belief system relies on following works of the past, then so be it.  As long as they allow me to go about my own personal business, I have no problem with allowing them to go about theirs.  They disagree with what I believe and I may disagree with what they believe.  That is how our society functions.  It is not a “one way” nation.  Freedom is what allows us to keep our same views, even if they are the same views that we’ve had for centuries and it is what allows us to change our views, even if it goes against the grain.\n\tI don’t think that anything can really be done to prevent cases of pedophilia or any other kind of church corruption since this is all reliant on the person.  Whether it be those who are in charge of the church or the priest themselves, what happens relies on them and it is up for the people of the church to speak up against it, not someone who is not a member.  For example: I am not an employee of a McDonalds, therefore I have no right to rise up against the McDonalds manager and try to bring him down.  Granted, changes could be made for the better of the employees, I would not have a full blown knowledge of the entire situation.\n\tThis is not to say that what is going on is right.  By no means is it right to allow this to take place.  That is why we have the court system, where religion is forgotten and the law is brought in.  Separation of church and state does not protect crime.\n",
        "\tI believe that the Catholic Church does need to change its ways. With many issues, the Church is bound in the ways of the bible. The bible, being written many years ago does not take into account new ways of thinking. \n      Priests have many rules they need to obey. They are not allowed to be married; they are seen as being married to the Church. In many other religions the holy men are allowed to be married and still serve their faith. I don’t think there would be much of a change if priests were allowed to have a wife. Their devotion to their faith would not be changed. Having a family and a wife does not mean you cannot still serve in your job. Look at all other professions; all the men and women who hold jobs are still able to have a family if they want to. The church should be no different. A family does not change a devotion to faith.\n      Having female priests would also be a positive change for the church. Since the founding of the Catholic Church, priests have been required to be male. But what is the difference? Why is a man a better fit for a holy man? I don’t understand what the difference would be; a female could hold the same devotion as a male. \n      Now we need to take into account the recent acts of pedophilia involving priests in the Catholic Church. I do not believe that this act would have been change if priests were allowed to be married. These terrible acts happen even now all over the country. Not always with priests, but with other men who think this is a good idea. Allowing priests to marry would not have changed how they acted. They acted inappropriately and should be punished.\n      The Catholic Church holds many strong views on issues that are currently being discussed in our world. On the issue of sex, the Church believes in abstinence until marriage, and do not condone any other form of birth control. Although this is the view that most would hope is being followed, this is not the case. Many people who have yet to be married are having sexual relations. Isn’t it more important to help the health and well being of the people involved? Now that our society has altered views on this issue, isn’t it time for our church to follow?\n      The same goes with the topic of gay marriage and gay rights in general. The Catholic Church holds strong disapproval of gay marriage. This has become an immense issue in our society which is involving government in making the final decision, but the Church should look into learning more about the issue to try and accept it. The Church should be a place where you can come to feel one with god, no matter what your sexual preference is.\n      The Catholic Church has to make some changes to catch up to the 21st century. Many strides have been made in other branches of life in the United States but the church is one place that has never changed.\n",
        "      The Catholic Church has received a lot of negative energy from many different people, mostly because these people think that the Church is too forward with its views and opinions and because they think the Church tries too hard to convert everyone into believing that the Church’s views and opinions are the only right ones.  What I believe as a Catholic is that the church is widely and grossly misunderstood not only by the American public, but most of the people around the world as well.  First of all, people have a right to believe in whatever religion or different type of credo that they want, regardless whether the government controlling wherever they live thinks they deserve this right or not.  Knowing this, every person should consider their options and take their time and energy deciding what they would like to identify themselves as, as to not falsely join a belief system that they don’t believe in.  After taking the time to decide, the person should be committed to their beliefs, and stand up for what they believe is right.  This is all I think the Catholic Church has done in the 21st century.  Therefore, I do not believe the Catholic Church is too archaic for a massive adaptation for the 21st Century to take place.  However, if at any point the situation changes and the Church does become too archaic, I would support appropriate change within the Church as long as they kept the same basic doctrines and beliefs.\n      As far as the publicized scandals concerning Catholic priests committing various acts of pedophilia, I am disgusted.  One must take into account that priests are still human, and that they are not perfect.  Still, these people have failed miserably at the tasks assigned to them, and the Church as well as the government should punish them to the maximum extent allowed for such a disgusting and unspeakable crime.  Every other person with any other ordinary job would be given the same punishment for these crimes, and priests do not deserve any special treatment just because they are affiliated with a religion.  If Catholic priests were allowed to marry, there might have been a chance that they would not have resorted to the aforementioned acts of pedophilia.  However, centuries upon centuries of priests have found it manageable to do their duty without molesting children, so there is no excuse for the current state of affairs.\n      The pedophilia scandal just represents another failure of the Catholic Church in large, and history has proven that the Catholic Church is not perfect by any means.  The most obvious and horrendous example would be the crusades, which caused an almost uncontested level of death and suffering.  Since the Church holds its ideals with such steadfastness, people hold them to high standards (as they should) and call them hypocrites at the first sign of wrongdoing.  However, I have a Catholic message to point of the flaw of the arguments of these people – let he without sin cast the first stone.\n",
        "\tI absolutely feel as though the Catholic Church has to change its ways in order to \nadapt to the 21st century.  Two major issues come to my mind when I think of the \nCatholic Church; those issues are Gay marriage and abortion.  I am a very liberal person \nand I see eye to eye with many of the political views held my leftist in the political world.  \nThus I believe that gays should be allowed to marry just as any other couple that is in \nlove should have the right to marriage and obviously I also believe that women should \nhave the choice to abort a pregnancy should the circumstance present itself.  The church \ndoes not believe that either should be allowed and its justification comes from religious \ndoctrine that was given or written for us thousands of years ago.  I don’t want to seem \nlike I am mooching the church but to be honest things change drastically in a matter of \ndecades let alone in a matter of centuries.  We have the proper medical procedures to \nperform abortions with out harming the women.  Furthermore, to quote church doctrine \nthat is older than time, and say that a man can not marry another man because in the bible \nit says that marriage is between a man and a women is preposterous.  In the biblical times \nif somebody were to come out and pronounce there homosexuality they could be subject \nto blood letting or a lobotomy, you know to get the “gay out of them.”  Heck if you want \nto go back even further there are numerous written accounts of homosexual acts within \nthe Spartan male communities as well as with in the Greek schools for men.  Older \nSpartans would regularly engage in acts of homosexuality with younger Spartans and it \nwas perfectly permissible.  This leads me right into my next topic which would be older \nclergy men, specifically priests over stepping their bounds and engaging in sexual acts \nwith younger church going boys.  What is the difference between Sparta and the churches \nin Boston where Priests were raping boys?  In Sparta it was part of the culture, in \nAmerica it is a clear act of rape preformed by a priest that is sexually uneasy due to years \nof celibacy and perhaps in many cases unrequited love.  The Catholic Church needs to \nstart to allow their priests to marry.  It may seem ridiculous due to centuries of church \nrule against it, however, a married sexually fulfilled priest could perform his job just as \nwell as a celibate one, and without the worry of perhaps raping a boy.  Rabbi’s and \nministers of all other religions are permitted to marry and live normal lives all the while \ndevoting themselves to their work and their God.  Along the same lines, women are also \nallowed to be Rabbi’s and Ministers, to not allow women to be Catholic Priests is a major \ngender discrimination that our country has overlooked for far too long.  It is time for the \nChurch to meet the times, steps need to be taken to modernize what is now becoming an \noutdated major religious movement.    \n",
        "\tI feel that, over the past 150 years in America, we have progressed leaps and bounds in the direction of gender equality.  At one time or another, America has disenfranchised women, forced them into strict gender roles, and adopted educational structures which disadvantage females.  Presently, none of these things overtly happen any more.\n\tWomen fought for the right to vote in America, and it worked (slowly but surely!).  In our schools, we still teach children about the “struggle for women’s suffrage in America”.  This struggle is a textbook example of the American political dream in action – a certain group expresses its collective voice contrary to societal convention, is not subjected to repression, and through rational/political actions, achieves its ends (freedom to democratically participate).  Women today may participate just as freely in the American political process as men, and are not countered by institutionalized sexism.\n\tThe extension of voting rights to women was a milestone, but by no means did it instantly give the sexes equal status.  Gender roles still encouraged women to stay at home.  Some women worked in factories (most notoriously, in textiles), but the wages/accommodations were meager.  During the Second World War, the need for male foot soldiers coupled with the need for manufactured industrial goods once again sent scores of women into factories.  After the war, however, the “nuclear family” image reinforced “traditional” gender roles, creating a generation of dissatisfied housewives.\n\tThe most loud spoken (and remembered) voice of the “oppressed” housewife generation was Betty Friedan.  Her book The Feminine Mystique empowered women in a fiery way never before seen, and its rhetoric ushered us into the modern era of American gender relations.\n\tRecently, there was talk in congress of a constitutional amendment that would equate men and women (the “Equal Rights Amendment”).  While this amendment didn’t pass, scores of case law regarding gender discrimination have made it clear that overt gender discrimination is illegal in America.\n\tWhile overt discrimination is considered “taboo”, I believe that covert, ingrained discrimination is evident when we view statistics such as the “gender wage gap”.  I don’t know the statistics off the top of my head, but I know that the mean salaries of American men and women are not equal.  There are innumerable women in America who are successful, and some corporate CEOs are female.  However, there is still a wage gap, and I believe the number of male CEOs in America is larger than the number of female CEOs in America.\n\tAll in all, I don’t believe that women are actively “discriminated” against in the work place.  Statistically, however, a large number of CEOs are still men.  These CEOs have much power/influence over the working environments within their companies.  Sexual harassment (not quite equal to discrimination) is certainly a workplace problem, and for every case which is brought to justice, I’d hypothesize that there are many more which aren’t properly dealt with.\n\tSo basically, in retrospect, I think I sort of circumvented the point of this prompt (contemporary, current gender discrimination) by rambling off most of what I know about the political history of American feminism.  Sorry about that.\n",
        "\tThe war in Iraq has been a major issue since the time I was in the 8th grade, after the collapse and attack on the World Trade Center. When I first heard about the incident, I didn’t know that it was a terror attack nor did I know what the World Trade Center was. All I knew was that something happened in the city, and kids were being taken out of school early. I arrived home and the attack was all over the news. I kept seeing the word “war” on the screen; it made me nervous. I had studied about wars in school and thought to myself how lucky we were to not be in a war and how lucky I was to never have had to experience a war. All of a sudden, we were in a war. This kind of war seemed scarier to me though. It was a war not being fought on our battlefields between men who hopefully wanted to be there, but a war on innocent individuals who could not have seen it coming. \n\tOn September 10th, I had travel basketball try-outs with my coach from the previous year, Coach Farrell. Mr. Lynch was Katie’s father, a girl that I had been in school with since kindergarten; we weren’t close friends, but we played sports together. The first try out had ended and he gathered us all around him. I do not remember exactly what he said to us, I can still remember his smile and how happy he was to see us all back on the basketball court. He had a way of encouraging us to do our best, he never made us feel that we could not succeed; he was stern, but never mean. It never mattered if we lost as long as we did our best. Mr. Lynch was a great man who loved his family, his friends, and teaching others a game that he had loved as a child. I may not remember what he said to us after practice, but as we were leaving he said, “See you tomorrow girls!” That was the last time I would ever see Mr. Lynch. His office was located in one of the World Trade Center buildings. They had found an intact check he had written that morning among the rubble; the Lynch family has that check. I do not remember seeing Katie that day, I remember her mother speaking at his funeral, telling us that Farrell lived a good life and would not want us to dwell on his death, but to move on. Mrs. Lynch brought a note card that he had left for her on her dresser before he left for a business trip one week. She read the note card and began to cry. Mrs. Lynch was a strong woman but not that strong. There were 22 people in my parish that had died from the collapse of the towers. These 22 people all left behind families and children. Mr. Lynch’s brother had also died in this tragedy. \n\tBecause of this memory, I do not feel that the war has gone on long enough. I believe that our troops are doing a good job in Iraq, and we should be commending them, we should be supporting them, we should not be questioning whether we want them home or not. They are protecting the thousands of innocent people, like Mr. Lynch, who died for no good reason. Why that day? Why those people? Why those buildings?\n\tI think that war is an awful thing. I wish mankind was more peaceful and never had to go to war, but that is a dream and will never be. So for now, let’s pray for our troops and pray for each other that nothing like this will ever happen again. \n",
        "\tI am all for same sex marriage.  We live in a secular culture, we obey secular laws, and we do not reference the bible for every decision that we have to make in our lives.  But for some reason we as a culture are sitting back and allowing our president to use the bible as the reason why same sex marriages should not be allowed in our country.  I was a member of SAGABA in high school, which stands for the straight and gay and bisexual alliance, I met some of the most passionately in love men and women I know.  So what if they were in love with members of the same sex, love is love is love no matter what the sexual orientation is.  Does the idea of a man and a man living together really still scare our country?  The topic of homosexuality has been raised in the media, on our reality television shows, and even with our very own vice president.  When a show called the real world has seven cast members and every season at least one member is gay, doesn’t that say something about “the real world,” or at least how our society perceives it.  \tGay parents are perfectly capable of providing a safe and proper home for raising a child.  It is my belief that an adopted son or daughter can flourish just the same with same sex parents as he or she would in a traditional household.  If the love is real than the sexual preference should mean nothing.  Our President holds his high Christian morals in very high regard.  Undoubtedly growing up in Texas our president most likely had a slightly slanted impression of homosexuals.  I know I am stereotyping a state an to be honest just a region of our country in general, but its tough for a southerner to see eye to eye with per say somebody from California or Massachusetts.\t\n\tThere should in no way be a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.  The constitution lays the constructs on how to make our country a safe and efficiently run democracy.  It does not tell us who to marry or what is moral.  The constitution is not the bible and it does not contain “God’s word.”  Therefore our president needs to stop quoting the bible as his reason for being so opposed to same sex marriage.  I do not care one way or another if the bible describes marriage as between a man and a woman.  Not every American is Christian and not every American is straight.  If certain states want to ban gay marriage then legally there is no recourse to stop them.  On the same hand if a state, such as California wants to legalize gay marriage they too should be able to do so.  To make such a controversial issue with no clear cut conclusion into a federal law would be premature and unfair to a great percentage of accepting Americans.     \n",
        "I think that although either side is entitled to their opinion the overall idea is that there are American citizens who chose to love people in a nontraditional way, and are chastised for it. For people, like me who are for gay marriage I believe that homosexuals should be offered the same rights as heterosexuals because I feel that if they are feeling the same thing that I feel when I say I am in love with a man and are held back from taking the next step of marriage then its unfair. I also believe that we have to keep fighting for gay marriage because never in American history is something ever truly remembered and recognized if there wasn’t a struggle. Also its understandable, the opposition, because our society was built on heterosexual relationships, and for many this style of living is very weird, and different. What makes accepting homosexual relationships so difficult for some people is the sexual freedom, homosexuals can have sex with whomever they please and never get pregnant. I know from my friends that are homosexual that sometimes I feel the same way that people who oppose gay marriages feel because many of my friends have sex with their best friend’s partner like if its nothing and it’s something that should be expected because they are gay. So sometimes I understand where the opposition comes from because who would to legalize a sex free-for-all? However, I do believe that once homosexuals work out their kinks then people would be more receptive and vote to have gay marriages legalized.  \n\nPresident Bush needs to stop worrying about this small problem. No one is dying, no families are being left without a home, and no children are running around with guns, from homosexuality. But he has innocent Iraqis who aren’t for his never-declared-war being homeless and killed from the anger that other Iraqis have toward the U.S. If I remember correctly from my government class isn’t it up to the states to declare legalization of gay marriage before the federal government gets involved? Once again I believe that the federal government has bigger issues than this. \n\nPresident Bush is allowing his personal opinion to take precedent over society’s needs. Legalizing homosexual will not hurt anyone, so why is this such a huge deal in our society. I believe that President Bush is pushing this problem as a scapegoat for dealing with the bigger problems. The U.S. has bigger problems like there huge debt and the fact that many children die because they don’t have health care, but yet he wants to meddle in the lives of people who are different then him. \n",
        "Subject 15-CATHOLIC CHURCH:  Do you feel the Catholic Church needs to change its ways to adapt to life in the 21st Century?  Regarding all of the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed? (ex. Allowing female priests, allowing priests to marry, etc.)\n\n\n\tI do feel that the Catholic Church needs to change. Being a catholic myself, I know that there are many problems that our religion faces (just like every religion faces...we just seem to get the press coverage for it). I know that there is a strikingly alarming decline in the number of people going into the priesthood. This is bad, because, while decants can give the mass and sermons, they are not really allowed to do Holy Communion. The reason why there in an increase in decants though and a decline in priest, is because priests can not get married and decants can. \n\tI know that in the past, as in years ago, back  in the Roman time, Popes and priest were corrupt and tended to neglect the church and only thought about their families and the money that they were making. It is for this reason, why a rule was made that priests and Popes, Bishops', etc, could not get married. However, I feel that times have drastically changed, that the church is not corrupt anymore, and that we will certainly be able to stop ourselves from going down that path again if it should arise. In Jesus' time, priest were allowed to be married, so I feel that we should have another try at it, and just be weary of our past to learn from it. \n\tMy allowing priests to marry, I believe that the number of cases of pedophilia will go down. The reason is because they will be able to have intercourse with their wives, and will not be tempted to find other ways to satisfy their natural bodily urges. The church does need to recognize that this is a huge problem though, rather then try and cover it up. By covering sex offenders up, it is only tainting our religion, and instead ruining it. Those who are offenders should be dealt with, and should no longer be allowed to practice in the priesthood. I hope, (though I can not be certain) that by allowing priest to marry, the number of offenders will go down. \n\tI also feel that women should be allowed into the priesthood. This would also help solve the problem of lack of priest, and would show that the church does view women as equals, when they say they do, and that we should all treat each other as equals. Women are allowed to become nuns, but nuns can only do so much, and are not allowed to give the mass. I see this as unfair, and should be open to women. \n\tAnother area that I feel that should be updated in the Catholic Church, is the idea that the Pope has the final say in everything. While I do like the fact that we have a unifying person to help decide across the world what our religion is about and to help follow certain guidelines and rules, I do not think he should have absolute power. I feel that it should be a democracy type setting if people tend to disagree with what he says, not of a lot of people, but of at least 30 or so people, so that there is enough variety of opinions to actually decide what is best for the church verses just one man's opinion. \n",
        "\tPreventing a school shooting by accessing information from a MySpace bulletin is not an invasion of privacy by any means.  MySpace, along with Yahoo Personals, Facebook, and many other groups, are all public forum-like environments where information is passed amongst hundreds of thousands of internet users.  If someone posts any information on that type of website, he or she is allowing the world to view whatever information that might be.  Therefore, it makes no sense to treat such usage of that information as an invasion of privacy.\n\tIt is difficult to determine where school officials should draw the line as to whether or not they are invading the privacy of their students.  They must determine exactly what type of information is public and which is private.  Any information that is posted in a public environment, such as MySpace, is a legitimate source of information, especially if it means preventing a school shooting.  To deny the use of this information would be like denying a person the right to look up someone’s phone number in the Yellow Pages.  Any person listed in the Yellow Pages has their right to privacy, but they chose to leave their phone information public.  On the other hand, school officials should not delve into the private lives of any students, whether it is through a personal diary, cell phone text message, or crumpled up letter.  Usage of this type of information is morally wrong and a definite invasion of privacy.  \n",
        "\tHow do I feel about the war? (Runs outside, yells incoherently at the top of his lungs for several minutes, comes back, sits down). Okay, better now. I’m against it. The United States went to war on false and shifting pretexts to satisfy the twisted policy notions of a foreign-relations-ignorant administration. Case the first: Saddam has ties to Al Queda. False. Case the second: Iraq is developing chemical and biological weapons along with various other WMD’s (all caps to increase the scariness quotient) which pose a huge threat to our country. False. Current Case: Saddam was just a really bad dude and it’s in everybody’s best interest to have him out of power. It was our job to do it since we’re the U.S., and are just generally awesome. Also false, but in a more complicated way.\n\tThis line of logic sets the U.S. up as an international police force which not only can intervene in anything, but is obligated to intervene in any kind of conflict. This might sound like a good idea to some people. The main problem is that it means we don’t necessarily intervene in other country’s best interests, but only what we perceive to be their best interests (which, coincidentally, we usually decide have to be in line with our interests). This line of thinking is only a step above the Bush Doctrine, known as that of “preemptive strike” in the general media. Essentially, this breaks down to mean that the U.S. has the right to attack other countries who may or may not pose a threat to it at a whim, regardless of the larger ramifications to whatever region of the world that country is situated in. The ramifications in Iraq so far have been widespread political, social, and economic instability and unrest. The idea of preemptive strike is probably the single worst foreign policy promulgated by an American administration in the last twenty-five years, or even the last half-century, if one makes a very large exception for the “domino theory” and its entire progeny of policies. It’s probably even a worse idea than that of “mutually assured destruction.” \n\t  The war has gone on long enough. The further back one steps from it, the more it looks like Vietnam (Oh no! Taboo analogy!). American troops are battling against a whole slew of splinter groups and radicals who only employ guerrilla tactics with which the military still has trouble contending. Many scholars have made the argument recently that Iraq is so radically destabilized right now because of the American presence. That isn’t just a pretext for “cutting and running,” as the swollen rhetoric of the Bush administration would label it (or at least until they have their next policy meeting and elect a new phrase-of-the-month). Much of the fighting in Iraq happening right now is the work of hyper-nationalist groups operating from one very basic premise: get the Americans out of here. If America pulled out now, the country would stay messy for quite sometime, but if America stays then it will be a mess for even longer. \n",
        "\tIt is ridiculous that gay marriage is such a controversial topic in the world we live in today.  With soldiers dying thousands of miles from home in Iraq as part of a war that the nation is divided on, and other domestic topics such as whether abortion is murder or not, whether two people of the same sex decide to get married should not be that major of a concern.  However, since it is such a popular topic, that means in some way that people should decide what their opinion is on whether or not gay marriage should be legalized.  \n\tIn my opinion, if two people of the same sex think getting married is the right thing to do to make them happy, then let them do it.  It doesn’t matter what anyone else’s opinion is, this is America – home of the free.  This country was built in order for people to escape the oppression of other governments.  As the poem “The New Colossus” engraved on the Statue of Liberty declares, America calls to the world, “Give me your tired, your poor, / your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. / Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, / I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”  When our country embraces such an ethic, it seems unfair to deny two people a simple right that is based on love.  If we do deny them this right, then America has lost its identity as a haven for the oppressed.\n      President George Bush’s call for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is simply ridiculous.  First of all, we should have learned our lesson when we tampered with the constitution during prohibition.  Since we had to go right back and amend the constitution just for the sake of declaring the prohibition amendment invalid, the simple moral of thinking through what is or is not important enough to amend the constitution should have been made clear. Also, the Declaration of Independence famously states the American citizen’s right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”  Now, I do not pretend to be a scholar of political science, but if there is an amendment to ban gay marriage, there would be some officially documented contradictions in Washington, specifically regarding the “pursuit of happiness” clause.\n      Lastly, the federal government should not only not be involved in the issue of gay marriage, but they should not even care about whether two gay people decide to be married.  That is a private decision between two people that should be respected by the government.  The government should only be involved so much as to determine whether or not gay married couples get the same benefits as heterosexual married couples.  However, if gay married couples were denied the same benefits from the government as heterosexual married couples, then that would count as discrimination.  Discrimination of any kind by the federal government is inappropriate, so by logic gay couples should receive the same rights. \n",
        "\tThe war in Iraq cannot be boiled down to 500 words.\n\tFirst of all, Americans as a whole are entirely out of touch with what’s going on in all of the Middle East, not just in Iraq, but in Israel, Palestine, Iran, Afghanastan, and the rest of the region.  There are a multitude of reasons for this, and at the end of the day, the problem remains: we are so isolated from the actual conflict that we have become desensitized to its human dimensions.\n\tThe political angle on this war is what soaks up all the news time, because that’s what is marketable, and what keeps people tuned in.  It’s an easy cop-out for news producers to run a story saying “yeah, more people died in Iraq today, this means President Bush sucks!”.  To use the war in Iraq as political leverage on Capital Hill is absolutely selfish.  Are we really so egocentric that the only context in which we will discuss Iraq is in its domestic political ramifications?  I’m sorry, but our domestic woes pale in comparison to those faced EVERY DAY by Iraqi citizens.\n\tWhen I was a small child, I was afraid of thunderstorms.  Loud banging noises, wind, rain, and flashes of light.  It was scary!  My mom used to say “It’s okay, its just angels bowling.”\n\tOkay, if I had been born in Iraq (which could have just as easily happened, babies have no control over where they were born), I would have been scared of things like cluster bombs, machine guns, suicide bombers, and corrupt police.  That’s scary shit for a four year old growing up in the world.  After getting their houses blown to shit in a war, what types of convictions will that child be stuck with for life?  Even if it wasn’t Americans who inflicted violence their neighborhoods, the American invasion essentially threw a match into the political “oil barrel” (ironic, no pun intended) that existed in Iraq.  Now, in the subsequent power vacuum, thousands still don’t have commodities like electricity or running water.\n      I was afraid of thunderstorms when I was little, and I can only imagine how I would have reacted to operation “Shock and Awe” (fucking terrible name for a military campaign, come on, the rest of the world looks at operation ‘Shock and Awe’ and passes us off as a bunch of cowboys who don’t care about anyone but ourselves).\n      As a further measure of just how retardedly and cripplingly out-of-touch Americans are, look at the video game “Call of Duty 4”.  The game play and graphics are great, I’ll admit that.  The game developer likely spent millions of development of the game play engine and graphics.\n      This game is basically “Iraq the video game”.  I believe the Army and Marine Corps literally released Iraq the video game recently also.  ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?\n      I’m scared the NSA will read this and be like “oh that college kid, we should keep an eye on him, he disagrees with contemporary political directions!”, but I know that probably won’t happen, so I’ll just keep typing.\n      Iraq the video game?  Is this the type of society we have become?  The closest that the average American will ever care to get to the SUFFERING in the middle east is a video game, where the first level consists of riding through the Iraqi country side in an Apache helicopter and blasting the shit out of the country side with a cannon.\n      Consider this: hypothetically, let’s just say a video game developer in Iraq made “America the Video Game”.  Let’s say this game was IDENTICAL to “Call of Duty 4” in every way, in terms of weapons, game play, shooting, and the like.  Only the first level would be a firebombing of Manhattan, instead of Iraq, and the defenseless soldiers who you are blowing up would be American, rather than generic-middle-eastern-looking wearing random turbans.\n      HOW WOULD AMERICANS REACT?  We’d declare war on Iraq and probably nuke it, because we are just that myopic and near-sighted.  We would take it as an assault on our national pride, which it would be.\n      Well then, by insulting the entire middle east with “call of duty 4”, we have just continued to dig ourselves into the shithole we have been sinking into for several years.  This country is so screwed, we need to SERIOUSLY start making friends around the world, or we are going to be in waayyyy over our heads.  If that happens, I’m moving to Canada.\n",
        "In the terrorist attack of 2001, I lost many close friends and relatives. I live right outside the city so I was affected greatly. When this first happened I was in eighth grade and even at that age, I developed a prejudice against middle eastern people. I could not stand the sight of them. I got chills when I watched the news and the re-runs of what happened that day. When I first witnessed the attacks on the towers, the first thing that popped into my mind was war. I wanted to get revenge on the terrorists so badly. I can only imagine what President Bush thought that day. His people were attacked and killed that day for no reason. Of course he was mad, upset, angry and distraught. I think President Bush had the hardest job of all that day and they days after the attacks. My first decision, as his, would have been to go to war. Although this was a rash and irrational decision, I think it was necessary at the time. We could not just let the terrorists kill our friends and relatives and just stand there and watch. Something had to be done as a response to what they did. We had to at least try and stop them. President Bush’s only mistake, I think, was how long we ended up staying in and occupying Iraq. I think by staying in Iraq we are only killing more of our men and women and we are getting nothing done. And, what we have done, will fall apart the second we leave. Those people are just not able to function in a normal society. If they cannot get along with and work with each other, how are we supposed to organize rules and laws so that they can live in peace? I think the men of the middle east are the most ungrateful people. By occupying Iraq further, we are not making any progress. All we can do now is protect ourselves because we know that they will always be a threat because they hate the United States. Because I was affected so greatly that day, it is still hard for me to look at middle eastern people not be disturbed, scared, or angry. I think it is in our best interest to pull out of Iraq and try not to deal with them at all. As the war has shown, there is not much that we can do that will stay in place. If they cannot get along with each other, I don’t think anyone can expect President Bush to solve all of their internal problems. All he can do now is protect out country with all that he can. I think the men and women that are stationed in Iraq should return home and we should heighten security instead of trying to solve Iraq’s problems. I think that the government should focus on the United States’ gaps in security and problems. This is all that we can do. President Bush cannot create miracles.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Subject 15- GENDER DISCRIMINATION:  Do you feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the present-day United States?  If so, what can we do to change this?  Do you feel that women are ever discriminated against, in the workplace or otherwise?  Do you feel that men are ever discriminated against, in the workplace or otherwise?\n\n\n\tI do feel that there is gender discrimination is still a problem, but not always only with women, though this is probably the bigger area of discrimination. I know that for many jobs, most people feel like they would rather work under a man who holds a high position, because the thought is, is that women can not handle that type of pressure. It they do somehow make it past the glass roof, then they must be extremely uptight and unfriendly, all of which are stereotypes of course. The glass roof however, does exist unfortunately. \n\tThe glass roof is a saying that is used to describe how most often women, are able to see the position in a job career that they would like and want, but are unable to reach and obtain it due to outside causes. These outside causes are mainly their other coworkers of boards of offices who elect those who are to receive raises and positions. Also, in the area of payment, women who are doing the same jobs as their coworkers who are men, often receive less payment. This is utterly unfair, because the jobs are the same, and perhaps the women has to actually work even harder just to prove her \"worth\" to the outside would and her company. Again, gender discrimination is not solely reserved for only the women, it can be against the men as well.\n\tIf a man was to go into sales in selling dresses, the assumption is that they must be gay, and if they are not then they do not know what they are talking about. However, there are many men out there who have great opinion on dresses or even how to make clothes for women who are straight, and yet it is usually harder for them to gain the respect that they deserve. Perhaps this is because women feel men who are gay think more like them and thus are telling the truth, or have them in mind when designing the clothes, and straight men do not. This is again a stereotype that must be corrected, because men who are straight have just as much ability to do women's work or design women's clothes as anyone else. \n\tAnother place where women are discriminated against would be in sports. Many women are extremely good at sports, but men do not hold their teams as in high a regards as they do men's. This is utterly ridiculous, because like at some colleges, the women's team might be first in their division, while the men's team are loosing horribly yet still get more fans. This is quite unfair, and women's teams should start to gain and obtain the respect that they deserve, because they practice just as hard as the men's teams do. \n\tOverall, I feel that there is still discrimination, but that it all depends what line of work or field you are in to determine if it is against women or men. People should learn to be more respectful of both genders in any field, and could perhaps even learn new things from the opposite sex if society just allows them to teach us. \n",
        "\tThe ever-advancing technology of the 21st century raises many questions about the issue of privacy.  Essential to any debate over privacy rights is the knowledge that most modern means of communication are not secure.  The World Wide Web and all its information is accessible to anyone.  Whatever is posted on websites like Myspace or Facebook is no longer private material.  Users are warned that even their emails and instant messages are accessible to others.  Teachers have the same right as anyone else to browse the web, and therefore looking at a student’s myspace page is not an invasion of privacy.  \n\tPeople who create web accounts with sites like myspace are informed of the accessibility of the site, and the publishers of the site require that its patrons acknowledge and accept this fact.  If students fail to take into account the possibility of parents or teachers seeing the information that they post, it the students’ own fault.  \n      One of a school’s top priorities is the safety of its students.  The faculty and administration must take care to observe and acknowledge any threats to that safety.  As a student, personal privacy is much less important than general safety.  This is why school officials have the right to search desks and lockers.  All suspicions, accusations, and threats must be thoroughly investigated.  Too much violence has taken place at schools in recent years.  School is supposed to be a safe haven for children, a place where they can feel free to grow and learn.  Students cannot feel this way if they live in fear.\n      Not only is safety a top priority, but personal development of the students is very important as well.  Obviously if children are exhibiting violent tendencies, there are some problems in their life and issues that need to be worked out, and may require the experienced help of teachers and counselors.  My mother works in an elementary school in my town.  She told me about an incident that involved several seventh graders and information posted on myspace.  These students had formed a hate group targeting another student in the class.  The principal found out about it, and the students responsible for creating the group were reprimanded, though I am not sure how.  The principle went even further than this and called a meeting of parents to preach against the dangers of website like myspace that encourage kids to post a great deal of personal information about themselves on an unsecured, easily accessed medium.  This is a necessary step to take I believe, because children need know that there are many people besides teachers who will see their myspace pages, and the consequences may be much more dangerous than detention.\n      School is not the only place where security takes priority over privacy.  The U.S. government has, many times throughout its history, limited citizens’ right to privacy in favor of national security.  There is however, a very important difference with this particular school situation: by posting that bulletin on myspace, the student had no right to privacy to begin with.\n\t\n",
        "Privacy rights are a big issue in our nation today. Honestly, I am not sure why this is. I think it is because I am one of the norm. I am a white, catholic, American girl with absolutely nothing to hide. I do not believe that the government would ever want to invade my privacy. However, if they did, I trust my government enough to know that they must have had a valid reason for doing so and that it was for the betterment of the country, which I am all for, especially after the tragedy of September 11, 2001. My beliefs about privacy rights are as follows, if you do not trust your government to have valid reasoning for invading privacy, then you should leave. The government’s intention is only to protect you from potential danger or to keep you from endangering the country. This angers me so much when people do not agree with the government having access to some personal aspects of a citizens life. If you do not want the government invading your privacy, don’t do anything that would make them think that you’re going to endanger the country, that is not asking for much. The government has many other things to do and much more important things to do than to tap you phone call with you friend Jen about you plans for the weekend. What I am trying to say is that the government wont invade your privacy if you don’t give them a reason to. It is that simple. Like the school officials, that kid gave them a reason to suspect him of endangering the school and its students. I do believe that this was not an invasion of privacy because by putting that information on myspace, that kid no longer had any privacy. Myspace is a public network. I don’t believe anything on the internet is private. Invasion of privacy or not, the school officials made the right decision because they prevented a potential life threatening act. Who knows how many children and teachers could have been killed that day? Is this kids privacy really the top priority? I think that is ridiculous to even be thinking about that. I believe that the only reason the government should only invade privacy if they have reason to believe that that person is going to endanger themselves or someone else. I also think that I have these views because I am a part of the majority. If I was a teenage boy from Afghanistan I would probably have a different outlook on privacy rights. I think privacy rights and racial profiling however are two separate issues. And, unfortunately, because I was personally effected very much by September 11th, I do not have any problem with racial profiling. If it will promote the safety of our country then I do not have a problem with it. If they do not like it then they do not belong here. As harsh as that is, I do not believe that we should cater to anyone just because that would be abiding by their privacy rights. When it comes to national security, I believe that privacy rights do not matter at that point.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "\tGender discrimination is more commonly associated with the past, when peoples roles in life were defined by their gender.  Nowadays, it easier for women to hold professional positions, and there are men who run their households.  That is not to say, however, that the problem of gender discrimination has been eliminated.  While it is possible for people today to break through the boundaries imposed by gender discrimination, those boundaries still exist in a very real way.   Stereotypical gender roles are still prevalent, and women are often discriminated against in the workplace and in traditionally male settings.  There is also a less significant issue of men being discriminated against in traditionally female roles.  Overall, a lot of gender discrimination still exists in the present-day United States, to which there is no simple solution.\n\tSolving the problem of gender discrimination is no easy task.  It will of course take much to time to completely even out the expectations for males and females, and it may not even be achievable given the United States’ past history of unequal gender roles.  The best thing to do is to encourage men and women who take on positions and tasks typically designated for the opposite sex.  Only with widespread acceptance of such actions will they become the norm, which is necessary to eliminate gender discrimination.  It is important to try to separate a role from a gender, so that it becomes accepted for any role to be played by any individual regardless of gender, which is what it means to be free of gender discrimination.  There is a long way to go to solve the problem of gender discrimination, but hopefully the conscious efforts that people make to accept untraditional roles will contribute to the elimination of such a negative force that shapes society.\n",
        "I’m actually in the middle on this subject. I do believe that the Catholic Church does need to change it ways to be more accepting of all walks of life and not just some. Especially on topics like homosexuality and transgender relationships. Its hard for me to really listen to Catholic priests because I find them to be so superficial. Its like they say it’s a sin to do everything: to watch to much TV, to engage in sexual acts before marriage. I mean leave people alone its there life. Instead of trying to change people they need to look at themselves. Very few young people actually truly side Catholicism. It’s usually just a lot of old people. If the Catholic Church doesn’t get up to date with the teachings and they way they reach people they are going to lose a lot of young people to other religions or other harsher realities like drugs, and gang violence. \nThroughout my college career I have turned to God more than I ever have in my enter life. I went through a phase where I was fed up with the Bible, not necessarily God but of the teachings in the Bible. And that was because I had went to Catholic elementary school where the image I had of God was this domineering person who got mad at you when you did things wrong. And knowingly let bad things happen to you. Through college and with the help of my friends I have come to see God as friend, a non-judgmental friend. You can go to him when you have a problem and don’t have to worry about him yelling at you or belittling you. I can describe an experience in which I was I got in trouble at school and was about to receive serious consequences. I went into the Loyola Chapel and just cried and as I cried its like I felt a burden being lifted. I felt at that moment God was there taking in all of my sorrows and telling me to life my head up. Moreover, it was partly because of the Catholic Church that I felt that I couldn’t go to God and he wouldn’t accept me for all my flaws. \nMany people have said that there are Ten Commandments but one commandment is above everything else; to love each other as Jesus has loved you. If the Catholic Church turned to that commandment and began to teach about that commandment; about God’s undying love for each of us, I believe people would stop having such a negative attitude towards the Catholic Church.\nAs for their traditions of priests not being able to marry, well I believe they should keep it that way because of the reasoning behind it. Well I’m not sure of the theological reasoning but the reasoning I came up with is because it is in a human being’s nature to have sexual yearnings I believe that it is through Jesus that priests must pray to overcome that yearning. The sexual urge can be very strong so I believe that as priests continually turn to God to overcome that urge their bond becomes stronger.  \n\n\n",
        "\tFor me, gay marriage is a tough subject because I don’t really know how I stand on the issue. I was raised in a Christian home and have gone to church all my life, and homosexuality is very obviously against my religion and against what the Bible teaches. On the other hand, however, I have many good friends who are homosexual and I love them to death and would want them to be happy regardless of what I was taught to believe. So I guess I am stuck in the middle on this issue because I don’t agree or disagree with either side. Regarding the states that have legalized gay marriage, that decision is up to who ever is governor and if he legalizes it, then I see nothing wrong with that. The people who live in the state are the ones that elect these officials into office and they know beforehand where that person stands on gay marriage, therefore if a state decides to legalize it, that is their personal decision and since there is no country-wide law banning it, I don’t think that those living outside of the state have any grounds to argue. If you don’t agree with the laws of a state, then move or be an active participant in the next election so that your voice can be heard. \n\tIn my opinion Bush pushing for a constitution amendment banning gay marriage is relatively understandable. Being a republican and a conservative he obviously does not agree with gay marriage so the fact that he is trying to ban it is in no way surprising to me and should not be to anyone else. Considering that America was built on having faith in God, it makes sense that the laws of the country should reflect what is written in the Bible. However, since church and state has been separated, I do not know if that is a valid argument any longer. Overall, I do not think that the federal government should be involved in the issue because I think making a nation-wide law would do more harm then help. Also, but allowing each state to make their own decisions, it gives homosexuals hope to have a legally binding relationship with the person they love and also gives them a chance to experience what people in heterosexual relationships have experienced. \n\tFor me, this issue is not black and white and there is no right answer or wrong answer. I have been raised to believe one thing my entire life, and if you asked my parents or any of my church friends, they would say that gay marriage without a doubt should be illegal no questions asked, end of discussion. In all honesty, I don’t really agree with the homosexual lifestyle, but I do not judge people based on their sexual orientation. Regardless, everyone deserves the chance to be happy no matter whom they choose to love. Societal norms have changed greatly over the centuries, and it’s no surprise that they are going to continue to change, but before change happens, there is always controversy and conflict, but I guess that’s just part of the cycle.\n",
        "Subject Number 15\n\n1. WAR IN IRAQ:  The controversial war in Iraq has made news headlines almost every day since it began.  How do you feel about the war?  Do you think the war should continue or has it gone on long enough?\n\n\tI feel as if the war in Iraq has gone on long enough, though I do not see any graceful way out of the situation until its entire completion. We can simply not leave the country half done. Our efforts in organization then might be easily overthrown by the terrorists or groups that do not have all of the best interests in mind for the rest of country outside of their immediate group. We do not want to follow in the footsteps of Russia when they overtook Afghanistan and then just left half way through. The country was in great turmoil and was much worse off then before they were invaded originally. If we leave Iraq now, without following though, then all of our effort and blood shed would be in vain. \n\tOn the other hand, I feel as if there should be a faster way to end this war, or at least occupation of Iraq. I understand that we are allowing them to create their own government with us just monitoring them, yet do we really need to keep sending over more troops to oversea this monitoring? \n\tEvery day in the news we keep hearing stories of more soldiers shot or wounded, and it is quite clear that we are not wanted there. Again, I understand that we are at this point just aiding the military of the Iraq, and the police of the Iraq against the terrorists, but must we prolong our stay there for so long?\n\tIn the first place, we should not really even be here, because it was not even them that were linked to the terrorists groups that crashed into our twin towers. Osama Bin Laden was a harsh and cruel leader, but he was not really connected to our attack in any way. We used it as an excuse to attack his country, and capture him saying that he aided them and was harboring \"weapons of mass destruction,\" which was untrue. It was really our own government that was feeding us wrong information in order to have an excuse to go after personal endeavors and have an excuse for the rest of the united states people to back them up. \n\tI am ready for this war to finally end. I am ready for my friends in the military to come home, or not have to worry that they will eventually be sent over there, with a possibility to never return again. This war is drawing to a close, I know, but in my mind, this close is coming way too slowly. I hope that with our next election we will be able to have a president who is able to construct a clear and workable plan for exiting Iraq. I hope that this plan will be a safe and workable and cause worthy manner to justify our being over there and loosing so many lives. I hope that Iraq will appreciate the mess that we got into for them in the end and be our allies and not turn against us in the end. It would be awful to have a new country fully running after spending so many years there and investing so much of our effort into its soil to just have it turn around with its new government and destroy us.  \n",
        "\tThis is one issue that I am completely on one side.  Gay people should be allowed to marry.  There really isn’t a good reason not to let them marry.  Those who oppose it say that it would “compromise the family unit.”  Are you kidding me?  This is their main argument.  Can they see into the future and know that married gay people will destroy family life?  No.  They have no factual basis for their argument.  Gay people are perfectly capable of raising children, maybe even more so that heterosexual couples.  I say this because two gay people who want to have kids must overcome disapproval from society so much so that if they only kinda wanted kids, they would not do it.  Consequently they would most likely be excellent parents.\n\tThis issue only exists because of homophobes and the Catholic Church.  They have this idea that if gays are allowed to marry, Armageddon is sure to follow.  The truth is that the vast majority of people in this world are heterosexual.  The gay people aren’t going to take over the world.  They simply want to have the same rights as straight couples.  Gay people should not be punished for something they were born with.  It is perfectly natural to be gay, just as it is perfectly natural to have red hair.\n\tDo people think gay people want to be gay?  Who would want to put up with all the ridicule they must endure throughout their lives?  What if we were to say that straight biracial couples could not marry?  Doing such a thing would be out of the question.  I feel that it’s the same way with gay marriage.  There really is no difference from a normal marriage except that gay people cannot procreate.  So what?  This is where the Catholic Church gets involved.  They autocratically declare that God says it is necessary for married couples to have children.  God didn’t tell them anything.  He tells the pope, the priests, whomever, about as many things as He tells a frog.  The Catholic Church should limit themselves to matters of faith, because they have no physical proof or facts for anything, including the existence of God.  \n\tThe only reason people are opposed to gay marriage is that they’re homophobic.  Gay people aren’t out to hurt straight people.  They just want to share each others’ love through marriage.  We will look back 100 years from now and wonder how we could be so barbaric, forbidding two people to marry based on sexual orientation.  This is the most apparent form of civil rights today, bar none.  It’s outrageous that people are opposed to this.  This is like going back in time 2000 years ago, when women were not allowed to own land.  It’s ridiculous.  And the most frustrating thing about it is that it will not hurt the people who are so opposed to it.  Allowing gay marriage can only help people.\n\tGeorge Bush’s amendment is a clear violation of civil rights.  It is an abomination that such a thing can even be suggested in today’s government.  The federal government should get involved, and they should make it completely legal for two gay people to marry.\n",
        "\tGender discrimination is as much an issue today as racial discrimination, although it is not so negatively looked on.  Racial discrimination creates such responses as “What are you, some kind of racist?” or “That wasn’t funny, why would you say that?”  Gender discrimination is more commonly taken as a joke and so occurs much more frequently.  People talk all the time about how “the woman” shouldn’t be doing something physical or which requires a lot of strength, or make fun of women who take on traditionally male professions like mechanics or construction workers.  They say the woman wants to be a man, but nobody accepts that she chose the profession because it was just something that struck her personal interest.  In the same way, men who enter traditionally female professions like secretary or nurse are also made fun of for becoming effeminate, instead of respected for taking a job which requires a lot of hard work.\n\tI never noticed how much women are actually made to feel uncomfortable in the workplace until I started watching The Office, a comedy “documentary” series about life working in the sales office of a paper company.  All sorts of racist and sexist behavior that regularly occurs at much lower levels is exaggerated and brought out in the show, and because of the exaggeration it’s funny, but it makes you think.  If things like that never happened in the first place, there would be no basis for the show because it would be implausible.  Instead, people laugh because while the situations are so ridiculous, it is easy to see some of them happening in a real life workplace, or to identify them with a situation you or a coworker were once in.\n\tMen are also discriminated against in the workplace, but it is more on the basis of sexual orientation, age or race.  I can’t think of a situation where a middle class white male would ever really be discriminated against, unless he worked in an office run and populated by minority employees.  It is more of an issue when women are discriminated against than men, however, because men experience so much less discrimination on a regular basis.  Men can be denied from women’s clubs without an issue, but if an exclusively male organization is created you can be sure there are women somewhere protesting it.  While this is unfair and not the way to go about solving things, it is common practice in today’s society.\n\tIt is the responsibility of both women and men to resolve the issue of workplace discrimination.  Ground rules determining what is acceptable and what is not in the workplace have been set down, and punishments like sensitivity training put in place, that have been very effective.  Women should not have to “become” men, that is be cutthroat and ambitious, to get ahead in certain jobs.  Both sexes just have different ways of working and resolving work conflicts which should be respected.  Teambuilding exercises are a huge part of ending discrimination, but whether or not they work depends on the previous thoughts and views a worker had about people of the opposite sex.  Punishments should be stricter for repeated offenses, instead of just sensitivity training and perhaps an apology and a fine.  Companies tend to humor offensive employees way too much when they are high ranking on the management chain.  The problem needs to be cut off from above, and then lower level employees will see that their own behavior definitely will not be accepted and change.\n",
        "\tGender discrimination is not a huge issue in the present-day United States.  While it may have been a larger issue in the past half-century, it does not pose much of a problem to our society today.  In the modernized country we live in, which is the most ethnically spread country in the world, gender differences do not concern the common citizen.  Also, through my own experience, I have never witnessed a situation in which gender discrimination was evident. I have worked for the same company for three years, I have several women and men as bosses, and gender discrimination never occurred.\n\tWhether or not the common citizen of the United States today would consider gender discrimination a major issue, one fact always boggles me about the entire issue in general.  Men and women are inherently different. Therefore, it would make no sense if we were treated in exactly the same way. For instance, women do not typically play American football, as it is a very physical sport. Since there are a great number of differences between men and women, I would not call it discrimination to acknowledge those differences.\n",
        "\tAlthough gender discrimination is not nearly as big an issue as it has been in the past, I do feel as though it is still an issue in the present-day United States. Women have really moved their way to the top in today’s society. They are able to do pretty much all of the same things as men, such as hold high positions in jobs, become pastors and ministers, and are not obligated to stay at home and raise the family and take care of the house. Although a lot of gender discrimination is not vocalized in such places as the work place and in politics, its presence is still there. In such situations when women are competing against men for positions, men are typically more likely to get the position. Also, when women do hold higher positions over men, the men beneath her do not always respect her the way they should and sometimes undermine her authority. We know that gender discrimination is still prevalent because of its role in the media. I have seen a number of episodes of shows that focus on the inequities women suffer from in the workplace and how they are sometimes disrespected because of their gender. I also have many male friends who are quick to come up with gender related jokes that are meant to make fun of women and say that they are inferior to men. Regardless of whether or not they really feel this way, such acts show that women are not seen as equal in today’s society no matter what laws are written. It may be the law to treat women the same as men, but there always seems to be that underlying feeling in the back of society’s mind that says that women are beneath men. I do not feel as though men are discriminated against in the workplace because they created the workplace and typically run the work place. Most people do not look at a man and think that a woman would be better qualified for a position simply because she is a woman, but that happens to women all the time. \nAnd then there is the whole debate as to whether or not we will ever see a woman president. It seems the only way this will ever be accomplished is if women band together to make it happen. I am sure that most men in this country would not be thrilled with a woman becoming president and it almost seems as though it may never happen. I would be thoroughly shocked if this happened within my lifetime solely based on the mentality of today’s society.  I think the only way to change the discrimination that still prevails in today’s society is to change the way we think altogether. Discrimination will never go away unless that mentality of women not being the same goes away. It is not enough to make laws saying that women have the same opportunities as men, but people have to make a conscious effort to look past gender and look at what a person bring to the table and is able to offer. \n",
        "\tThe Catholic Church definitely needs to change its ways to adapt to the 21st Century.  Over the course of time the Church officials have blindly enforced traditions of the Catholic history to aim at, but not obtains, a higher means of humanity; a humanity where virtues such as humility and service, among others, flourish in a harmonious mankind.  While their aims may provide virtuous characters, virtuous because they are working towards such a high good and their actions along the way are thus better, the end is far from realistic.  Some of the means by which to obtain this good are also unrealistic in contemporary society.  \n\tBack in history, groups of people could and were pressure to use a good amount of their time for worship and the furthering of their own spirituality through religion.  Today’s world presses individuals to lead much more busy and multi-focused lives where it is hard to put so much focus, time, and devotion in to one practice.  Some of the Protestant churches, while stressing its importance, do not require a strict attendance schedule for all followers.  The Catholic Church is fairly strict about its once-a-week requirement to worship and this can be hard to accomplish today.  Additionally it seems as though this time where people should go to look for further spiritual development outside their everyday life is made empty and meaningless as it becomes a monotonous series of routines aimed at a blind goal.  \n\tAnother area where the Catholic Church needs to bring its views in to the contemporary society is science.  Many of the teachings and viewpoints on the church obviously came very early on in history; starting around 2000 years ago and going up through the middle of the second millennium.  During this time there was little explanation for unnatural occurrences, and even some natural occurrences, other than the supernatural.  Now with ever-evolving scientific theories, methods, and technologies, numerous parts of the natural world are now explainable and comprehensible.  \n\tOne example of science clashing with religion is evolution.  The church has the view where everything was created by God with the creation stories in Genesis.  Science, in recent times, has provided more and more convincing evidence towards the idea of evolution, or the idea that organisms modified their very being over time to survive better in their environments.  The Catholic Church is becoming very dated its strict beliefs and understandings of the world.  The Church needs to begin to broaden its perspective as scientific evidence and new technology gives us a greater understanding and means to explain the word around us.\n\tThe Church needs to open up more to increased medical sophistication and medical technology, especially as it pertains to the preservation of human life.  If the Church truly has the mindset that God put us on the Earth to enjoy his creation then why not also accept the means he gave us to live by and enhance our own lives.  I think sometimes the Church forgets that God gave us our minds which support and create all these new ideas and scientific knowledge which can help mankind.\n\n\n",
        "      This essay hopefully marks the last time I will ever need to argue about the War in Iraq.  Fortunately for me, everybody is beginning to agree with the point of view I have had since the start of the war.  Of course, this is unfortunate for our country, because if we had a legitimate reason for entering the country, and were fighting a just war, then we wouldn’t be the bad guys.  Unfortunately, we didn’t have a legitimate reason, and this war isn’t just.  Why did we enter in the first place?  I think the reasons the Bush administration have given: weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, Saddam as a threat to the world, have all been effectively ruled out.  Then what could it have been?  Oil?  Money?  Revenge?  It doesn’t really matter now.  Most of the world knows we were wrong, and most of the United States has accepted that, except unfortunately for the current administration, who of course are stubborn and stuck on staying in the country that we have no place being in.  Of course I feel like a hypocrite talking about the war, not ever having been in it, or even close to it.  Let me not then talk just of myself.  Recent polls have shown that 70% of our soldiers think we need to pull out within the year.  80% of Iraqis think we need to leave, and 2/3 of the world’s population agree.   If the people of the country we are trying to ‘help’ don’t want us there, then why in God’s name do we persist?  This can’t benefit us, with the number of American soldiers dying.  Perhaps a few businessmen and big businesses close to the Bush administration are benefiting, but that doesn’t really seem like a justifiable reason to stay.\n      But perhaps one shouldn’t just look at the negative aspects of our prolonged stay.  Maybe should look at all the good that has come from our occupation.  For example, look at all those kids growing up who really wanted to kill people and fire guns and all that fun stuff, but were always overwhelmed with a moral responsibility not to do so.  Well now all those masochistic oddballs have their chance! It’s not even illegal, and if they do a good enough job, they might get medals and tons of other benefits!  This is really a win-win situation, save for of course, the Iraqis they are killing.  But they are the enemy of course.  Well, except for all the innocent Iraqis they have been torturing and killing, at Haditha and Abu Ghraib and Ishaqi.  Oh and there’s that fourteen year old Iraqi girl that was raped and killed while her family was forced to watch.  But hey, isn’t it better for all those psychos to get their rage and their evil out on some other country than here in the United States?  And here’s another pro: look at it from the point of view of the terrorists.  What if after 9/11 the United States would have taken positive steps towards countering terrorism?  Then these poor terrorists wouldn’t have stood a chance, with the size of our military and all the nuclear weapons and high grade technology we have.  Now, because we’ve entered a country that really has no effect on the war on terror, Al Qaeda has a chance.  Recently discovered letters from Al Qaeda leaders actually claim that the longer the United States stays in Iraq, the more powerful Al Qaeda will become.  Yay!  I’m glad were doing so much to help terrorists.  However, some may be of the opinion that fostering terrorist organizations may be taking toleration a little too far.  I’ll leave that up to personal opinion, though.\n\n",
        "\tTo start off writing about gay marriage, let me talk a little about my personal feelings about homosexuality.  I don’t believe that anyone is meant to be homosexual.  To me, this makes no sense at all.  Male and females were given opposing genitalia for a reason, and that reason isn’t just for diversity.  Females and males are counterparts, made differently in order to ensure reproduction and the continuance of the human race.  If the same gender was meant to be together, there would be a natural means for reproduction.  And I’m sure there are some cases in nature when homosexuality, even asexuality and other strange forms of reproduction exist and completely legitimate.  However, I just don’t see this in humans at all.  So what is homosexuality then?  I believe it’s no more than a chemical imbalance in the brain.  Too much of one hormone, not enough of another. . .there have been definitive studies confirming that the actual brains of homosexuals are different, and more closely related to the brain of the opposite sex.  Some may see this as proof that homosexuals are born to be gay, but I see this is just a simple problem that can be fixed.  While most homosexuals would refuse to believe that their homosexuality is a “chemical imbalance” and see their homosexuality as something that makes them special, I think it is no more than a mutation that should eventually be wiped out of the human race due to homosexual’s inability to reproduce.  While this view is probably offensive towards gays, it is to me the most logical explanation for their unnatural actions.\n\tKeeping this in mind, I have absolutely no problem with gay marriage.  While I don’t think gay marriage is right, it’s none of my business what the homosexuals do.  They can have all the gay sex they want and get married and whatever else might please them as long as this has no effect on me, which it logically shouldn’t.  So whose business is it?  Why, the church of course!  Isn’t that where marriages happen?  And if it is not a marriage in the church, then wherever they choose to get married.  It should be up to the institutions that perform marriages to decide.  If a church or institution determines that they will not allow gay marriage, then so be it.  But gays should be allowed to go to a different institution that believes similarly and get married.  And who above all else should have no say about this?  Why, the president of course.  President Bush’s proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage infuriates me like no other.  The constitution, which is a document that ensures undeniable rights to all humans, has no place for articles denying liberties.   Honestly, why in God’s name would the president try to defile such an important and groundbreaking piece of history with such a silly and ridiculous amendment such as the one he is proposing?  The only reason he himself is against same sex marriage is because of his religion, which should hold no say in government!  Why does he think he can impose his specific religious views on an entire goddamn country?  I can’t talk about this anymore I’m so infuriated.\n\n",
        "\tI do not think gender discrimination is as much of a problem as it used to be, but it certainly still poses a problem in the present-day United States.  Whether the issue is occupation, political representation, or academic representation, among others, there is certainly still room for improvement.  One of the dangers of the discrimination that still exists today is that it is underlying and not necessarily out in the open like the issue used to be.\n\tOne way to fix the problem is not just recognize the group with a disadvantage (the women), but also have the group with advantages recognize those unearned privileges.  This interesting idea struck me the first time I heard it because it presents a completely new side to an ongoing historical issue amongst the genders.  So, to use this idea in a way that can help fix gender discrimination, males must understand that certain privileges they have are just that, privileges.  Many things have come unearned due to gender discrimination and a seemingly unconscious notion to favor males in the United States.  If these unearned advantages can be recognized as taking place, then action can be taken to offset them and act in fairness or justice when future issues present themselves.  \n\tWhen looking at the make-up of the corporate population in the United States it would certainly prove evidence enough that women are still being discriminated against.  The rate of discrimination, however, has dropped significantly and the numbers are starting to make a turn for the better.  Discrimination is something that will not be fixed over night; representation for females in the corporate world can not be immediately put to equilibrium.  Certainly if statistics are analyzed over the past decade or so, they would show a rise in the number of females taking on upper-level executive positions within companies.  This is evidence that discrimination did exist but is in the process of being fixed.  \n\tI do feel men are discriminated on from time to time as almost all individual is at some point in his or her life.  To help fix or mend the discrimination against females in the past, there are many companies partaking in a form of affirmative action.  In this situation, if there were a male and a female being considered for the same position, the job would go to the female if the qualifications were similar.  In this case men are certainly being discriminated against but that is necessary in order to fix decades, if not centuries, of gender discrimination against females.  \n\tAdditionally, I think men are discriminated against just as much as other groups in society.  Stereotypes do exist about men jut as they do about women, other ethnicities, or age.  I do not think, however, that these stereotypes that some hold about the male gender and use as a form of discrimination have affected men the way women have been affected.  Certainly the affects of discrimination against females are much more noticeable in the workforce and beyond.\n",
        "\tSaying that students have rights that need to be protected is like saying that the sky is blue. Young people have the same rights granted under the constitution that adults (in most cases anyway; drinking, voting, and some financial concerns being different). These rights aren’t shed at the schoolhouse gate, as one Supreme Court Justice noted. This doesn’t mean that administrators can’t take reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of the entire student body, though. \n\tAnother major issue of concern is that of the nature of the internet itself, which is one that American courts will be increasingly forced to confront in the next decade. Questions of whether the internet a completely public forum, how much personal information can be considered protected, as well as other issues related to copyright, fair use, and financial dealings all will need to answered more explicitly.\n\tIn this particular case, however, I think tat school administrators acted within reason. Myspace is an open forum. Placing information there is like tacking a note up on a billboard. To expect that someone out in Wichita can post information on it and that someone else in Bangladesh doesn’t have the right or the ability to access that information is ludicrous. The student who exposed his plans in such an obviously public place had it coming; to do something like that can only be labeled sheer stupidity. There are ways to post private information on the web that only one’s friends and other pre-approved persons can access, and Myspace is just not one of them. In fact, it is an internet phenomenon that encourages voyeurism, in every sense of the word. Parents should be glad that school administrators are checking out their kids myspace pages, and not forty-year-old pedophiles (and hope that administrators don’t fit both classifications...).\n\tThe line administrators should draw needs to make the medium of communication its primary focus. Posting on a public forum, announcing things in the lunchroom, and hanging banners in the hallway are all forms of communication that administrators can, and sometimes should, check. Writing in private online journal (which Myspace isn’t), sending e-mails to friends, and phoning other people are not acceptable forms for them to check. The difference lies in what can reasonably be considered a public form of communication. If I call down the hallway to my friend Bob, who’s at his locker, that I’ve contracted mono, syphilis, or something else I would reasonably want to keep to myself, then I can’t prevent others from hearing. But if I call Bob and explain it to him, then there’s no way another person has the right to overhear it. The same holds true for the internet, despite it being written down instead of spoken. If I go to an on-line forum and post, “I think I’m going to wake up tomorrow, eat breakfast, and then go slaughter sixteen people and several small dogs,” then of course I’m going to b arrested. That would be the equivalent of me shouting it at school football game. Common sense is always a must.\n",
        "\tFirst off, I don’t feel that this issue was a matter of invasion of privacy, but more of an issue of noble cause.  The person who posted the bulletin obviously wanted someone to see it and probably wasn’t thinking of the consequences of doing so.  They posted the bulletin on a public server and allowed at least some of their friends to see this.  In doing so they threw out any claim they could possibly have that this was an invasion of privacy and deserve what they got not only for their cause but also for their lack of consideration of where they were putting this information.\n\tHowever, I do believe that there are many areas that the school officials should learn to draw the lines on the issue of privacy.  When it comes to issues of security like the one mentioned in the question, schools have every right to question the student involved.  The only complication in this could arise about their methods to find this information.  If it is written in a notebook in the student’s private bedroom and the school requires the parents to do a random search based on how the student behaves or dresses, then the issue of privacy comes into play.  If it is posted on an online server that can be accessed by many people, privacy is not an issue.\n\tI guess the line really needs to be drawn on when schools begin to assume the worst based off of minor things such as dress.  Different styles provoke different judgments of people.  There are trends such as “emo” and “gothic” that really include just a bunch of kids who share similar tastes in music, art, etc, and only dress that way to draw attention to them or make others see them as different.  It’s been my personal experience (from an event that happened several years ago), that the ones that are truly hiding some of these qualities can be the most normal looking people.  Searching people or questioning people for these reasons alone is an invasion of privacy and not much better than searching or questioning them because of the color of their skin.\n\tSchool officials need to learn to make it their business to find true signs that someone may be thinking about going on a rampage rather than rummaging through that students hobbies and favorite bands, violating them on the basis of their appearance and taste.  This will not only prevent intrusions on that student’s privacy, but also help to root out possible threats to the safety of other students.\n\tThe real issue of privacy comes down to when the school assumes that they know too much about a particular type of person and goes into their business for that reason alone.  Any threat that is posted somewhere that multiple people can read about it can and should be silenced.  Since the use of a public server was used to host the message, the student really has no claim that the school taking action is an invasion of privacy.\n",
        "\tWhat exactly is marriage?  Is it harmonious monogamy proscribed by God?  Is it a collection of tax and financial benefits?  Who can define it?  Is it up to the federal government, or is it up to state legislatures?  Is it up to municipal clerks and judges?  Does the full faith and credit clause of the constitution apply when “activist judges” alter marriage’s basic definition?  Does it always have to be amongst a man and a woman?\n\tThese questions, and more, are among the hangnails which plague today’s gay marriage debate, and slowly distract our political system from addressing objectives which are much more important.  Many “religious righters” see homosexual marriage as a harbinger of the apocalypse, and carry on a “moral crusade” (more like a “moral charade”) against it.  To them, the definition of marriage (as between a man and a woman) shant be changed, for if it changes, society will fall apart at the seams!\n\tMany of them extend the effects of gay marriage, rhetorically, to entirely new realms of being.  “Well, if men can marry men, and women can marry women, then how long is it before people start marrying horses?  Sheep?  Inanimate objects?  Washing machines?”.\n\tThere isn’t really much merit to these questions.  The one respectable assertion which “homo haters” have left is that of their personal values.  To many, the idea of homosexual marriage is deeply offensive, and shocks the moral conscience.  To many, it contradicts their dear religious values to the very core.  This is perfectly acceptable, and for this reason, I do not think that “gay marriage” is a good idea.  We can’t allow homosexual couples to join in a relationship called “marriage”, for if we do, these people will go beserk.\n\tIndeed, homosexual “marriage” is unacceptable.  However, nobody is asking the government to force church doors open.  Nobody is asking for legislation which would require specific faiths to recognize gay marriages.  This would be a catastrophic collision of church and state.\n\tRather, we should extend the state-offered benefits of “marriage” to homosexual couples.  They don’t have to actually stand on a catholic alter before a catholic priest, but, they should be able to do some sort of paperwork which secures them the legal advantages afforded to married couples.  Lets call it something else besides marriage – civil union, enjoining, magic pony ceremony, whatever, it really doesn’t matter what we call it, as long as it isn’t marriage.\n\tBy removing marriage from the religious realm and highlighting solely its legal advantages, we remove the religious argument from the sphere of relevancy.  After all, things like hospital visiting rights, spousal tax benefits, and mortgage co-signing were NOT proscribed by god, do not appear in the bible, and thus, don’t need to be safeguarded by the religious right.\n\tWe should allow homosexual couples to enjoy these benefits without affording the religious right the luxury of having something to whine about.  I can’t see any reason why this isn’t a good objective.  I think I’m pretty close to 500 words now.\n",
        "\tI believe that gender discrimination is absolutely still an issue in the United States today. A few years back, I was writing a paper, and as research, I wad required to find the mean salaries for white men and white women. The difference was jarring: even though our higher academic institutions are now more female than male, white men still made an average of $10,000 more a year than white females ($40,000 to $30,000) the difference between black men and black women is also $10,000 dollars, $30,000 to $20,000). Thus, even though more women are getting degrees than men, it means that either men are making more for the same jobs, or that men are holding more higher paying jobs than women- and a quick glance into a corporate board room across the country will tell you that the latter is most definitely true. \n\tAnother area where it is easy to see gender discrimination against females is in the ongoing debate about whether or not Hilary Clinton has what it takes to be the next president. Almost every article is prefaced with the question “is America ready for a woman president?” There mere fact that this question has to be asked is a pretty glaring example of very blatant gender discrimination. The insinuation, of course, is that a woman brings something different, something perhaps inferior, to the table than a man does. \n\tOf course, discrimination can certainly swing both ways. There are certain professions that men still get strange looks for taking. You don’t see many male hairdressers, or many male nurses (the movie “Meet The Parents”) comes to mind when Robert DeNiro makes fun of Ben Stiller’s character for being a male nurse). If anyone admits to being a hairdresser or a male nurse, he’ll often be asked, well, why? And there’s always an underlying insinuation that maybe, he’s gay- which, of course, in our culture is emasculating.\n\t Gender discrimination is alive and well in America. It’s seen in the discrepancy in salaries between men and women, it’s seen in the popularity of men’s sports over women’s sports, and it’s seen in the fact that this country has not had, in 200 years, a single serious female candidate for president- even though many European countries have long since had female presidents or prime ministers. There are cases, too, of male discrimination, but the issue is much less serious, and often comes from jobs that are viewed as too “feminine.” \n\n",
        "      I do feel that in some ways, the Catholic Church needs to change in order to adapt to life in the 21st century.  I do, however, completely understand the reasoning that some people would have who would be opposed to this change.  But for those who would say something along the lines of the following, I disagree:  “The Catholic Church should not need to change its ways to adapt.  What is happening is that people are just drifting further away from the Church.  Yes, the world is changing, but that just means that we need to hold stronger to the truths and ways of the Church.”\n\tI disagree with the above reasoning because I believe that many of the “laws” of the Catholic Church were made merely by humans who were looking to further the Catholic Church politically, not to enhance the spiritual lives of its followers.  For example, if you look at the example of not eating before receiving Holy Communion, you see that this rule has change over the years.  A couple of decades ago, pre-Vatican II, you were not allowed to eat anything from around late Saturday night until after church on Sunday morning so that your body would be empty and ready to receive the body of Christ.  Now, that rule has been changed to be that you should refrain from eating approximately one hour before receiving communion.  Who came up with either of these “rules” and who changed them?  Humans.  I do not feel that I am lacking spiritually because I can eat closer to the time of communion than, say, my parents, who when they were younger had to follow the earlier rule.  Many trivial rules such as this deter people who were raised as Catholics but not choose not to practice their religion.  \n      From my personal experience, and from talking to other people, I get the impression that with all of the rules and regulations, many people adopt an “all or nothing” approach; if they don’t feel that they can play by all of the rules, then they figure why bother.  Because of this, I feel that the Catholic Church is losing members.  Many people are raised Catholic, but do not actively participate in the Church once they get to the age where their parents no longer force them to attend mass.  I believe that if some of the rules were adapted to the 21st century, then maybe more people would play an active role in the Church and truly practice the Catholic faith.  \n      Regarding the issue of allowing priests to marry, I think that they should be allowed.  As a member of the congregation, it is sometimes difficult to connect with the priest because he leads a life that is so different from your own.  Were priests allowed to marry, they would have much more in common with their parishioners and could better reach them spiritually as a result.  I think that if priests were allowed to marry, this might prevent some of the instances of pedophilia.  I think that in many cases, some of the men who are priests today became priests during an era when homosexuality was not as openly accepted as it is today.  If they did not want to marry, another option for men was to become a priest, because this avoided the question of why you were not getting married.  However, some of these men had built-up sexual tension, which they took out inappropriately on children of the church.  \n",
        "Honestly, the War in Iraq has become old news. This idea of going into Iraq and hurting them for what they had to the Americans was good right after 9/11 when everyone’s emotions were going hay wire. But now its overdone. War in Iraq who? I do think that they should make a decision about if they are going to being the troops back to the U.S. I haven’t heard about anything constructive that they war is doing. \nI believe that the U.S. is trying to make Iraq a middle-eastern-U.S. they want them to establish a democracy just like us. I do remember hearing the U.S. give Iraq a time limit on coming up with a constitution. That I feel is wrong, I mean look how long it took for the U.S. to come up with our constitution. The U.S. is pressuring Iraq and trying to turn it into something its not. Although I don’t agree with the brutality, lack of education, and subordination of women in Iraq, the U.S. has got to realize that there are years of tradition there that they are trying to break down in just a few years. No one is going to give that up, that what how Iraq was established. I guess you can say I’m hoping for the best of both worlds. I do want the U.S. troops to come home because they are members of families that miss them and don’t want anymore of them to die but look what President Bush did. He went into an already unstable country and left it even more unstable, with no schools, and no resources. They also left a sense of fear in the Iraqis, you see on the news children with guns fighting for some cause, and even women carry guns. Although that was probably there before we got there, I feel that it has increased because of our appearance in Iraq.\nAlso with the removal of the troops comes more hatred towards the U.S., which scares me as a citizen. Moreover, I feel that the U.S. should stay in Iraq and develop some type of friendship or alliance between the two nations. Because I don’t want to see Iraq go down hill from here and I don’t want to see them to any more terrorist acts towards them. I have heard that Bush’s main worry is large amounts of oil that we would gain either by colonizing Iraq or by having an alliance with them. Once again I believe Bush has his own interests at heart, he needs to regain focus on the Iraqis and stop thinking so big. \n",
        "\tThis issue of the student who posted a MySpace bulletin and claimed invasion of privacy has irked me since we first started discussing it.  What I don’t understand is perhaps simply about MySpace itself.  I have never been a member of this site, but I have been on it at various times in order to see a friend’s profile or perhaps to check out a music group that have their own page.  From that point of view, what I understand about the site is that it is very public.  Any person can view anyone’s profile and read their messages and blogs.  Now if this is truly the aim of the site, then I don’t understand how this can be considered an invasion of privacy in any way.  Writing that you’re going to kill someone and posting it on a website where anyone can freely read it is akin to walking out in the middle of the street and shouting the same thing.  If the intent of the writer was to keep something private, then why on earth would he post so that anybody and their mother could read it?  For me the majority of the argument of what is invasion of privacy is based on the intent of the “victim.”  Most people, for example, don’t want strangers walking around their house, or government officials looking through their things for no reason, thus we have laws against trespassing, breaking and entering, and unlawful entry for police officers.  This is the same reason that we have locks on our doors: because the house is a private place.\n\tNow most people understand that the home is a very private place and don’t disregard other’s privacy rights without understanding the consequences of their actions.  However, the internet is relatively uncharted terrain.  It’s hard legally to prove what is private and public on the internet, and what is infringement of privacy rights.  However, I don’t personally feel like there should be any grey area, and this is determined by what is viewable by the public.  If you are talking online in a chat group, then anyone is free to join that chat group and talk.  However, if you are having a one on one conversation on instant messenger, no normal person without any hacking abilities or tools could read your conversation besides the two of you.  So if someone does, that’s an invasion of privacy.  If you create a MySpace page that any member of the public can see, then viewing this page to potentially stop a crime is acceptable.  However, if one creates, let’s say, a facebook page, where privacy options allow the profile to only be shown to those whom the user chooses, then an ordinary person without these privileges would be invading one’s privacy by viewing their page.  Of course, however, if the page is shown to this person by a “friend” of yours on this program, then this is simply a case of trusting the wrong people, and since you did make your page public to this person, it is no invasion of privacy (legally) for this person to display it for the entire world to see.  This is the same as having a telephone conversation with another person.  It’s an invasion of privacy if without consent of either party someone else listens in.  However, if one of the two people having a telephone conversation turns around and informs the police of the entire conversation, there is no legal recourse.\n\n",
        "Essay 3\nI have two thoughts on gay marriage. I do believe that everyone has every right to be with the one they love. However, because it is against church teachings, I do not understand why they are making such a big deal out of calling it marriage. Marriage is a sacrament between a man and a woman. It is an eternal bond that they share. You also have to look at it from the perspective of a catholic as well. If God loves everyone the same and treats us all equally, why wouldn’t he accept a gay couple? I think that He would accept them, but because the laws of marriage were meant solely for procreation in the time of Jesus, this is just another reason that the church must alter laws to keep up with the times. I know a gay man who has a significant other. They want desperately to be married. I asked them what they thought and he said “It’s not like if we get married, the whole world is going to become gay and there will be no more procreation.” I agree with this. Also, with the number of gay marriages increasing, maybe there will be an increase in the rate of adoption around the world which is a very good thing. Children could have two parents that love them and all the opportunities in the world. President Bush’s law against gay marriage is ridiculous. First off, I do not think this is any of the government’s business. Honestly, what do they care if gay people are getting married? They should be worried about other issues such as health care, education, poverty in the US and the war in Iraq. Gay marriage is an issue between the homosexuals of America and the Church that is in its very early stages. I believe the church has to alter some teaching, yes, but I think that, to compromise, marriage should stay between a man and a woman and gay marriage should be called something else since it obviously is not an eternal, sacred bond between a man and a woman. This is an issue that is going to be fought over for a very long time since it is fairly new of a topic. Homosexuals are just as much a part of the Unites States as we are and they deserve every right that we have. Which I believe they do. In regards to the church, I think there is a lot more sensitivity because homosexuality was not seen as a norm when the laws were being made. Hopefully, with time, like most other controversial issues, this will be resolved and maybe gay marriage will be seen as more of a normal thing. Personally, I am for their rights and I would like to see them be just as happy and get to experience married life and family life just like every other heterosexual couple. It is a very special experience and if you can find that person, whether it be a man or a woman, then I believe you should spend the rest of your life with them.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "      The war in Iraq is certainly a very controversial issue indeed.  Honestly, I am not even sure exactly how I feel about it.  I do not believe that I know enough about the current situation or about the whole history of the situation to truly make a decision.  I would like to be more knowledgeable about current events such as this, but I don’t watch the news or read newspapers enough.  One thing that I do feel about the war is that I would like it to end as soon as possible.  I would like our troops home and safe.  Too many innocent lives have been lost already.  I am, however, very supportive of our soldiers.  \n      I also feel that since the United States intervened in Iraq and basically eliminated whatever political structure existed in Iraq, it is up to us to finish what we started.  It would not be fair for us to go in, knock out whatever form of government existed (no matter how tyrannical or harsh it was) and then just leave the Iraqi people to clean up the mess that we made.  So while I would like for our troops to be able to come home soon, I do see the need for us to remain to keep peace while the new democratic government gets on its feet.  I just don’t want us to stay longer than is necessary.  This war has gone on long enough.  \n      As far as the start of the war goes, I am not sure if I feel that we should have gone there in the first place.  After the events of September 11th, I could definitely see the reasoning and the logic behind the war in Afghanistan:  our nation was terrorized and attacked and we wanted to find the people responsible for that.  It would have been very odd if we had not done something in response to the attack on September 11th.  However, the war in Iraq is not directly related to September 11th.  After the terrorist attacks, naturally our country was on the watch for anything that might pose a threat to our safety.  Security everywhere was heightened.  When news came out that Saddam Hussein might have weapons of mass destruction, obviously we were very concerned.  We did not just want to stand by and wait until these weapons could possibly be used against our country.  On the other hand, we wanted to exercise diplomatic ways of going about it first, before just starting a war.  But Iraq would not allow the United Nations officials to search the country for the weapons.  This made us even more nervous.  We didn’t want to wait.  We tried to get approval before just going in, but this led to the whole issue with France.  \n      This is where I am confused on whether or not it was the right decision to wage war on Iraq without the consent of the United Nations.  This is also where many anti-Bush people bring up the issue of oil, stating the Bush just wanted to get oil and that that was the primary motivation for going into Iraq.  What I can think of, is that if we had not gone into Iraq and it turned out that they did have weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein sold to terrorist organizations which then attacked us, we would be very sorry and would be wishing that we had done something as a preventative measure.  It just seems like a huge shame that so many lives have been lost along the way.  \n",
        "\tThe war in Iraq, while aimed at respectable purpose has drawn on for too long and has become detrimental to the United States of America as well as the citizens of Iraq.  The aim of the war, on the surface anyway, is to enable to people of Iraq to escape the reigns of a harsh tyrannical ruler and experience the freedom and liberation of a democratic government.  Some feel, and I tend to think there is a hint of truth in this assumption, that George Bush’s involvement in the war stems at least partly from an ongoing family feud between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein.  \n\tThe war should have ceased after the ruler was taken from power and other insurgents and accomplices of the reign were effectively removed from their positions.  The war seems to have run on aimlessly at this point, forgetting the purpose, and failing to empower the people of Iraq.  There comes a point when the Iraqi citizens need to take power back for themselves, and I think that point has come and gone.  The United States is seeming less and less like a helpful friend to Iraq and more and more like a force on a wild, uncontrolled path towards making some political statement world-wide.\n\tEven back in the United States the war seems to cause nothing but negative effects economically and socially.  Soldier after soldier is dying for what has become a useless and drawn out cause.  It is ridiculous to think that the perpetual nature of the war is a just trade for the lives of American soldiers.  The point has been made that we want to spread democracy, and certainly there is great truth and cause in that pursuit.  The war, however, made that point a long time ago and now more and more soldiers continue to lose their lives.\n\tEconomically speaking, this war has cost the country billions and billions of dollars.  There are certainly more worthy causes for our country’s money on the home soil.  Poverty is one example of war we are trying to fight on our home turf right now, and that eighteen billion or so dollars that has been spent on the war would go a long way to aid those in need here.  We are spending an excess of money on foreign soil to aid foreign citizens when there are American who need help from all of those funds.  I do believe the spread of democracy is a just pursuit but, as I have mentioned, that purpose has long since been declared, achieved, and passed.  Democracy back in our own country calls for the aid of millions in poverty, and their cries should not go unnoticed because that is part of the democratic system.\n\t The other issue with the war in Iraq is the prioritization it was given over the war on terrorism.  Saddam Hussein was not the one that attacked our country and killed thousands of our citizens on September 11, 2001.  If we are to pursue any type of war our efforts would be more just when aimed at the end to terrorism.\n\n",
        "\tI believe that gender discrimination is still an issue in the present day United States for both men and women. I feel that women and men are equally discriminated against in the workplace. Discrimination has existed for so long in our country, I do not feel that it will be easy to rid ourselves of it. People have created their ideas and views and do not want to change them. When faced with the issue, people seem to turn their head or look the other way. \n\tYes, to an extent I do believe that there is gender discrimination in the work place. I believe that some people are set in their ways and feel that men can do a better job in a certain profession than women. I also believe that some people feel women can do a better job than men in a certain profession. I do not think that we can change this, because people will view the world the way they want to view it; it is very hard to change a persons view when they are set in their ways. Another point to this issue is that yes men and women are equal, but there are some jobs that men will do better in then women and vice versa. I do not believe this is an attack on the genders, but reality. \n\tFrom my personal experience at a job, I saw that women were treated better then the men. The women were treated as if they could do no wrong. The boys were reprimanded for when they did something wrong, even if a girl did the same thing and was never spoken to. My job was a part time job, it wasn’t serious, and so I do not know what it is like in the corporate world. Movies will portray discrimination in the work place for both sexes. I almost feel that the media “plays up” this discrimination. \n\tI do not really know what we could do to change this. I mean, how do you go about changing cultures norms and they ways things have been?\n\tGender discrimination does not seem to affect women as much as it used to, as we hear stories about the women in the corporate world, and husbands at home. The changing roles have become a topic of discussion in the 21st century- things are changing on their own. \n\t\n",
        "      During the summers of 2005 and 2006, I worked for a real estate company named Re/Max American Dream. A description of my job consisted of  answering telephone calls and setting up appointments for real estate agents to show homes on the market. Another title for this “Desk Management” job, as I liked to call it, would be a secretary. With the world as it is today, being an eighteen year old male who has a job as a secretary is not something to brag about. My reasoning for not wanting to admit to being a “secretary” is solely because of how society today looks upon the stereotypical job and description of a secretary. The public does not see a typical secretary as a hegemonic alpha male, but instead as a woman- the exact opposite of me. Since stereotypes have embedded themselves deeply into today’s society, I believe that gender discriminations are a huge portion of the present day United States.\n\n\tA typical stereotype for a woman consists of cooking, cleaning, and being weak whereas a male’s stereotype would be “macho,” loving sports, etc. These stereotypes are tied into the workforce, and sometimes determine whether a man or woman receives a job or not. The three types of jobs in the world today are stereotypical male jobs, stereotypical female jobs, and jobs for both sexes. An example of each may be a bouncer, a maid, and a pharmacist. If a random person was asked to pick which of these jobs were typically assigned to males, females, or both, the person would most likely get all of their decisions correct. Some jobs such as in construction require strength, and since males are naturally stronger, the majority of construction workers are men. When picturing a stereotypical maid, one could possibly think of the “French maid outfit.” There is no version of this outfit for men, because the job used to specifically be for women. Nothing is stopping a male or female from doing a job typically assigned to the opposite sex, but the reason that many people do not partake in this switch is because of the ways they were brought up. The entire world sees the jobs on television done by stereotypical people. Not only television, but media and other parts of society influence our take on gender and how we perceive it.\n\n      There have been little girls who like Thomas the Train, or little boys who “want to be a mommy” when they grow up. Gender definition doesn’t set into children’s minds until about the age of 5. It is at this point where they realize that stores do not sell clothing for everything they like, or toys that they want to play with specifically for their interests. It is at this age where boys start to play with G.I. Joes, and girls start to play with Barbie dolls, etc. Since before the United States existed, gender has always had its specific definitions for males and females. Everyone is brought up this way, and have been in past years. For this reason, mothers and fathers pass their views onto their children and so on. These children become heads of companies which then produce these stereotypical male or female toys based upon their views of gender. These toys further influence America’s view on gender to make the idea more steadfast as time goes on. The way to get rid of gender discrimination is to bring children up without gender-specific toys as mentioned above. Children would then play with whatever they want, and become and act how they were meant to act- without being influenced by society. Society has created America’s views on gender, and will not stop unless the next generation is brought up neutrally.\n29\n\n",
        "      Privacy is a right that many people in America feel belongs to them.  Unfortunately, the Bill of Rights has no provision for a right to privacy.  Privacy is something that many American citizens assume belongs to them, but in fact, privacy is not protected under the law, and is not considered a fundamental right in the Bill of Rights.  While it may be unethical to invade privacy in some situations, there are certain cases in which invasion of privacy is necessary to maintain the safety and security of American citizens.  In matters of national security, it is perfectly acceptable to invade privacy to explore a potential threat to the people of the American nation.\n\tThere is much debate over what is an acceptable invasion of privacy and what is not.  Any invasion of privacy for the purpose of exploring a possibly subversive act is acceptable because it is done with good intent, for the well-being of people.  Invasions of privacy that do not involve a serious matter should not go on. It is unethical to invade a person’s privacy without good reason, and the only good reason is if that person is suspected to be hiding something that could possibly harm others.  Privacy is a courtesy that others should be afforded when possible, but it is perfectly fine to invade it when necessary for the protection of others.\n\tWithout necessary invasions of property, it is possible for things to go awry and for major consequences to result.  Serious damage can be caused by threats that go unchecked and blossom into events that endanger human lives and prosperity.  Every day, countless subversive acts are prevented, thanks to the people who work in the field of national security.  Much of this national security work involves recording phone conversations, tracking emails, and investigating suspicious activity, any of which could be construed as an invasion of privacy.  Without these invasions of privacy, however, our nation would be subject to extremist plots and harmful attacks.  It is far better to invade some people’s privacy than to risk the safety and well-being of an entire nation.  Those who wish to maintain privacy rights unconditionally need to realize that their request comes at a cost of human lives.\n",
        "The Catholic Church most definitely has to adjust to the changes of the present day. Society was very different in the time of Jesus than it is now. Women now have rights and society places a heavier emphasis on different things and issues than the people of Jesus’ time did. I do not understand the why priests cannot marry. They say that they are supposed to be married to God and devote their life to God and his teachings. There is no reason why these men cannot have wives and families and still be faithful to God. I am sure that they now have other interests than God, such as a favorite sport or hobby. Is this taking away from their life with God? Not really. There is also no reason that women cannot be priest. In fact, there were even women priests and preachers in Jesus’ day. With all the rights that women have and all the equality that we have achieved should enable women to have the opportunity to be more than nuns. I think allowing priests to marry would have definitely helped to avoid most of the cases of pedophilia. Some men that are sick just go into the priesthood to hide their true identity and they are not even devoted to God. If they were allowed to have wives there wouldn’t be the problem of sexual tension that is arising today. Priests are humans too. I am not saying that sexual relations are necessary for life but I think having that significant other in your life is very important and not something that one should have to give up in order to be devoted to God and his teachings. I believe that God wants everyone to do the best that they can in all that they do and most importantly, to be happy. I think priests of today’s society would appreciate the fact that they have the option to have a family and not have to make that decision. I also believe that women priests would be a great asset to the Catholic Church, something new and refreshing. Some women may feel awkward repenting their sins to a man all the time. Maybe some would feel more comfortable talking to a woman. This might encourage more people to become active in the church and encourage women to further their faith. I know that I would feel much more comfortable talking to a woman about the things that I have done wrong. I feel like they are more nurturing and that they care more about how you feel than a man would. I feel like the men are just concerned about telling you what you have to do to make up for your sins. I don’t feel like they always just want to talk about things. I would also love to go to a mass that was done by a woman priest. That would be so new and so interesting. The catholic church has to find a happy medium where they can keep their tradition and also adapt to the constantly changing times. This will only help to better educate the people of today, by adapting to their way of life and relating to their day to day problems and concerns.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Unfortunately, gender discrimination is still a problem in our society today. Although it is much more subtle than it ever was it still does exist. I believe that gender discrimination is most prominent in the business world. Our society is trained to automatically think that the owner of a business or company is a man and all of his top managers and CEO’s are men as well. I think that we get this image from things such as television, movies, and sadly, real life. Most children grow up their fathers out working. It is rare that the father is the stay-at-home parent and the mother is out working. I also think that there is discrimination based on what want you choose to be your occupation. You rarely see a male preschool teacher, nurse, secretary, day care owner, or stay-at-home parent. I have personal experience concerning this issue. While my brother, my sister, and myself were growing up, my mom was always at school functions, always home to answer the phone, and always available to pick us up from school and friends houses. All of our friends’ mothers thought that was mom was a stay at home mom and so did their dads. So, when all of our families would all get together during the year, the fathers were automatically gravitate toward each other and talk business. Little did they know that my mother was the owner of the Universal Advertising Agency. She had began the business when we were all very young and she ran it from our house so that she could easily double as a stay-at-home parent! All of my friends fathers was amazed at how much she knew about the business world. Another example is my friends father. Most of my other friends’ mothers were lunch “ladies” at my old high school. Well, one father decided that he was going to become a lunch “man” because he worked nights and he had the whole day free. Although it was sort of weird at first, we ended up loving it because he would be the best cook there! He also gave out some free stuff here an there. What I am trying to say is that either sex has the potential to do anything they want whether that occupation is dominated by males or females. To help the problem of gender discrimination across our nation, I think that we just have to keep doing what we are doing already. We have to be open-minded, accepting, and not so ignorant to assume anything. I think we also have to expose the younger generations to different things. Learning tools such as flashcards with women nurses on one and a male doctor on the other does not help this cause. Young children are learning to decipher these two occupations by which sex dominates it. They are growing up thinking that females can’t be doctors and that men can’t be nurses. It is little things like this that is hindering our young generations.  \n\n\n\n\n",
        " People who say gender discrimination isn’t alive and well in our culture are dead wrong.  Have they never heard of the glass ceiling?  Sadly gender discrimination cuts both ways.  It’s aimed both at men and women in our day and age.  I think most people also aren’t sure what gender discrimination really is.  It can be something small, like a man assuming the only reason a woman is upset is PMS, or a woman making a statement making the excuse “its because he’s a man”.  Or it can be something much bigger like a difference in pay for two people doing the same job, with the only difference being their gender.  How does gender make you any different from others?  It shouldn’t even be a characteristic, which is counted.  As if gender is the only thing that could be wrong, or causing a problem.  Maybe the angry woman with “PMS” is just mean, and bitter and angry.  And maybe the man, who made the mistake, actually had a reason for it.  It even gets involved in careers.  There was a very prominent film a few years ago, “Meet the Parents”.  The father in this movie assumed that the main male character had become a nurse only because he couldn’t be a doctor.  The character had actually scored well above average on his entrance exams for medical school.  He made the decision to go into nursing, even though people always make the comment that it is a woman’s job.  Which brings up the point, why do we have these kinds of distinctions?  Is that not a form of gender discrimination in and of itself?  Anything one person can do, another can do, regardless of gender.  \nNow I’m not saying that restrictions should be lowered.  In some cases restrictions need to be strict.  Tests for firefighters should be the same for a woman as it is for a man.  This may mean there are fewer women in the field but the women who are there can actually do the job.  Restrictions and limits should be the same for women and man, sometimes restrictions are there for a reason.  \nAnother thing to talk about is the glass ceiling.  It seems in some gender dominated professions the opposite gender can only rise so high.  They then hit a barrier, which they cannot go through.  Others will be advanced ahead of them merely on the merit of gender.  Others will receive raises while their salary remains stagnant, again on the merit of gender.  It sounds suspiciously like racism.  How is it any different to discriminate by gender rather than race?  Simple answer: It isn’t.  It is the same as not allowing someone a seat on a bus due to their race, only this time it has been accepted for much longer.  Gender is not something which raises someone above another, men and women are different in many ways, but those ways complement each other, they should not battle against each other.  I’m not sure how the problem can be solved, but it certainly won’t happen immediately.  It will take some time.  \n",
        "\tLooking on someone’s privacy within a public school system should be something that is not looked negatively upon if students’ lives are at danger. The fact that school officials prevented a school shooting due to the discovery of a myspace bulletin fills me with happiness. I have talked with public school teachers about safety in the school system, and they said that parents drop students off at school with the idea that the building is a 100% safe place. Some people may believe that the school system’s looking on myspace was an invasion of privacy for the student who was caught. I believe that if the school system has a legitimate excuse for “spying” on a student, such as saving lives, nothing is the matter with what they did as long as they are protecting their students. \n\n\tIf a person accuses the school system of spying on the student who was caught, then they need to look deeper into the actions of the student. As stated before, the student posted his intentions on a myspace page about  the potential shooting. When looking at what the student did, most individuals do not realize that what he did was an outcry of what he wanted to do to the public. “Bulletin,” as stated on www.dictionary.com, is defined as, “a brief account or statement, as of news or events, issued for the information of the public.” The key words to focus on in this definition are “for the information of the public.” No one would ever post anything on a bulletin, with the intentions of the public not seeing the display. The fact that myspace is on the internet- an area filled with networks with the sole purpose of communication- also shows how obvious the student’s outcry was. Since the purpose of an internet bulletin is for the public to view, I believe that the school system did not invade the student’s privacy. It is obvious that if someone posts something for everyone to see, even people who a person may not like may be able to see that post. The fact that the school system caught this message was nowhere near an invasion of privacy for the student. It was just as easy for the school officials to see the bulletin as a regular person could in their home. The Public School System educates the public and looks after their children during certain hours of the day. The School System did not invade the student’s privacy because, as indicated in the “public” portion of the name, the school has just as much of a right to view myspace profiles as anyone else in the community.\n\n\tThe line to draw for the Public School System in regards to privacy for its students should be clearly noted as a point where one student may endanger his/herself, other students, or the school at all. If a threat is not posed, then schools should not go online to look for things to accuse students of. If, however, a threat is posed, then the school needs to do its job by any means necessary to keep its students safe. If something is so obviously displayed to the point where School Officials can go on to the most popular website online and look it up, if the message is too private then the material should never have been entered to the website in the first place. Since the school in this prevention of the shooting helped save lives, then that’s all that should be talked about. Saving lives and safety in general has and will always be a bigger concern than an invasion of privacy within schools and around the country.\n\n29\n\n",
        "\tI think that gender discrimination is an ongoing issue in the United States.  While it’s being shown that we are slowly improving this, there is still much room in which we can eliminate discrimination.  Statistics even today show that women make lower wages than men do in many companies.  Some places this difference is really subtle, but in others the gaps are much more apparent.  Just the fact that employers must show their employees videos about sexual harassment and gender discrimination proves the existence of many places in which this discrimination is still existing today.\n\tI feel that this is a continuing idea of an outdated mindset that women are inferior to men and their place is in the home rather than in the business.  This mindset not only restricts the rights of other human beings, but also slows down progress that could be made by having women do the same jobs as men.  The job market is not even the biggest source of discrimination of women.  A lot of this discrimination comes from in the home or even just at social gatherings.  Many families assign roles based on gender.  The man will mow the lawn, fix broken appliances, etc while the woman does the grocery shopping, cleans, and does the cooking.  While this is not true in all families, it is in many.  A child growing up in one of these families will assume that this is the way it is supposed to be and in turn become discriminatory, even if not intentional.\n\tThe best way to work on getting rid of discrimination in the workplace and at home is for women to show that they can do all of the same things as men, and for men to learn to accept change.  This should not be a forceful thing, but more of a mutual issue that should be solved.  The use of force may solve the problems revolving around earnings and jobs held in the house, but will only increase tensions.  This in the long run will only lead to make the situation worse and in reality, nothing will be solved.  However, if both sides can stoop down to the same level, neither will be able to overpower the other and eventually change will make way.\n\tWhile gender related jokes can get you a good chuckle sometimes, it is best to try to get rid of these.  Though the message is supposed to be “out of the loop” and only meant to be funny, it also plants stereotypes in your mind.  So all in all, the best ways to get rid of gender discrimination would be for men and women alike to begin ignoring these jokes and stereotypes.  After the stereotypes have been eliminated from both men and women, both sides can begin to progress to a more efficient non-discriminatory society.  Women will get more jobs and men will learn not to question this, wages will level out for both genders and soon enough these will even apply to the household.\n",
        "\tI think that both sides are wrong when approaching the issue of gay marriage.  I feel that it is not up to the state or federal government to make a decision on this issue.  While some will argue that they are just trying to get a deduction on their taxes, they do not provide any legitimate reasons as to why they shouldn’t be able to just because they are married to someone of the same sex.  Allowing homosexuals to marry wouldn’t have any negative impact on the economy since taxes remain gender unspecific.  However, it would also be wrong to force all churches to allow gay marriage.  Some branches of a certain faith would be forced to go against their own beliefs for the appeasement of others.  These churches should be allowed to practice what they believe without the interference of the government just as much as those who wish to legalize gay marriage.\n\tSome may bring up the moral issues with homosexual marriage.  The idea of homosexual marriage may be against their beliefs, but just because that is so, doesn’t mean that everyone is against it.  Trying to enforce this idea onto others would just be like using coercive methods to get everybody to believe in God.  I consider myself agnostic and find no fault in allowing homosexuals to marry.  However, it is not up to the government to decide whether homosexuals be allowed to marry or not allowed.\n\tThis decision is solely up to the church in which the couple is being married.  The idea of “separation of church and state” has been well known and instituted throughout generations, and it is not the time to start crossing the lines.  If it were up to me I would not allow any kind of marriage to be able to satisfy some kind of tax deduction.  This could be done through other sort of methods (such as the idea of Civil-Unions).\n\tPresident Bush has no right (according to the already existing U.S. constitution) to impose this new amendment.  The governments powers do not extend this far and they shouldn’t try to do so.  I feel that this is an act of tyranny, an attack on the restrictions given to the federal government when this document was written.  There is no way to say that this is a fair idea for an amendment without backing it with your personal religious opinions or sexual biases.   There is no clear evidence that this would have a negative impact on anything other than those who oppose it.  What gets done in the government should be what is in the interest of its citizen’s rights and its own limitations, not in the public interest.  The movement to make this an amendment is a fine example of our government moving towards a neo-conservative administration.\n\tIt is not up for the government to decide upon this issue, it is only up to the church.  Through separation of church and state, President Bush’s proposal for a new amendment is illegal.  I can’t forget to mention that if passed, this would be the first amendment that restricted the people rather than the government.\n",
        "      Some states have legalized gay marriage, but other states have not.  This issue is a big one in the United States.  I do not real feel that either side is right or wrong.  This issue is one which is so personal, that I can not really determine how I feel about it.  At the risk of sounding self-centered, I will say this anyway:  since I am not homosexual, this issue has not really been one that is in the forefront of my mind.  I am not going to be directly affected by laws which legalize or ban gay marriage.  To me, it doesn’t really make much of a difference whether or not gay marriage is legalized.  If homosexual couples want to enter into a legal bound relationship such as marriage, just as heterosexual couples do, then I can’t really see that it is right to prevent this from happening.  Who are we to tell two people who are in love and want to spend the rest of their lives together that they are not allowed to get married?   On the other hand, marriage is traditionally thought of as a sacred bond between a man and a woman.  \n      To help decipher how I feel about gay marriage, I will first go to the root – the idea of marriage itself.  In this day and age, when it is becoming more common for couples to live together and to raise families without ever getting married, we must ask why people get married.  If you can live together and have a family without being married, then why do it?  My answer is that when you marry someone, regardless of all of the legal aspects of marriage, you are saying that you love that person so much that you want to spend the rest of your life with them.  You make a vow that through good and bad, you will stay together “until death do us part.”  These are pretty powerful ideas.  So if two people really are this much in love and really to want to commit themselves to this sort of a bond, then they should be permitted to, whether or not they are heterosexual or homosexual.  \n      Now, all of that said, I still can’t quite shake my old-fashioned ideas about marriage being an act meant for a man and a woman.  Also, although I stated earlier that it is possible to live together and to have children without being married, I feel that if you love someone enough to start a family with them, then for the sake of the children, you should get married.  If you are not planning on staying in a committed relationship with your partner, then you should probably not have children.  \n      As far as whether or not the federal government should be involved in this issue, I feel that we, as a country, should at least be united on the question of the legalization of or banning of gay marriage.  While I do not really feel very strongly one way or another (I am not necessarily a supporter of gay marriage, but I can’t say that I am “offended” by it, or really strongly oppose it either), I do believe that whatever decision is made, should be true throughout the whole country.\n\n",
        "      For the first time in the 230 year history of the United States of America, a woman is Speaker of the House (though the both the House and Senate are still mostly made up of men).  Condaleezza Rice is only the second female secretary of state in that same amount of time.  And of course a woman has never been President or Vice President.  If our government, the most powerful institution in the country, is still dominated by men, how can any U.S. citizen deny that gender discrimination is still a very real problem in American society?\n\tThe political arena is not the only career that lacks female representation.  When I was younger, and often thinking about becoming an astronaut or a Broadway star, my dad used to tell me, “just don’t think about becoming an engineer.”  Though said in jest, his comment was actually quite critical of his field for the way it treats women.  He made the observation of how difficult it was for women to acquire positions of power and responsibility.  In general, men still on average make more money per hour than women who do the same job.  A drastic example of this wage disparity is found in professional tennis, where the amount of prize money for men is much greater than the amount of prize money for women\n\tThe continued presence of gender discrimination against women in the workplace is a very real problem that still needs to be dealt with.  However, there other areas of life, it seems like gender discrimination has developed in the opposite direction.  I read an article in Time magazine last year about the disadvantages faced by boys in the American educational system.  If I read an article about gender discrimination fifteen, maybe even ten years ago, it would surely be about the disadvantages faced by young girls.  But it seems that in an attempt to correct the neglect directed towards these girls, school systems and individual teachers have overcompensated, becoming so focused on the girls that they no longer pay attention to the boys and their particular educational needs.  More boys, who often seek attention, become the class clowns.  The girls always performed much better academically in my elementary school.  If nothing else, the gender statistics on college attendance should be a great indication of some kind of gender discrimination.  Here at Loyola College, the population is at least 60% female.  \n\tIt is impossible to completely eradicate any kind of discrimination from American society, because there will always be at least one individual who makes judgments based on a person’s gender or their race.  But it is very possible to improve the situation further in the U.S., and the only way to do this is to first acknowledge that a problem still exists.  Then the government must work harder to enforce laws against discrimination and make harsher the punishments for breaking those laws.  When dealing with the educational system, the administration needs to more closely monitor the classroom methods of its teachers.\n",
        "      As a member of the Catholic Church, I do not feel that the church needs to change its ways to adapt to life in the 21st century. I disagree with the cases of pedophilia and agree that they do need to be addressed and dealt with. I do not think that these cases could have been prevented if the church changed or adapted its ways to the 21s century.  \n \tTo begin, I have been a member of my church since I was born. I went to a private grammar and private high school, both with churches on the property. There would be days that we would dress in our church attire and miss class to attend mass. From the 4th grade to the 12th grade (up until I came to Loyola) I was a member of my parish’s chorus. I was also a lector at the teenage mass on Sundays. Holidays were always a big deal in my family; our holiday dinners and gatherings would be planned around what mass we were going to. I would buy a new outfit to wear for Christmas and Easter, just so I look nice at mass. This is the church I know, I do not need it to change; I like it the way it is. I do not think the church should change because it was created this way and should stay the way it was created to be. I think that the 21st century has destroyed the image of the church and the mass. For my parish in particular, people no longer get “dressed up”, but sometimes come in their “beach” attire after a morning under the sun. People even walk into mass 20 minutes late-I just don’t see the point. People seem to have lost their respect for the sanctity of the church. \nI do not think that the cases of pedophilia could have been prevented. The church could not have known that these people would turn out to do such horrible things. If they did, then they were very wrong in trying to hide this information. I have no sympathy for any of these men that took advantage of boys using their power and situation. \n      I do not believe that priests should be allowed to marry nor should women be able to become priests. These ideas were not involved in the early days of the church-it would just be weird if it were to change. Like the example I gave in the emails with the show “7th Heaven”, seeing Lucy as a reverend seems strange to me. I am accustomed to seeing males as the priest or reverend figure. This may sound old fashion, I am 18 and not old fashion, but concerning the church, I like the things they way they are. \n      If I were immediately affected by the scandals in the church I do not think that my opinion would be any different. I do not think allowing women to become priests would have made a difference; women are just as capable as committing these acts, as are men. And the question for whether a priest should be allowed to get married, well married men have committed acts of pedophilia also. \n      The church has changed its ways, it has become more lenient, it has adapted. \n",
        "\tThe War in Iraq is a really tough subject to come to a conclusion on.  I do believe that this is an unjust and unnecessary war, but sadly the decision was made to deploy troops and now we are stuck there until the job is complete.  We have torn apart their government (hopefully for the better) but in the whole run, we have also torn apart their society.  Civil war has only begun in Iraq and we will probably see it continue and possibly overthrow any type of order that we may put in place there.\n\tWith this said, I guess it can be determined that I feel that the war has gone on long enough, and I would love to have all of the troops pulled out safely.  However, if this were done we’d be creating more problems than we’ve solved (if that hasn’t been done already).  Any type of government currently in place would easily be torn down at a much higher pace than it was created.  For this reason we must keep our troops in there to maintain stability.  If we were to withdraw at this point in time there would also be many more civilian casualties due to national feuds that exist in Iraq.\n\tOne thing that I highly do not agree with is the United States government sending more and more troops overseas to help fight.  There have been relatively few casualties on our own side, deploying more troops just seems like an attempt to “show our power.”  However, all that it is doing is putting more lives in danger than are needed.  This operation can be accomplished, or come closer to being accomplished with the current amount of troops that we have deployed.  Setting up a government should not be force based (the approach that George W. Bush has gone at it), but more of a deliberated issue so that both sides can remain somewhat satisfied in the end.\n\tI guess with all of this said, if I had to choose one way or the other, I would choose for the war to end and deliberation to begin.  This way we could work with the Iraqi citizens to form a government that would not show support or opposition to one side or the other (Shiite or Sunni).  This government would need to be a neutral central power that could resolve the issues between both sides through words rather than violence.  The United States government is looking at this through the wrong eyes.  They are assuming that unless we use guns and bombs, nothing will ever be solved.  They are seeing the citizens of Iraq as dogs that need to be tamed rather than people who have free thinking minds that can help decide on issues themselves.  I’m sure that if given a choice, over 90 percent of the citizens there would choose peaceful deliberation over violence.  However, because our government does not see it that way, the war continues and more troops are continuously deployed.\n",
        "      Let me begin by saying that I believe war is a horrible thing, but it is sometimes unavoidable.  To say that we can live in a world without war is naïve.  There will always be those who are willing to use war to further their objectives, or to prevent something bigger down the road.  In the case of the United States and Iraq, we went to war because we had intelligence that strongly suggested that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction or the capacity to make them.  George Bush, and others, made the decision to remove this threat.  I believe it was the right decision.\n      It really is not our place to make an opinion on the political decisions of our leaders for the simple fact that we do not possess the entire picture like they do.  They are the ones who make educated decisions, not us.  I think we have to put our trust in our leaders.  George Bush is not out to take over the world – he just wants to be good at his job.\n      People will criticize Bush for the Iraq war, saying that it has gone on for too long, and that too many American lives were lost.  What if the United States had not gone to war, and Saddam decided to wipe Israel off the map with nuclear tipped missiles?  Or, a more likely scenario would be that Saddam would sell weapons of mass destruction to terrorists who would eventually use them in the United States.  Tens of thousands of lives would have been lost.  Then people would criticize Bush for not taking action.  You see, hindsight always has you coming out smelling like roses.\n      It is not our job to determine what the United States should do in the world arena.  We should leave it up to the CIA, NSA, and all the other agencies whose job it is to protect us.  They collect and analyze an enormous amount of intelligence and provide suggestions based on that intelligence.  We should let the experts do their jobs.\n      Since we have already begun the war, we cannot just pick up and leave now that it has gotten unpopular.  We have to train the Iraqi military and police force, and make sure they have the capacity to defend their nation.  Once the job is done, then we can leave.  \n      I know that a substantial amount of American soldiers have died as a result of the Iraq war.  Compared to other wars, however, the number of lives lost in the Iraq war is miniscule.  There have been losses in the thousands in the Iraq war.  In WWII, hundreds of thousands of American soldiers were killed.  I think it feels like its worse than it actually is because of the media and the way it likes to chronicle every life lost.\n      It’s not a matter of whether the war has “gone on long enough.”  Some wars just last longer than others.  The key is that the objectives must be completed, and as of yet, they have not.\n",
        "\tI think that the Catholic Church is definitely stuck in the past and that it needs to adapt to the twenty first century. Judging by all the pedophilia incidents with the priests, I think that the church would be wise to adapt. We were born to be sexual creatures, and living a live of celibacy is very difficult. Also, for the sake of the reputation of the Catholic Church, it would probably be more beneficial. I find that people are beginning to associate Catholic priests with pedophilia and it is giving the church a bad name. The Catholic Church has always been known for being upstanding and righteous, and these acts definitely do not reflect that. I know that by changing this rules, the Catholic Church would be ending centuries of tradition, but considering how much the world has changed since the Catholic Church was instated, it would be a beneficial change. The Catholic Church has essentially stayed the same all of these years, and it seems that if they had been more willing to adapt and change with the times, it would have avoided many past problems and the current ones they are dealing with now. The Church also would have avoided a lot of controversy. I definitely agree that the Catholic Church’s unwillingness to change is the main reason why they are dealing with all of these problems and having these cases of pedophilia among the priests and boys in the church. By changing, it is likely that all of this would have been prevented. You do not really see any of these things occurring in churches that allow their pastors, priests or whatever to marry. \n\tAlthough making changes to the traditions of the Catholic Church is the most logical and practical thing to do, it is probably an impossible task, at least in this day and age. The fact that the Catholic Church is built on centuries of tradition makes change seem pretty far-fetched. Also, since it was started in Europe, the change would have to begin there with the Pope. Also, making changes would probably spark a lot of turmoil and disagreement because everyone is so used to the way things are. Making changes like these would completely revolutionize the Catholic religion and by be open to wanting to change; it would open the door for more things like having women priests. I don’t thing having whether or not the church has women priests is as much of an issues as allowing priests to marry. Not having women as priests has not really been the root of any problems in the Church, at least to my knowledge. Obviously having equality is important, and I not allowing women to be priests is unfair, but I personally am not really offended by it, I’m not really sure why. I think because of how strict and narrow the traditions of the Catholic are, and female priest would not be well received, at least not in the beginning. I think it would be more difficult for her to have a strong church and large congregation because I think she would be less respected because she is a woman. \n      All in all, I think that the Catholic Church has a lot of loose ends they need to tie up and problems they need to figure out how to solve so that they can avoid all the controversy and bad publicity they’ve been getting. \n",
        "      The history of the Catholic Church is a history of criticism and scandal.  For many years, Catholic officials used their power to stifle the creativity and scientific research of the time.  Today the Church is no longer an enemy of learning, but a critical observer of the ways in which we use new knowledge.  As science and technology advance at an astronomic pace, is it not the role of religious institutions to remain steadfast to faith, to remain a stable presence in the otherwise fickle lives of its believers?  \n      The Catholic Church takes many positions on current issues that many people oppose.  For example, it is against abortion and the death penalty, a position that I completely agree.  The Catholic Church advocates the rights of human beings, most importantly their right to live, at every stage of that life.  The Church often goes beyond a defense based on Christian beliefs, and explains its position in terms of the contemporary, material world that we live in.  For example, the Church informs people of the fact that it costs more to execute a criminal than to imprison him for life.  It also tries to educate people about the gross injustice that plagues the criminal justice system.  Statistics show that a majority of the criminals put to death are poor and members of a minority.  These are the people that don’t have the big bucks to pay big-shot attorneys and afford appeal after appeal after appeal.\n      A substantial amount of members of the Catholic Church desire changes in the hierarchal power structure that governs the Church as an institution.  Like most other institutions before the feminist movement, the Catholic Church is ruled by men.  Only men are allowed to become priests, bishops, cardinals, and of course, pope.  Men who belong to these vocations are not allowed to marry (although, there are very rare cases in which a married Protestant minister desires to convert to Catholicism and becomes a priest, and he is allowed to do so as a married man).  However, in terms of everyday life and function of the Church, it can be argued that women play an equal if not greater role than men.  Because there is such a lack of men entering the priesthood, the responsibility of the lay people in each parish has greatly increased.  Here women can exercise a certain amount of authority.  Yet, I can’t help but wonder if the priesthood would be so lacking if it were opened up to women.  And the child molestation scandal would certainly have been discovered and dealt with much sooner.  Because the problem was not only the pedophiles, but the priests who kept their secrets.  I find it very hard to believe that any women would stay silent amidst such behavior.\n\tReligious doctrines and tenets of one’s faith are elements of one’s life that are supposed to remain as a constant.  They are supposed to be integral part of their believers, and serve to guide them in their observations of the world and their experiences in it.  However, the Church as an institution, a creation of society, should be open to change as the society in which it operates grows and develops.  We have become a society which more and more recognizes the equal rights of women and values their talents and capabilities.  Maybe it’s time the Catholic Church did the same. \n",
        "\tI honestly don’t know that much about the Iraq War.  I’m not aware of many of the reasons people give in support or against it, so all I can say is what I think without having many of the facts.\n\tI feel that war was basically a bad idea to begin with.  Diplomacy would have been a much less damaging way to go, and would have led to greater results in the long run.  We went in with barely any support and basically politically bullied other countries into giving up their own resources for our use in a war we started all on our own.  It should have been an issue contained within the United Nations from the beginning.  Granted, the UN should have more power in deciding conflicts and authority over member countries.  Perhaps its relative ineffectiveness is part of the reason today we are still involved in a conflict that could have been avoided years ago.\n\tI honestly think the war in Iraq has done nothing  but make things worse.  The argument has been made that Saddam Hussein’s regime was an evil that America was right to rid the world of, and his image has been likened to that of Hitler.  But in the case of World War II, cries went out from the persecuted groups in Germany that were heard around the world.  The people wanted to be helped, and realized that nothing would ever change without major outside intervention.  Plus, Hitler posed an immediate threat to America because Germany and other members of the Axis were poised to take over the world if ever the Allied forces let down their defenses for a minute.  Saddam Hussein was in no way trying to take over America, or even European countries.  All of the “weapons of mass destruction” which posed such an immediate threat to us in 2001 have yet to be discovered, while if they had ever occurred in such quantities as they were thought to you’d think we would at least find a clue as to what happened to them.\n\tEven President Bush has changed his opinion, or at least his administration has.  “Stay the course”, encouraging citizens to keep supporting the war and discouraging a reevaluation of its execution and purpose, has changed to endorsement of a change in methods as Bush’s approval ratings magically drop.  I think a drastic change needs to made in America’s action in this war, or we are going to be in it for just as long as Vietnam if not longer, with even less results.  It’s not even clear what we’re trying to accomplish anymore.  Are we trying to rebuild Iraq, or just instill democracy, or still rid it of insurgent factions, or keep it under military control so it’s no longer a threat.  There are many mixed messages running through that war, and I’m not sure how Bush is even justifying keeping troops there so long after the war has officially been declared over.  The war in Iraq is still as much a war as the war in Korea was, although its motives are much less clear.\n\tAlthough since we went in to begin with, we have changed so much and had such an effect on the lives of Iraqi citizens that we have a responsibility not to just pull out and go back to America, and pretend like we were never there.  What we should be doing is not trying to patch up the situation by ourselves however, but admitting humility and asking for help.  Instead of donating money, time and supplies to giving Iraq new buildings and a new government, we should open up a little bit diplomatically to see what the Iraqi citizens actually expect and want from us, and what the UN thinks we should do.  The WAR, at any rate, has to end before any real improvement can begin.  If we can’t reach a compromise with Iraq that allows us to help them without them attacking us, then a neutral party needs to step in and take over relations because the way we’re going is leading us nowhere.\n",
        "I believe that gender discrimination still exists towards men in that they are still looked down upon when they consider low key roles like being a stay at home dad or a nurse. For example in the movie Meet the Parents on the character’s Gaylord Fauker was constantly made fun of by her fiancée’s father because he was a nurse. I believe that men will never get out of the role of being the one that in authority, take a look at our world today there are constant examples of males in power: the Pope, and even the president up until next year’s candidate. \nGender discrimination is a mindset, and the world even today is still stuck in the mentality that woman aren’t supposed to be leaders and men are. It’s a mindset that subordinates women just because we are more sensitive about others. Society sets us as being missionaries, housewives, nurses, models, and even porn stars; these are traditional female roles, and although some men choose to occupy them they are deemed the ones who aren’t “man enough” to occupy leadership roles. \nGender discrimination still takes place in the workplace and in our society as a whole. If you look in magazines or in advertisements, women are always held by men or the men are always protecting the women. If a woman is holding a man or caressing a man it is seen as dominating and the man as being a punk. \nThe I Love New York 2 series is breaking this standard. No longer is a woman looking for a man who is going to stand up to his wife and be the head of the household. New York is looking for “her wife” someone to have dinner on the table for her when she comes home. When I heard her say this I was stunned because honestly I was like “what self-respecting man want to be called his wife’s wife”? Why does our society think this? Why was this my initial reaction instead nothing like it would have been had I heard a man say this? Once again I believe it was because of our society, our society engrains in us than the man should be the protector even if he is in subordinate position like a housedad or a secretary. \nFrom previous discussions with my friends who are adamant about our gender discriminations problems in our world today, I remembered them saying that women make less than men in corporate industries. I was at first totally oblivious to this notion but apparently it is still something that goes on to this day. I often think about situations like this in our world were we recognize something bad going on, now the next step is what do we to prevent it. The U.S. tries to make laws about it but there are always ways around laws. And if the woman speaks up she may be harassed at work. So if we recognize all these problems with the workplace how do we fix it so that the workplace can be a fair and just place where everyone can receive equal opportunities. \n\n",
        "Of course the war in Iraq has caused controversy.  All war causes controversy.  Most people have been connecting 9/11 to the Iraq war, and that’s just plain not true.  The government itself has even said there is no connection to 9/11.  Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction.  There were no mobile labs.  There was no anthrax.  That being said, I disagree with the reasons we supposedly went into Iraq.  Perhaps it was for oil, perhaps it was depose a dictator, but frankly, America is not the protector of the world.  It is not our job to take care of everyone.  Saddam Hussein may have been a horrible tyrant, but it is not our job to change that.  The big question is, what do we do now?  We have gone in, whether the reasons are valid or not, we are there.  So, what next?  We can’t just leave; we’ve left them with no recognizable system of government.  We took theirs away and have left it in shambles.  The “government” that’s in place is a puppet it’s not real.  How can we leave them now?  If we pull all of the troops out of Iraq in one fell swoop the society would collapse.  The bigger question is whether they even want a democratic government.  Perhaps, a democracy like we have here in the United States would not work in Iraq.  The society has been around much longer and is much more set in its traditions.  Who are we to decide that they should be democratic?  We can’t choose what’s right for their country any more than we can force the rest of the world to give up their prejudices.  I think the war itself has gone on far enough.  Why is the US building permanent military bases in Iraq?  It quite seems as though we are there to stay, which is not why we went in there in the first place.  \nBesides which, we keep sending more and more troops in, but not many are coming home.  We do not need so many troops there.  Unless we are trying to create the American colony of Iraq, bring some of them home! \nAlso, no one thinks about the fact that maybe, just maybe some of them just plain are not happy that we stuck our noses into their countries business.  Who gave us that right?  We are not the big brothers for the world.  It cannot be our job to be the police force and the protector for the planet.  We do not have the right to take over, and force our views on others.  Not everyone in the world should necessarily be a democrat.  It will not work in some cultures, they are just too different.   I think this war was started on false pretenses and needs to end.  However I do not know how that can be done, I am not a government strategist, we need to rely on them to pull us out gradually without allowing the government in Iraq to collapse.  \n",
        "\tWhen the war in Iraq first began, I fully supported President Bush’s decision to send troops into the country.  With aspirations of toppling an evil dictator and recovering weapons of mass destruction, it seemed that Bush had concrete, noble objectives that were within our reach to achieve.  Both of these objectives came to a climax.  Saddam Hussein was apprehended and put to trial.  However, no weapons of mass destruction were found. Ever since then, the media has mocked Bush each and every day for sending our troops into Iraq.\n\tAt this time, it would be in our country’s best interests to pull out of Iraq.  We have been over there for several years, and even though we have made some progress towards bringing democracy to the people of Iraq, the development is coming to a screeching halt.  My brother joined the Marine Corps after the war started, and he has already returned from his second tour of duty there.  However, many of our soldiers are not as fortunate as my brother.  Every day we hear of more and more casualties.  This continuous, fruitless war, with fighting that leads to more deaths and less progress, is drastically hurting the morale of our nation at a time when we need it most.  We need to accept the fact that even though we have captured Saddam Hussein, the people of Iraq are not going to change.\n",
        "There are a lot of things one can say about the Catholic Church in this day and age.  The Catholic Church has been around in various incarnations for centuries.  It has changed and evolved since it began, but the big question is has it changed enough?  There are numerous arguments against the Church changing, one of these is that the church cannot be wrong because it follows the teachings of the Bible.  A glaring problem with this is that the Bible did not arrive by fax from heaven.  It was written by man.  Not only was it written by man, there are many books that did not make it into the bible, which were written.  These books may have even lent more to our understanding of Christianity as a whole.  The point is that the Catholic Church must move with the times.  As humans change, so must the systems that serve as their support systems.  Catholicism is working under the same rules it has worked under for centuries.  Many of the rules and expectations from the church are antiquated and obsolete.  Others were rules which were made for political and financial reasons and are now seen as religious obligations.  The reason priests are not allowed to marry in the Catholic Church is a rule which was originally made to make the Church money.  The land owned by the priests (on which the church stood) would, if the priest had a family, go to his son, rather than the church.  This would cause the church to lose both the land and the church that stood on the land.  Why shouldn’t a priest be allowed to have a family? In almost every other Christian sect a pastor is married or is allowed to, it gives them a chance at a full life.   Priests are human, just like anyone else.  They deserve the right to live as all humans live, with love, both emotional and physical.  However, this is not the only way in which the church is stuck in the middle ages.  Many other rules are outdated as well.  Women are no different from men, so why should they not be allowed to be priests?  Women have the same ability to be spiritual leaders.  It is understandable that in older time periods women were seen as inferior to men, and it is even understandable that the church viewed women this way.  The symbolism in the Old Testament makes it clear that women are more susceptible to “sin” in the eyes of the church.  In modern times however, we know that women and men are no different from each other, and can do the same things.  We have women in places of power in every other aspect of life, there is no reason for women to be kept down in the church. So many things about the Church are good, but so many others are the exact opposite.  The Church needs to move into the twenty-first century.  So many people trust in the Church as their guiding force, and so it must move with the times and keep ahead of the darkness that people face.  \n",
        "\tGender discrimination is not a huge issue in today’s society, but it still lingers.  I feel like it is on par with racism.  Collectively, it is much less of a problem than it once was, but there are still instances in which it flares up.  No one speaks about it, either.\n\tFor the most part, employers want to maximize profits and minimize losses.  People don’t understand that it is costly to discriminate when it comes to hiring workers.  Women who have the same set of skills, or better skills, as other men who are not hired may be hired by some other employer.  Just look at the cosmetics industry.  Fifteen years ago, the higher ranks of the cosmetics industry were dominated by men, which seems counterintuitive.  It turns out that it was counterintuitive.  Mary Kay is an entrepreneur who was never promoted into the high ranks, so she started her own business.  With her superior set of skills, she constructed the Mary Kay cosmetics giant.  \n\tThe Mary Kay example should show employers that women are indeed capable of having brilliant ideas.  They are not going to turn them away anymore just because they are women.\n\tAt this point, there really isn’t anything that can be done to reduce the remaining gender discrimination in the United States.  There are some employers who are so set on discriminating that they will never change.  That is simply a fact of life.  They can choose to hire whomever they wish, at their own loss.  There is no way to force these bigots into hiring women.\n\tOn the whole, however, I think women have the same opportunities to succeed as men.  It is up to them to succeed in life.  I also think some women use gender discrimination as an excuse for their lack of success.  Because of this, it is difficult to gauge the severity of the problem.\n\tGender discrimination is not limited to women.  I think gay men are discriminated against in the workplace, especially if they have a particularly “manly” job like a police officer or firefighter.  They are subject to ridicule and lack of promotion to a much greater extent than women.  In fact, women in these positions may receive preferential treatment just so the organization looks as if it does not gender discriminate.\n\tSometimes, the nature of the job necessitates having a man over a woman.  Roofing, construction, and other physically demanding jobs are better suited to men.  It’s a fact of life that men are generally stronger than women, so when a job requires a great deal of strength, why would the employer hire a woman over a man?  In this case, it is not an example of gender discrimination.  Although there will be some women out there who will try to claim that they are being discriminated against.  Employers and women need to work together to make gender discrimination disappear completely.  There is nothing more that the government can do.  It is up to individuals to make this problem history.\n",
        "There is no such thing as an unlawful invasion of privacy becuase Americans are nowhere guaranteed the right to privacy.  If the American government suspects potential harm, it has the power to invade the privacy of American citizens in the interest of doing what is best for the nation and the American people as a whole.  National security can only be acheived through invading privacy because subversive acts are naturally kept private.  No one would advertise their involvement in a harmful or malicious act, because of the consequences that could result. In order to uncover these acts before they happen, therefore, it is necessary to invade privacy and investigate suspicious activity.  If the government has reason to believe that someone is hiding something which could be dangerous to the US or to other people, the government has a duty to protect its citizens by investigating the hidden activity.  Of course, no government is justified in invading privacy without cause, but wherever suspicious activity is present or believed to exist, it is absolutely acceptable for the government to intervene, invading privacy if necessary to uphold safety and security. In the case of preventing a school shooting through an invasion of privacy, lives were saved and the invasion of privacy was completely justified because its aim was to maintain American security.\n",
        "I think we should never have gotten involeved in the War in Iraq in the first place, but now that we are we have certain responsibilities to take care of before we leave.  It was not exactly a good decision to get involved in a full scale war without support of any other countries or the UN.  If that many other governments are rleuctant to get involved, what made us think our reasons were overpowering?  Well the threat of weapons of mass destruction for one.  Weapons of mass destruction which mysteriously no longer exist.  Oil was another, and I don't see a way that we can deny that.  Our government made rash decisions in the defense of the US economy, not US society and safety.  We took it on ourselves to invade another country and mold it to our specifications, instead of going through diplomatic channels to work out a solution.  Our problem was not only rashness, but impatience.  True Iraq was ingoring UN orders in the time shortly before the war, but I feel it could have all been worked out with a much better, safer solution.  Third party intervention was a must between the US and Iraq at that time, and there just wasn't a strong enough force holding us back.  All of these factors, as well as anti-Iraqi sentiment generated by the government, contributed to us getting into a royal mess rivaling Vietnam.  But now that we're there, we have to think critically to find the best way out.\n\nThe problem with people who advocate an end to the war and withdrawl of all troops from Iraq immediately is that we are so intricately entangled in the whole ordeal that it is much more complicated than staying or going.  I feel the war has gone on long enough indeed.  Saying it's over doesn't make it so.  The war will never be over until we slowly remove troops over time and start rebuilding by a different process - through diplomatic channels.  We can do more good for Iraq from far away than we can by staying smack in the middle.  Sometimes you can't see the forest through the trees - we are losing perspective and the big picture the longer we stay in Iraq.  What we need is to remover ourselves from the situation slowly and look at it objectively.  We need to remove the USA from the equation entirely - right now we are looking at Iraq in terms of life here, and trying to fix it so that it fits our image of what life should be like.  Instead, we need to look at life in Iraq now in terms of the way it has been previously.  It has changed indeed over the past few years but it will never be what we want it to, for the simple fact that Iraq is NOT the US and never will be.\n\nI feel sad when I think about the war because I think it is a prime example of how emotion gets in the way of rationality.  Because everyone was so riled up and angry after 9-11, Bush was able to raise enough support for a war against Iraq.  This move had probably been considered by politicians for years, but the time was finally right.  We now not only had economic issues at stake in Iraq, but also humanitarian ones with Saddam Hussein's abuses and security ones with the weapons of mass destruction.  As a country, we made bad decisions during that time.  Now we need to do what is necessary to change our image in the eyes of the world, and to prove that we can be rational and mature.  We need to be responsible, to admit that this has gone too far, and to ask for intervention on the part of the UN to mediate relations between us and Iraq because the direct route isn't working, and hasn't worked for a long time.  When something isn't getting you the results expected, \"change is the future\", don't just \"stay the course\".\n\n",
        "I think both sides are wrong.  While legalizing it is what I WOULD support, I also am very supportive of separation of church and state.  The government should have no say in a matter like this.  Though being married does create paperwork for things such as taxes, just because the partner is someone of the same sex does not mean that this will become a problem.  I think that it is up to the church to decide matters like this, that way people will always have an option if they want it and always be able to avoid it if they don't.  I am wholely against President Bush's THOUGHT about implementing an amendment of the sort.  Amendment's are supposed to tell us what the government can and cannot do, not tell us what WE can and cannot do.  That's for state law.  In all honesty I feel that President Bush has absolutely no clue about how the government is supposed to work and likes to cross lines that have been in place for scores and centuries.\n",
        "I think that the issue of gay marriage should be one of state governments and not national government.

Although I'm not a complete supporter of homosexuality, I do have a lot of gay friends and I feel as though I would want them to be happy and able to have the same opportunities as heterosexual couples.

        "To whom it may concern-\n\nI believe that the war in Iraq was, and is a good idea. It is true that there has been a LOT of money spent over there, but everyone should look out for one another as human beings. I think that a lot of people do not support the war just because they don't like George W. Bush. I support his efforts in the Mid-East mainly because he is the leader of the greatest nation on Earth. If I start a project, I don't get up and leave half way through. A lot of Americans think that this is what Bush should do with the war. I like the fact that he is sticking to what he wants to do. What people need to realize is that he knows things that we are never allowed to set eyes on. We don't know what the \"real story\" is behind the curtain so to speak. I'm sure that if we knew everything that all the other world leaders have done throughout the world, we would be supporting Bush all the way.\n\nA true leader knows when to stick with his/her ways, even if his people don't like what he/she is doing. Yes, I feel bad for all of the soldiers over there, but I also support them being there. They all knew what they were signing up for when they enlisted, so they should not be complaining (as harsh as that sounds). The civilians who are complaining about the war make it seem as though we (the United States) don't even support our troops as they say that the war is pointless. This really makes me mad, because it's people like that who are disrespecting our armed forces and all of their good deeds. If this was right after September 11th, EVERYONE would be \"gung ho\" about the Iraq war, but since everyone's blood is not flowing as much anymore, their dedication has dropped. I think that true Americans should support their armed forces and leader even through rough times. If the country is in a rough patch because of a mistake, we still need to support everything our leader does. Is he not human also? People who expect our president to be perfect are juvenile. They are too simple minded to see the big picture. Americans need to realize that they DON'T know all of what is going on, they need to support our troops by POSITIVE TALK, and most of all, they need to support our leader, the good ol' George W.\n\nI sound way too conservative in this, haha,\n\nID#: 20\n",

About the school shooting, good for the school administrators!  Invasion of privacy my ass, if these kids are stupid enough to document every single detail of their life in public domain (ie anyone can join and read it) then they should get caught.  Schools shouldn't draw any line short of illegally gaining access to online info of their students.  The prevention of the school shooting is proof that this kind of monitoring works.\n\n",
        "    If one school shooting was prevented by delving a little into someone's myspace, that is enough justification for the action. I do not think reading a post that a person intentionally put up on the internet is an invasion of that person's privacy by any means. However, if someone uses illegitimate means to collect information that was never permissably released by the person being researched, that is a breach of privacy. School officials should not attempt to access private information about any student. On the other hand, any publicly posted information (such as myspace, facebook, etc.), in my opinion, can be legitimately used for any good reason by anyone.\n",
        "Any material that any person posts on the world wide web is no longer private property.  It's as simple as that.  Anyone has the right to look at someone else's web page or myspace page.  This is one of the things clearly mentioned in by the myspace creators when a person creates an account: the web is not secure and the information that you post will be available for everyone to see.\n\nSchool officials have the same rights as everyone else, and therefore they had evey right to look at the student's myspace.  Whenever a school official receives any kind of information or indication of violence it must be investigated.  The purpose of the school is to educate its students.  But how can the sudents learn unless they feel safe in their environment.  Therefore one of the top priorities of the school has to be safety, and this priority is vastly more important than the individual privacy rights of the students.  That is why school officials are allowed to search students' lockers (lockers which are school property after all).\n",
        "\nI am all for gay rights. They should have every right that any\nheterosexual person has. However, marriage is a sacrament of the Church; a\nspiritual bond between a man and a woman recognizable by God through the\neyes of the Church. It is not that the Church does not accept gay people,\nit does not look favorably on gay acts hence the fact that they would not\nsupport gay marriage. I do not support gay marriage but I do support gays\nbeing together like a married couple. They just have to use a different\nword besides marriage. I do not understand why it is important for the gay\ncommunity to be \"married\" in the eyes of the Church, an institution that\nhas made it clear that they do not support their way of life. The states\nthat have legalied gay marriage I think are over stepping their bounds. I\nthink this is between the gay community and the Church not Bush and not\nthe States. I think Bush should have nothing to do with this issue. He is\nimposing his personal views on the subject on the entire country which is\nwrong and unjust. Gay marriage has nothing to do with the federal\ngovernment. However, if the gay community decided to use another word and\nbe recognized by the state as a couple, then I think it would be alright\nfor the State to step in and legalize it or not legalize it and for the\nFederal Gov to support it or not.\n\n",
        "Privacy vs. safety, personal rights vs. collective security, these are\nextremely pressing issues in today's day in age, when a large portion of\nthe world honestly detests many aspects of America.

        "I think the Catholic Church has been in a constant process of growth ever since its conception.  It's not like it has never changed - The Protestant Reformation and Vatican II are examples of two massive overhauls in Church doctrine and practice.  Yet there are lots of issues today that the Church is not addressing properly - tradition is not a good answer to the issue of women preists or gay marriage.  It doesn't attract people to the church when they hear that women can't be priests because 2000 years ago people were not enlightened enough to listen when women spoke in the name of Jesus, so he picked men as his apostles instead.  Everyone knows that that has changed, and they want the church to reflect the new status of women in the world.\n\nPope John Paul II did well in his time as Pope to bring the Church into the new millenium.  He made the Church more accessible to common people, and by visiting other countries as a sort of ambassador, in effect globalized it.  In this era of global trade and world economy, it was good to have a Pope who spoke the languages of so many people, and who showed obvious love for each one of them.  But the doctrines of the church are much more entrenched and hard to change than its public image.  Supporters of strict laws in the church can find evidence anywhere in the Bible supporting their ideas.  But perception of the Bible has also changed over the years - it is no longer accepted by many as literal fact, ever since the Scopes Monkey trial.  In fact, among many theologians and Biblical scholars, it is widely accepted that the Bible should be viewed realistically - as a book of meaninful stories and lessons created by Church leaders to unify and teach their followers.  If the Bible were to be created today by the same leaders of the church, it would undoubtedly be different in many, many ways.  So why should we keep basing our lives on the \"laws\" written in a book centuries ago, in another place and time entirely?  The MESSAGE of the Bible is what's important.  Love your neighbor, do unto others as you would have them do unto you, God loves you etc, not \"a man is unclean for 24 hours after he has lain with a woman.\"  That one went out the window... so whats keeping the law where gays should be shunned and stoned taken as the word of God himself?\n\nIn regard to the issue of pedophilia, there is nothing the church could have done or changed to prevent that.  A pedophile is a pedophile - it is a psycholigical illness, not just repressedsexual energy.  I think that rather than a good proportion of priest becoming pedophiles, a good portion of pedophiles became priests to try and control their urges.  They probably thought the church would give them stronger morals and convictions, and that they would be able to control their thoughts and actions better as priests.  Instead, what it did was give them even less supervision (hey, everyone trusts a priest) and even more freedom to be alone with small children and to fantasize about them.  Allowing female priests and married priests would probably enhance the quality of life among priests, but would not make any greater or smaller percentage of them pedophiles.  What the church could have done was to keep a closer watch on the health of its priests.  I'm sure none of them entered the priesthood saying \"Oh boy, this will give me a chance to have sex with kids.\"  They probably felt extreme guilt over their feelings and actions, and probably would have sought help for it if they thought they would be supported.  I'm sure none of these men were particularly bad people, they just had psychological problems and a lack of control.  If priests could be assured that they could get psychological help whenever they needed it, and not necessarily from other priests but from real doctors, then I think the incidence rate of occasions like this would go down.  Also, the curch should not have covered up incidences when they did occur, but gotten help for the involved priests and let the public know in a timely manner.  Instead, the whole thing backfired on them and the newspapers got to have a grand expose.  The church should change many of its own internal customs and rules, and that includes trying to always be judge and jury.  Sometimes people just need outside help.\n",
        "The war in Iraq must be stopped immediately. Since the war on terror began way back in 2003 only more terror has been sustained in Iraq.  The streets of bagdad are more dangerous than ever, and bombings and killings have only increased as our military occupation has been prolonged.  With our \"new plan\" in place to send even more troops over and to refuel our military reserves here in the states, one can only imagin just how many good american will be lost in this trivial act of self affirmation that our president has embarked upon in the middle east.  But what happens when this is over, ok so iraq might not be a threat any longer but terror sure as hell will be.  Iran, North Korea, Lebenon, Lybia, to name a few are all terror driven countries that have more military power than Iraq and still have militaristic dictators in charge.    The war in Iraq has gone on long enough, it has become a quagmire only comparable now to Vietnam and our presidents record low appoval ratings fairly accurately depict the state of the union.\n",
        "I am in favor of the legalization of gay marriage, and I support states like Massachusetts that have passed laws to allow it.  Vermont and New Jersey, allow civil unions between two gay people, but refrain from giving it the title of \"marriage.\"  These states are taking the important steps in the fight against discrimination and the fight for equality among all different groups of people.\n\nThis is not the first time that the government has restricted the rights of its citizens to marry.  Before the Civil War, American citizens could not marry slaves.  But even after the Civil War, there were several state laws that banned marriage between white people and African Americans.  Some of these contiued into the late 20th century.  When my aunt married a black man in the early 1980's, it took a long time before all the members of my family actually accepted the marriage and welcomed her husband into the family.  I can't help but see in the opposition to gay marriage yet another form of discrimination manifesting itself in the American public.\n\nThere should not be an amendment to the Constitution that bans gay marriage.   I think that the President has much more important things to worry about, like National Security and the war that he started in Iraq.  I think questions of marriage should be left up to the states.\n",
        "This is possibly the biggest waste of the court's time ever.  I fail to see, time and time again, how a bulletin posted on a public website for tens and probably hundrends of users to see could be considered private in any way shape or form.  Even just signing up for a Myspace, you are informed that your website is subject to inspection and censorship by the owners - no part of myspace is truly private.  The very act of posting a bulletin shows that he didn't want his actions to be private - he wanted others to know about and read about them.  The issue here is that the wrong people (school officials) came across a notice that was otherwise public property.  You can't defend your mistake of not being careful by saying they invaded your privacy by catching you in that mistake.  If the post was on a private, password protected site that only you had the keys to and shool officials hacked in, then a case could be made.  Still, kids post things every day in their web sites and blogs and expect other people to read them.  The inference of the kid posting a bulletin was that he expected other people to read it.  Just because he got in trouble when people fulfilled his expectations doesn't give him a justification for his defense.\n\nSchool officals should draw the line at actual private property.  Search and seizure of a purse's contents is different from a review of a student's public website.  With a purse, there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.  A purse is used outside of school in many situations.  Myspace is not used for anything but communication with other people. \nNoone creates a Myspace and adds no friends and just keeps it for themselves to look at, and noone posts a bulletin on Myspace without expecting other users to read it.  It's the same situation as passing out fliers at school that say \"IM BRINGING IN A GUN TOMORROW!!!\"  If a school principal happens to pick one up and freaks out, you can't say \"Hey, you had no right to read that because I was only passing it out to my friends!\"  The fact is, the responsibility of school offials to keep the students in their care safe has always and will always outweigh the privacy rights of students.  School officals have more leniency even than the police because a school is supposed to be a safe and sheltered environment.  If kids think they are constantly in danger, how can they learn?  If parents don't think offials are doing a good enough job, they will switch their kids to a different school.  Parents and the government support the school system in doing what it takes to protect their children.  Anything brought to school should be under the authority of the school to search - purses, backpacks, locker contents, notebooks... bottom line, if you don't want it to be seen by school officials don't put it withink their reach.  This means realizing that school officials use the internet as well, and even if they don't other students may turn you in.  This was just a stupid decision by one kid that school officials were well within their rights to crack down on.\n\n",
        "Well, I do not think it is the church, but more the people within the church. Honestly, there are corrupt people everywhere. I think that the pedophilia issues created a bad image for the church...there are so many good priests, and these twisted men just ruined it. I think that the church has adapted its ways to conform to the 21st century. I don't think that we should have female priests though. I have grown up with the idea of male priests and it would just be weird if it were anything different. Like on the show 7th Heaven..I find it weird that the the daughter Lucy is a minister! I do not think that these acts could have been avoided. You cannot change the way people are born, people cannot be tested for a pedophile gene just like they cannot be tested for a gene that will make them a rapist. The question could be found in the pool of people that become priests. Maybe we are recruiting the wrong type of men?\n",
        "The side that has banned gay marriage is wrong for many reasons.  Governments originally came to be to protect man and enforce a basic set of moral laws so that safety could florish.  The governments today, waging such issues as gay marriage, have long since over-stepped their bounds.  Marriage, no matter what, is characterized by love and if two human beings, regardless of gender, love each other then the marriage is one hundred percent justified.  The government should have a role in protecting its citizens but this is a case of impedance where the government is taking away that right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nIf the Church wishes to ban that marriage, so be it, their views are very much outdated as it is.  There is no reason that a society should ban a legal bond between two gay spouses because they have every right as human beings to pursue a life that they see fit.  Of all sectors of the government, the Federal government is the last one who should step in if the government should even be able to ban such a thing.  To say that an entire country of people, billions of people, can not legally be in love in this territory is completely close-minded and stands against all this country was founded on.  The United States has come to stand for a place where people can be themselves and live a life of freedom; and here is George Bush trying to take all of those promises of this great country away from the citizens.\n\nFurthermore, there has been scientific data showing that people with homosexual tendencies are born with those tendencies.  To try and govern something so natural, something people are born with in their genetic coding, is unnatural and unjustified.  We do not ban people with disabilities from part of society just because they were born that way.  Each and every person in this country and on this planet is unique and was born with unique traits and characteristics.  A government filled with conservative, like-minded, and ignorant people should not have the ability to make something illegal when it is part of an individual's genetic make-up and personal choice.\n\n",
        "This is a hard example of privacy rights because on one hand I want to say that school officials should not invade privacy through myspace and facebook among other things. But in this case, the school officials seeing the bulletin prevented a terrible thing from happening. I think that it is an invasion of privacy to go looking at things with the intent to get people in trouble, however if something is brought to their attention they shoul be able to look at it. Anything that you would not want an administrator to see should not be on the internet where anyone can see it.\n",
        "\nI do think gender discrimination still exists but its not as one sided as\nit used to be. Back in the day gender discrimination was mainly emphasized\ntoward women. Women could only have jobs as secretaries or jobs that\nrequired helping; no real authority. Now I believe both men and women are\ndiscriminated against because of their gender. I see this in the fact that\nmen are looked down upon if they want to be a stay at home dad or work as\na secretary or a nurse. Why do men always have to have the power? For\nexample I would like to be a nurse practioner in the emergency room, and\nmy main reason for wanting to be a nurse practioner instead of a doctor is\nbecause I don't want all the responsibility and I want to have a family\nand a life outside of my career. I feel like men can't want what I want,\nthey can't not want responsiblity and authority afterall isn't that what\nis ingrained in our heads as a child, men are the head of the household,\nthey bring in the money.\nOn the opposite spectrum women are also discriminated against in the\nworkplace but its not as obvious. There are laws now that prevent women\nfrom  being discriminated against but that doesn't mean that people don't\nfind ways to get around those laws. I believe that women in most\nconservative businesses have to work twice as hard as men do who have the\nsame criteria as they do in order to reach there level. But this is only\nlooking at movies and the media which is what I base most of my knowledge\non being that I have never been discriminated against nor anyone I know.\n\n",

I believe that Bush is trying the colonize\nIraq and make it a middle  east U.S. I believe that Bush figures its a\nwin-win situation, the Iraqis will have protection from anyone that tries\nto harm them and the U.S. will have control over their oil, which we so\ndesperately need. If Bush hasn't come up with a set plan on what he is\ngoing to do with Iraq he needs to give them back control of their country.\nWhich I believe is even more detrimental to the U.S. because we will\nprobably be leaving there country in shambles. No government, no schools,\nno resources to live off and begin a new a life. What are they going to do\nif we leave? But if we stay I feel like we will be over there for years to\ncome because Bush would most likely want to give them a democratic\ngovernment which is probably unheard of over there. In a democratic\ngovernment that would give women equal rights, what would they do if that\nhappended?!?! All-in-all im kind of stuck in the middle on my position on\nthe war, I believe the U.S. should pull out but I don't want another 9/11\nbecause of it.\n\n",

They have already modified\nthe fasting laws and the age that people are allowed to fast. I think that\nthere is no reason why women should not be able to further themselves by\nbecoming priests. They even had women priests in Jesus' day. Women are\nequal to men in this society and if the Church refuses to recognize that\nthen I think they are up against a very large community of angry women. I\nalso understand that priest take an oath to be faithful and married to\nGod, however, I do not understand why God would not want them to\nexperience the joys of married and family life and for them to share God\nwith their families. I think it would only benefit the Catholic communtiy\nseeing the priest with his family and how they act. It would be a good\nmodel for the community.

        "Oh boy.  This is one of the few topics that I myself am divided on.  Not\ngay marriage, but the very issue of homosexuality itself.  As for gay\nmarriage, I'm all for it.  Why?  Because I don't care what the homosexuals\ndo.  Why should I?  Why should I care what anybody does except for myself\nas long as what they do does not hurt me personally?  I dunno.  I've been\ntrying to figure out why conservatives care so much.  Don't they have\nbetter things to do than to worry about the \"gay problem?\"  If your\nparticular church thinks that gay marriage is wrong, then they can decide\nnot to allow it.  If you believe in gay marriage, then this church is\nprobably not the one for you, because it clearly goes against your morals.\n So join another church that supports your beliefs.  Just cuz the catholic\nchurch is the oldest, doesn't mean it's right.  Now let's say your the\npresident of the country and you believe gay marriage is wrong.  GOOD FOR\nYOU.  Believe what you will. But don't try to ban gay marriage in the\nconstitution.  That's the stupidest goddamn thing I've ever heard.  First\nof all, the constitution is about ensuring rights not taking them away,\ndumbass.  Second of all, keep your religion to yourself.  You have no\nplace to make legislation about religious matters.  I can't stress how\nstupid of a move this is.  Really.  Our president is completely\nincompetent.\nHow do I feel about homosexuality in general?  I think it's wrong. \nPersonally, I believe that homosexuality is either a way to receive\nattention that one normally might not receive, or simply a chemical\nimbalance in the brain thats the cause of too much or too little estrogen\nor testosterone.  I absolutely do not believe gay people are \"born\" to be\ngay.  However, does this mean I have a problem with gay people? \nAbsolutely not.  Go and get married, go play with each other, I don't\ncare.  It's your fundamental right to do what you want, as long as you\ndon't affect me.  Hell, all it is less competition.\n",
        "   I do believe that the catholic chruch needs to update its criteria a\nlittle bit. Being an avod catholic myself, I do not think that it is\nright to not allow priests to marry. This is actually cutting\ndrastically into our religion, because more and more people who are\nordaned are also wanting to become priests, but find themselves being\ndicons instead, and thus can not preform all of the sacraments.\n  In jeasuses time, priests were allowed to be married and there are no\nrules in the Bible that prevent such men from entering into a\nrelationship with a woman, getting married and having a family. This is\na man made law. It dates back to the time when the roman catholic church\nwas corrupt and the popes...yes there were sometimes more then\none...would act only in their own intersests and ignor the rightful\nteachings of God.\n   However, we have come a long way from this point in our lives, and have\ndemonstrated that we can all now act as one and follow the teachings of\nGod. It is thus time to allow priest so enter into marraige and be able\nto have a family. It would actually be good for them to have families\ntoo, because if they truly are rasining them in the eyes of the Lord,\nthen they are setting a good example for others to follow and model\nafter as.\n   I believe that if priest were allowed to marry there would probably\nalso have been a decrease in the indecencey of gay relationships or\nchild mulestation. Men are known to have needs that they try and\nfulfill. Unfortunatly by denying them the right to enter into marraige,\nthey are finding other outlets to \"relieve\" themselves. THis is\ncompleatly and utterly gastly and harmful, not only to the individuals\ninvolved, but to those around them who know these people in person and\nto the church itself.\n  It is my thought that the church handled this entire situation\nexceedinly poorly because they were in a way just too shocked to really\nfully grasp the entire situation and know what was going on. instead\nthey felt that covering up the harmulf deed or removing one of the\nindividuals to another locations..ofthen the priest, would solve the\nproblem. It didn't of course, because the needs of that priest were\nstill there, so instead he just succeeded in hurting more people around\nhim instead of teaching others in the way of the Lord.\n   THis is why priest should be able to marry and this is why the curch\nneeds to recognize the problems they are faced with.\n   women should also be able to become priests, because who is to say that\nonly men are able to teach others ih the way of the lord? I certainly\nknow plenty of women who love to talk about God and know more then many\npriests or know just as much as priest now adays. Perhaps if women\ncould be priest, this would also help eliminate the shortage of\npriests, and maybe even attract others to listen to the word, knowing\nthat it treates both sexes equally, just as the Bible tells us to do.\n\n",
        "I think gender discrimination absolutely still exists in our country, but not at the same level of intensity that it once was. There are many men today who still feel that women belong \"in the kitchen.\" Many times it is said in a joking way, but there is still some sense of truth to it in their minds. In the workplace, men often feel that women are not good enough, and are not able to accomplish the same things that they are. Women are looked at as sexual beings and not much more. However, many men have seen discrimination too. The idea of \"Mr.Mom\", a stay at home dad with a woman as the main source of income is not at all uncommon, but still men who choose this as their profession are ridiculed.\n\n",
        "I do not know which side to agree with. I am a straight Catholic girl. My grandmother condemns homosexuality,I guess being Catholic I should to, but I feel that people should be able to express themselves however they want to.If I were attracted to women, then yes I would be very upset with President Bush, but I'm not. I don't think it is right of Mr. Bush to push for an amendment to ban gay marriage. I am not totally comfortable with it, because it is so different to me, but I feel that in situations like these, you just have to put yourself in the other persons shoes. What if straight marriages were banned? What if the norm was gay marriage? And I was the odd one out? I would be very upset. I am not going to get up and rally about it, but I do sympathize for the people who are denied marriage. Isn't the federal government involved in most things anyways? So, sure, they can be involved here too.\n",

It is not worth risking my brother's life and the lives of all the other military we have over there for the little progress we are making in the country.

In allowing priests to marry, the church most likely could have prevented the occurrances of pedophilia because they would have had a way to express themselves sexually and in an appropriate manner. The Catholic church is still operating in pretty much the same manner and under the same system it has since its creation, and considering how far society as a whole has come, the Catholic church should greatly considering modernizing with the times. You don't really see these same types of problems in other denominations of Christianity, so I think this goes to show that modernizing would benefit the Catholic Church more than harm it.\n",
        "Dear CMCC Study-\n\nThe federal debate over gay marriage is asinine. Constitutionally speaking, I believe it's a matter which should be left to the States.\n\nMy feelings about President Bush cannot be described in polite terms, so I won't go there.\n\nThe erroneous line of reasoning that concludes that the banning of gay marriage will protect \"family values\" is also absurd in itself. First of all, in order to follow this logic, one has to first posit that there is a coherent standard for what can be considered \"family values.\" This ignores the plethora of cultural norms and values present in American society, and therefore begins on false premises. Second, the conservative push for \"family values\" is ridiculous in itself. Mark Foley, anyone? Government funding for South American countries to slaughter their own peoples during the Reagan Administration? Economic policies which consistently widen the gap between the top and bottom of the wage-earning spectrum? These don't really jive with any notion of \"family values.\"\n\nOur country is predominantly homophobic. The ability for gays to get married in civil ceremonies wouldn't have have any practical negative consequences for our country. The right would involve just that: civil ceremonies. People can go on holding whatever uptight ideas they please within their own religions, which have nothing to do with government sanctioned unions.\n\nPeace,\n#6\n\n",
        "\nI believe the catholic church has lost there way, No longer is church\nabout serving the poor and helping those who need spiritual guidance, its\nbasically a way for people to point out whose wrong and whose right. Now\ngranted this is the way I see it as the Catholic Church as the whole but\nupon interacting with a few Jesuit priests here at Loyola this notion is\nsteadily changing. Actually these priests at Loyola I belive are the new\nwave of priests who are adapting Catholism to college students in a way\nthat they will understand. Because I know personally I struggle with\nunderstanding the Bible, and the priests here put the Bible in general\nterms that can be adapted to college life. I believe that even Catholism\nis finding it hard to live strictly according to the Bible so why not\nchange it according today's lifestyle. Or even make more general statments\ninstead of being so specific. I feel like God will be ok with the fact\nthat we are praying and understanding the Bible. I believe that Bible\nwasnt meant for us to understand every little thing but so that we could\nbe able to relate to it and find God in it. How can we do that if we are\nconstantly worrying about the little things?\n\nI dont think the Catholic Church should change anything marriage wise for\nthe priests because it sets the Catholic Church apart from all the other\nreligions. But what I do question is are the people that commit these\ncrimes really meant to become priests? Are they mistaken in their calling?\nI believe that God provides for every and anything we need, so if these\npriests are commiting these crimes maybe God is showing them that they\nneed to chose a different profession. Granted  arousal is a very strong\nurge that humans can get, however if they were really meant to be priests\nwouldn't God suffice for this urge?\n\n",
        "I definitely think that gender discrimination is an issue in present-day United States.  There are certainly obvious differences between men and women.  I think that although women have come a long way in terms of being less discriminated against than in the past, they stil face much discrimination.  The roles that have typically been associated with women in the past has lead to stereotypes which still exist today.  I think that the root of this gender discrimination comes from stereotypes.  Until these stereotypes are completely eliminated (which I don't really think will ever happen), I'm not really sure what can be done to change this.  My best guess would be to say for everyone just to try to keep as open a mind as possible and never to assume that a man or a woman could do a certain task better.  As women keep proving that in most cases they are just as qualified to do a certain task as a man is, then maybe over time, the stereotypes will start to lessen and, possibly eventually, go away. One of the main places in which I feel that gender discrimination occurs is in the workplace.  Studies have shown that often in situations where men and women are performing the exact same job, the man makes a higher salary.  I find this completely unfair.  If two people are performing exactly the same job duties, there should be no difference in their salary based simply on gender.  There is also the situation that we hear about of the \"glass ceiling\".  This is where women and look up and see the men above them, but they can't actually get to that point themselves.  While there are certainly women in high positions in business and management, most of the TOP officers are men.  Again, I am not saying that this is ALWAYS the case, but this situation does occur quite frequently.  The way I see it, there is no real reason for this other than gender discrimination.  I believe that women could do equally as well a job as men.  Howwomenever, this bring up another issue.  If women were to hold these top positions, then they would inevitably be \"bosses\" to both men and women alike.  Since stereotypes and discrimination do exist though, the woman could be less effective at her job, since some of the men might not respect her or follow her orders as much as they would if a man was their boss.  An example that I have of this is from my friend.  Her dad works in an office where his boss is a woman.  He is extremely resentful of this fact, and I have heard him make comments about her several times while I have been at the house.  Now I am sure that she can perform the regular job duties equally as well as a man in her position, but here is a situation where one of her employees does not hold the same respect for her as she deserves. I also think that women are discriminated against in situations where physical strenght is required.  Yes, it is a fact that women are built differently than men.  Most men tend to be bigger and stronger than women. But again, this is not always the case.  Personally, I know that I am rather weak in comparision with males my age, but I know girls who are stronger than some of the guys.  So if there is a woman who possesses great physical strength and would like to do a job that requires physical strength (ex: military, firefighter, police officer, etc.) then I believe\nthat they should be allowed to. I don't really think that men face the same sort of discrimination as women do.  The only type of discrimination that I can think of off the top of my head that males face would be that they would be \"tougher\" than women.  Generally, personality-wise, the stereotype is that men are \"tough\" and women are more emotional.\n",
        "    I do not feel like gender discrimination, collectively, is an issue in the present-day U.S.  There may be examples of discrimination here and there, but I think the vast majority of employers do not use gender discrimination.  In this day and age, it is simply not wise for employers to practice gender discrimination.  If it is apparent that they are doing this, they will find themselves facing a lawsuit that they are likely to lose.  It just makes good business sense to be an equal opportunity employer.\n    I do think that women use gender discrimination as a crutch in modern society.  Many women want to be equal in every way, shape, and form as men.  Biology will teach us, however, that men and women are physically different.  There is no disputing this fact.  As a result, men tend to be stronger than women.  Consequently, there are jobs in which men are preferred over women because the worker needs to be strong.  Man employers who need a strong individual will choose a man over a woman.  This is not because of gender discrimination.  The employer is just being smart.\n    Gender discrimination is a thing of the past.  Employers today don't want to waste their time discriminating against women - they simply want good results.  Sometimes the way to achieve these results is to hie a man - who is stronger - over a woman.\n",
        "We have come a long way toward gender equality in this country, and even\nthough the equal rights amendment failed, even though there is still a\ngender-wage gap, we are much better than we used to be.\n\nWomen are allowed to vote and can hold almost any job men can.  Women\nattend college frequently, right along with men, and then compete for the\nsame jobs.\n\nWe still have some pervasive gender roles involving male \"heads of the\nhousehold\" and female home-makers, but considering how infatuated we were\nwith the \"nuclear family\" idea in the 1950s, we have come a long way. \nThank you Betty Friedan!\n\nSo basically, I don't think gender equality is a terribly pressing\nissue... I know plenty of happy families who choose to forego traditional\ngender roles, and plenty of happy families who adhere to them also.\n",
        "In my opinion, if you are posting something on myspace, it's not private.  Myspace is a site that allows any other person who has an account to access your page, so if a creepy old men are able to acess a myspace page and stalk young girls, then school official should be allowed view the same information. If the student who posted the plan on the site really wanted it to be a secret, he wouldn't have exposed the plan in a place where anyone could have access to it. Also, in doing this, the school was able to prevent a very serious event that could have been fatal for many of its students. If I was attending that school, I would much rather my life be saved by an invastion of privacy, than having the school mind its own business and I not  make it home from school that day. I think that doing such things as searching students backpacks and lockers is an invasion of privacy, but if you are spilling your business on a public online site, you are just asking to get caught.\n",
        "Gender discrimination is still a big issue in the present-day United States.  It is hard to ever fully recover from a great disparity.  Just as African Americans were once oppressed and continue to face discrimination, so will women have a difficult time being seen as equals to their male counterparts.  With a history of inferiority, women still remain somewhat inferior to men, in the workplace and outside the workplace.  More college graduates are female than male, yet men hold higher paying positions on average.  This discrepancy is the result of years of gender discrimination, and it would be hard to deny that this discrimination is still an issue today.  Men are sometimes discriminated against as well, but not in the workplace.  They would face challenges when attempting to take on a traditionally female role, such as that of the homemaker or caretaker of children.  Both men and women face discrimination because the genders, even in modern America, are not viewed as equal and still tend to define roles and jobs.  This is a difficult problem to fix, and it will take a long time to overcome traditional views of gender inequality.  The best thing to do is keep an open mind about the roles of men and women and challenge others to do the same.\n",
        "Well, the war certainly is a big issue. As of now, I have no family over in Iraq, nor any close to me. I feel safer knowing that our troops are over in Iraq, honestly, I do not know if they are making a difference, but my biggest fear would be, battles here on the U.S. When I speak to people who have visited Iraq, it freightens me..the thought that this could happen here. I would rather the fighting be over seas then on our land. I guess it is selfsih, but it is the truth. I have two brothers, both eligible if there were to be a draft. Now, if that ever happened I would strongly oppose our troops in Iraq. I would never be able to live with the thought of my brothers fighting over there. I would be happier knowing that they are ok, here with me. As for the length of the war, just keep it away from our lands. I feel bad for those who have died, but they did a good thing, they kept people like me who would never dream of being there safe.\n",
        "    The Catholic Church is one of the most conservative and regressive groups in the world.  They act like they are separate from the rest of civilization.  For one, the Cathiolic Church is not inclusive when it comes to other groups.  For example, they are entirely opposed to gay people as a people, let alone allowing them to marry.  They like to downplay their views against it, but it is a fact that they see homosexuality as a sin.  Could you imagine being considered a sinner for having curly hair?  Homosexuality is a genetic trait, not a life choice.  The Catholic Church either does not understand this, or does not care to know the truth.  Thee reason for this, in my opinion, is that they are afraid to admit they were wrong for taking such a hard stance against homosexuality.  They try to doctrinize everything they say or do, because after all, the pope is infallible, right?  The Catholic Church is such a backwards organization.  Whatever they proclaim, others must accept - no questions asked.\n    In today's world, science plays an enormous role.  In the scientific community, one must have evidence to support one's conclusion.  Not so with the Catholic Church.  They say things are the way they are because \"God said so.\"  This method of thinking is completely ridiculous.  No one even knows if there is a God to begin with.  The Catholic Church could be living in a fantasy world. \n    The Catholic Church has a dogma known as \"transsubtantiation.\"  According to this dogma, the eucharistic bread and wine is actually the body and blood of Jesus Christ - not a symbol thereof.  No one is going to tell me that bread and wine magically becomes human flesh and blood when a priest consecrates it.  It can be a symbol, but it is still bread and wine.\n    The entire pedophilia scandal confuses me.  Why have so many priests been guilty of molesting young boys?  There is a definite trend, but I need to know the reason why before I can come to a conclusion.  My feeling is that any human being, priest or not, needs some form of sexual satisfaction.  That is simply that way the human body is.  For priests, who are required to stay celibate, the easiest way to get this satisfaction without anyone knowing about it, is to molest young boys.  If priests were allowed to marry, they would be fully able to satisfy their carnal desires.  But no, the Catholic Church still relies upon the teachings of St. Augustine, who said that taking pleasure in sex in sinful.  Its 2006.  Let priests marry.  They would be happier, and they wouldn't be so inclined to molest boys.  Wanting to have sex is not a sin - its human nature.  But apparently the Catholic Church is above human nature too.\n",
        "\n   One the issue of gay marriage, I belive that it should not be leaglied.\nNow let me first clarify what I mean by this. Marragie in the eyes of\nthe church is between a man and a woman before god. Those of the same\nsex can not participate in such actions because the Bible and the\ncatholic church do not recognize this form of unionization to be legal.\nThe reason is because a man and a woman can produce children and thus\nhelp populate the world and spread the word of God.\n  Those of the same sex can not produce children having the same organ\nsystem makeup, and thus are not considered a compleate whole or union in\nthe eyes of the Lord. I compleatly agree with this, however I do belived\nthat those of the same sex should be able to spend the rest of thier\nlives together and have the same governmental benifits as regular\nfamilies.\n  In other words, I belive that those who are of the same sex should be\nunionized but in a different way. If they so wish they can have their\npartnersip recognized by a new name as well other then marraige (because\nit is not a marraige) but have it sound more meaningful then just the\ndry term of civil union.\n   In reality, this is mainly what most same sex partners want anyways.\nTHey want a way to solidify thier \"love\" for one another in the eyes of\nothers, and they want to be able to acces all of the benifits that\nnormal male female relationships and marragiaes have.\n   In regards to whether President Bush should be allowed to pass an\nAmendment banning Gay marraige, I do not think that this should be\ndone. I again, dont think that there should be gay marraige (as said\nusing this term) but under a different term I am ok with it. However,\nwith President Bush passing an Amendment banning gay marraige it is\nalmost making it seem that one is not free in this country any more.\nONe should be able to choose who they wish to spend the rest of thier\nlife with and not have to worry how others judge them. with an\namendment, even if they did find a way to solidify thier union working\naround the amendment, I feel as if they would be looked down upon even\nmore in society then it is already today, and this should not be so.\n  THe Federal government should not be involved in people's personal lives\nin regards to stating who is allowed to be involved or be partnered with\nwho. If this were the case in the end, I fear that the book by George\nOrwell of 1984 would be coming to life with the \"Big Brother or Father\"\nthing going on.\n  Oh, on another point, the reason why marraige between a man and a woman\nis more solidifying in the eyes of god, is because they are able to\nreproduce and thus even if the initial \"passion\" for one another dies\nout, they have children that they are now working together to rais in\nthe eyes of the Lord. THose of the same sex can not do this and so\nofthen thier relationships tend to dye out after the passion has gone\naway.\n  To sum up what I belive, I believe that those of the same sex should be\nable to be unionized under a different term then marraige and taht the\nfederal government and president bush should stay out of the sistuation.\nI also believe that once this universal differnt term to name the union\nbetween same sex couples is passes, all states should honor it.\n\n\n\n",
        "I am one hundered percent for gay marraige. I think when two people want to get married, no matter who the two people are they should be allowed to do so. I think it is wrong to say that they cant. Who is President Bush to say that there are some people in the United States that are not allowed to be together? The federal government should not have any more of a say in this type of marriage that they do in any other.\n",
        "I do feel as though gender discrimination is still very much a part of our scociety today.  Men still have the inner path to success weather our coorporations want to admit it or not.  The sporting world also sees a great deal of gender descrimination.  Women sports do not get as much regognition national or globaly.  Women athletes only make a small percentage of what men athletes make and in individual sports such as tennis or golf the winners of the LPGA and womens tennis events often take home much smaller winnings than that or their male counterparts.  Women have been given a disadavantage in the working world that stems back for centuries, however, now more than ever the tides of change have been rolling in.  It is my belief that within the next 20 years women will share in equall oppertunities that men do within coorprate america. \n     As for reverse gender descrimination, I feel as though it is only present in certain professions such as nursing.  As many movies like to portray, nursing used to be a female dominated profession.  It still is a female heavy job but it does employ many men now.\n",
        "    First off, the internet is a public place.  If you can access information, then by all means, go ahead.  It is your right as an American citizen to look up information that you are authorized to see.\n    Furthermore, what are the negative consequences of schools or government organizations monitoring public web sites?  If you aren't doing anything illegal, then what is the problem?  If you are doing illegal things, like planning a school shooting, then it looks as if \"invasion of privacy\" is a good thing after all.\n    The Patriot Act falls somewhat into this category.  This act is designed to protect us.  No one cares about information that might be embarrassing to a certain person.  The NSA monitors phone conversations that contain key words linked to the possibility of terrorist action.  The analysts who monitor these calls don't care about individual people.  They are simply doing their jobs protecting lives.\n    People need to grow up and stop worrying about their privacy being breached because certain examples like the one above have shown that it only makes us safer when other people seek out and monitor certain media.\n",
        "Dear CMC Study,\n\nAs with any institution that's been around for millenia (okay, granted, that's the only one I can think of offhand), the Catholic Church is essentially a conservative body which resists any change. This can be seen as a blessing and a curse, but lately it's mostly been a curse. The concerns that the Church served through its current structure died out over a hundred years ago, and relatively little has been done to make that structure relevant since. In order for it to stay alive through the 21st century, I think some major changes are needed. \nI think allowing priests to marry and ordaining female priests would be a step in the right direction, if not the end in itself. The Church is set up like a self-monitering fraternity right now, and as we've seen that hasn't worked out too well (and hasn't prove nearly as funny as, say, \"Animal House\").\n\nQuick Handy-dandy Guide to becoming a married Catholic Priest:\n1. Get married.\n2. Attend an Anglican or Episcopalian seminary and become ordained into\none of those sects.\n3. Several months later, experience a \"conversion\" and decide you want to become a Catholic.\n4. Because of the preponderance of doctrinal similarities between the sects, the Catholic Church will accept you, marriage and all, as a full-fledged priest in the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nI just thought I'd throw that in.\n\nPeace,\n#6\n",
        "I think that whenever you post anything on the internet, you have to be aware that what you are posting can be read by pretty much anyone.  If there is something that you don't want EVERYONE to be able to see, then you should think twice before posting that information.  So if you put something online in your mySpace, you should know that MANY MANY people will be able to see it.  For this reason, I don't really think that it was an invasion of privacy for someone from the school to have read a bullitin that indicated there was going to be a shooting.  If the student posted this information on the internet for all to see, then they should have been aware that it is possible for anyone to read it.  I don't personally have a mySpace profile, so I am not exactly sure how the privacy settings work.  I can only speak from my experience with a Facebook profile.  I do have a Facebook, and I have currently have my settings so that only \"friends of my friends\" at Loyola can see my profile.  So if accept a friend request from someone, any of their friends who go to Loyola will be able to see my profile as well.  I initially had it set up so that anyone at Loyola could see my profile, but I recently restricted it further.  There are stil a large number of people that fall into the category of \"friends of my friends.\" So I know though, that any information that I post on my profile can be viewed by many different people.  It is sometimes tricky to figure out what information I want to post, and what I don't.  For example, I have my AOL Instant Messenger screen name and my campus address on my Facebook profile.  This information is posted because I would like people from my classes or my friends on campus to be able to contact me or to stop by my room. However, I don't really want EVERYONE in the world to know my screen name or where I live on campus, because that is kind of dangerous.  But I am taking that risk by posting that information online. So if a student posts something online, the information is available to a wide group of people.  If a student has written something threatening about a school shooting, then I think that it is great that a school official happened to see it and was able to prevent lives being lost.  I'm not sure how exactly the school official came across the student's message though.  It would be kind of weird WHY exactly the school official was looking at students' profiles anyway, but I am glad that they were able to save lives.\n\n",
        "Well first off, let me start off by saying I don't really care at all what\nthe Catholic Church decides to do.  I've already decided for myself that\nreligion is not something I'm interested in being a part of, and would\nrather not hear anything about religion for the rest of my life.  That\nbeing said, my responses can be put into the context of a nonbeliever.\n\nShould the Catholic Church have to change it's ways to adapt to 21st\ncentury life? I don't personally know if they need to.  What I mean is, Is\nthe Church's popularity waning? I'm not really up to date on the numbers\nbut it seems as if they are still holding strong in Europe and growing\nexponentially in Africa and Latin America.  In the U.S., it's hard for me\nto say, especially since I go to a Catholic school, where there are\nCatholics everywhere.  If they really are in need of some kind of change,\nwe have to look at the process of change since its conception.  I mean,\nthink how many thousands of years it took just to allow laypeople to read\nthe people.  I'm pretty sure that took over a millenium.  And to allow\ntranslations of the bible, and to accept versions of the Bible as valid\nbesides for their precious Vulgate?  Also took thousands and thousands of\nyears.  However, the main difference between that millenium and this one\nis that people live outside of religion.  What I mean by that is that\nuntil the modern era, God was a generally accepted truth.  Nobody didn't\nbelieve.  Today we have barriers set up between believers and the rest of\nthe world.  It's much easier to attract people to your religion when\neverybody already believes.  So do I think the Church needs to change?\nAbsolutely.  The church is still operating under the idea that the way\nthey worked during the middle ages, the way they worked during the\nrenaissance, still works.  And it doesn't.\n\nUnfortunately, my advice to the Catholic Church is a little too radical\nfor Catholics to accept.  My first piece of advice: Forget the pope. \nReally.  Why is there a pope?  Someone thats holier than all of us? \nSomeone thats between us and God?  Why do you listen to what he says,\nholding on to his words so closely?  He wasn't chosen by God, he was\nchosen by men.  That should probably tell you something right away.  Stop\nmaking people think they need a pope to be in contact with God, cuz it's a\nlie.\n\nThat's really all the advice I have to give to the Catholic Church.  I\nreally don't care what else they do.  I'm just tired of the pope.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "In many ways I do feel that the Catholic Church needs to change its ways. Their current ways of dealing with issues are not acceptable for the 21st century. As for the pedophilia I don't believe that it could have been prevented from changing the church. I do feel however that the church should allow preists to marry. Just becuase they are married it does not mean they aren't dedicated to god.\n\n",
        "I do not feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the present day United States. This may be because I have not been out into the \"real world\". I held a part time job in high school for 5 years and the only time I felt singled out as a girl was when I was unable to work past 7 o'clock. There were two valid reasons that I was not allowed- first, I think 14 year olds are only allowed to work a certain number of hours, and my boss did not want to leave me alone with the older boys working there..because after hours our store was dead! (I'm glad I had that restriction!) Once I became a freshman in high school I was able to work the rest of the night. At this job, I actually felt that the guys were discriminated..girls never got in trouble. The same mistake could be made by both a guy and a girl, and the guy would get fired. Once again..this was my store-very different from most. I mean...I guess I have been taught that there is discrimination towards women..I don't know by who, but I always grew up feeling like women were second best to men. I don't see it and it doesn't affect me. Idealy, I would hope not to even have to get a job when I graduate college. I would love for my husband to make enough money that I can be a stay at home mom!\n",
        "The Catholic Church does need to change its ways to adapt to life in the 21st Century.  This must occur in areas such as social life and scientific endeavours.  Many of their requirements such as no meat on Fridays during Lent or necessary attendance of church once a week have long since lost their true meaning.  The main idea is that people practicing the faith will take in some of the core values of the Catholic Church through these actions; however, they have become what many would describe as monotonous and meaningless.  There should be refreshing and more directly applicable ways to experience the values the church wishes to give to the followers.\n\nIn the realm of science the church especially needs to come to the modern world.  When the church was founded over a millenium ago there was barely an existence of science as we know it today.  Over time, however, there have been great advancements for humans in the field of science revealing many new truths.  Many of these truths actually go against reasoning or \"truth\" the church held early on or had as a part of their religious scripts.  One such example is evolution and the creation of the universe.  There has been great scientific studies proving that evolution exists and that the creation of the universe came about from the Big Bang Theory as opposed to the obviously fictional stories in the Book of Genesis.  I believe there is a loss of credibility when the church refuses to apply reason to such scientific evidence.  It would certainly not take away from their core values and beliefs.\n\nChanges as they pertain to priests should be very minimal.  I believe that the priests, in addition to being officials of the church, are examples for the people practicing the religion to follow.  They are extreme examples in many cases because of the certain vows they take, but nonetheless Catholics can take away less extreme values from the priests to apply to their lives in an effort to aim towards a better life.\n\n",

The only arguments against gay marriage are all based on opinion. No legitimate, objective reasons for making it illegal have been put forth, and that is why the federal government should have no say in the matter.\n",

Lets' just not call\nit marriage, lets call it a civil union.  If two men or two women are in\nlove, they should be able to visit each other in the hospital.

        "What is the purpose of the Church?  What is the role of any religious institution?  I think that religion builds faith, and faith is something that becomes part of a person.  The Catholic Church is a foundation for the lives of many of its members.  Church doctrine and Church teachings remain a source of constancy and stability in a fast-paced, unpredictable world.  The  Church holds many opinions based upon these beliefs and these teachings that find a great of opposition in the 21st century.  The doctrine of the Church is pro-life in all situations; it is against abortion and the death penalty.  I certainly hope that these stances do not change.\n   You see, the foundation and the heart of the Catholic Church is the teachings of Jesus, and these have endured for 2,000 years and hopefully will endure for 2,000 more.  The Church interprets these teachings and applies them to the contemporary world.  This is the role of the Church, a role that I do not think should change.\n    However, The Catholic Church is so much more than doctrine.  The institution of the Church, the hierarchy that governs it, is completely composed of men.  This I do have a problem with.  For an institution that advocates the dignity of every human person and equality among them, where is the dignity and equality within their own walls?\n    It is important to note  however, that women play a very important role on a smaller scale, in the everyday activities of individual parish communities.  Because there is a lack of Catholic priests, lay people in general have taken on more religious and administrative responsibilities, and many of these lay people are women.  But we cannot ignore the fact that women are not allowed to become deacons, priests, bishops, cardinals, or pope.  There are several other religions that allow women to hold positions of leadership.  Protestant Churches have female priests.  I can only see the inclusion of women as beneficial to the Church, especially since there is such a shortage of priests.  Also, I find it much harder to believe that any women would wstand by quietly while they knew a fellow male priest was sexually abusing young children.  Perhaps these atrocities would have been discovered much sooner with women in some sort of position of power.\n    Should priests be allowed to marry?  The Protestant religions allow this.  The Catholic Church in rare circumstances allows this.  For example, if a married Protestant minister converts to Catholicism and wishes to become a priest, he is usually allowed to do so.  Maybe there would be more priests if they were generally allowed to be married.  But I agree with the Catholic Church on this point.  A priest, and any other person who belongs to religious order, must be willing to devote his entire life in service of God and the people of the Church. I just don't think that they would be able to do that if they also had the responsibility of a family.  The teachings of the Catholic Church should not adapt to the fast-paced, self-absorbed world of the 21st century.  But the institution is a few decades behind in the implementation of equality between the sexes.\n",
        "Dear CMC Study,\n\nPlease give me a minute to compose myself...\n\nOkay, the war in Iraq was a monstrously bad idea. I don't see any two ways about it. It's introduced even more instability into a region that wasn't exactly a sterling example of U.S.-friendly feelings to begin with. Furthermore, I think that many of the unacknowledged motivations for the war were economic, and hundreds of thousands of people have died because of those motivations (blood oil in your gasoline tank, anyone?).\n\nI don't think the war should continue. I think the warring factions in Iraq realize that it really isn't to anyone's advantage to continuously fight each other, though this will probably continue to happen for sometime. By many accounts, much of the animosity in Iraq is directed at the occupying forces (us). I think that if we pulled out now, the country would remain unstable for a period, but would move into a relatively calm position within a reasonable amount of time.\n\nAnd the Bush administration should really stop rolling dice when it comes to foreign policy.\n\nPeace,\n#6\n",
        "I don't care whether gay people get married - whatever lifestyle they choose is their decision, so as long as it doesn't harm anybody else, let them do what they want.  However, it might be easier to have the government view marriages as civil unions (just changing the name, not the benefits), as not  to discriminate between one marriage or the other. A constitutional amendmant banning gay marriage is just stupid. I can't fathom why one of the defining documents of the US would be tampered with to deal with such a relatively minor issue. Finally, if all the states agree with the same decision, I don't see how a federal law to some things up would be that bad.\n\n",

        "Dear CMCC Study,\n\nI'll have to try to put aside my strong distaste for myspace for the moment (it's a disgusting excuse for internet voyeurism and cheapens more legitimate forms of human interaction and communication). People need to keep in mind that myspace is an open forum. This means that anything posted on it can be viewed by anyone else. Myspace does have a \"privacy\" option, but I'd argue that anyone who places information they wouldn't want other sot see on the internet is asking for trouble.\n\nI think that since myspace is an open forum, school officials were within their rights to use the information they found posted. The student who was dumb enough to make the posting acted the same as if he had posted it on a regular billboard in a hallway somewhere.\n\nThere are, of course, limits to the lengths law enforcement and school officials can go, and I believe that those lines need to be more sharply delineated. The Supreme Court has dealt with the privacy rights of minors in the public education system many times before, but questions involving the internet are relatively new and need to be worked through. An important Supreme Court ruling in the 1960's (the name of which escapes me) involving students wearing arm bands in protest of the Vietnam War commented to the effect that \"Students do not leave their rights at the schoolhouse gate.\" I think that a students use of any form of internet communication which could reasonably be considered private should be respected as such.\n\nPeace,\n#6\n\n",
        "First things first. President Bush is completely stepping over the line\nwhen he pushes for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.  His\nreasoning is at its base a religious reasoning.  Of all people the\npresident of the United States should not allow his faith to cloud his\njudgement, and yet that is exactly what he is doing.  There should be a\nseperation between the church and the government.  First of all,not all\ncitizens of the United States agree with his religious point of view.  How\ncan we base a law which will affect those very people to their core on one\nman's opinion?  I can see the point that some make that \"marriage\" is\nbetween a man and a woman.  Ok sure, but then leave the word marriage in a\nchurch and allow everyone to have a civil union.  This way everyone would\nbe able to recive benefits from their life partner whether they be\nheterosexual or homosexual.  Some of these same people however argue\nagainst even a civil union between same sex couples because these same sex\ncouples cannot have children.  Okay, if we're going to use that argument\nthen we cannot allow those couples who cannot have children or plan on not\nhaving children to have a marriage or a civil union either.  Whatever law\nis made it needs to apply to all people not just marginalize one group. \nTo me the law against civil unions against homosexual couples reminds of\nthe Jim Crow laws against blacks in the early part of their freedom.  How\nis this any different?  It is discrimination against a group of people\nsimply because of who they are.  They cannot change who they are and they\nshould not have to.  They should be accepted into our culture as part of\nit.  Which in fact they are.\n\n",
        "Gender discrimination will always exist, because people will always reference what has happened in the past. Even when someone satirizes gender discrimination (provide an extreme example to highlight the flaws in that way of thinking), they are still prolonging its life by reminding people how to discriminate.

Anyone can be subject to discrimination - everyone is different in their own way, and that can always be viewed in a negative light.\n",
        "    While gay marriage is a touchy political subject, I don't understand why some people are so opposed to it.  Their main argument against gay marriage is that it corrupts the American family unit.  To this, I say: Look at all the married couples who get divorced – the American family unit is far from perfect.  I think allowing two people of the same sex to marry would actually reduce rates.  This is because gay people currently have to endure so many hardships if they want to get married.  If they choose to get married, or seek marriage, they will have to face a lot of criticism from outside sources.  As a result, gay couples will be less likely to get married on a whim, as many straight couples undeniably do.\n    If people learn one thing during their time on earth, I think it should be that all people are different.  Homosexuality is not a \"life choice.\"  Gay people are simply attracted to the same sex.  True, they comprise the minority of the population when it comes to sexual orientation, but society should still accept homosexuality for what it is.\n    If gay marriage does become legal, who is it going to hurt.  You are going to see gay couples anywhere you go, so you can't escape reality.  Gays aren't out to take over the world, they simply want to have the same rights as heterosexuals.  To make them a separate class of individuals is cowrdly and childish.  It's the year 2006.  We need to accept people for who they are.\n    My uncle is gay, and he is just like everybody else (except his sexual orientation).  My take on the whole gay marriage situation is:  It's not that big of a deal.  If two people want to get married- let them.  End of story.\n",
        "Gay marriage is a tough topic.  I am still not really sure where I stand on this issue.  It does seem to me that marriage is an instituion that is designed for a man and a woman.  I have gone to Catholic school my entire life and it was pretty well engrained that homosexuality was something \"bad\".  I believe that the Church's official position on homosexuality is that while it is not wrong to have homosexual feelings, it is wrong to act on them.  In this regard, it would make sense that gay marriage should not be allowed.  However, I can not just go strictly by this point of view because as I have gotten older and have been able to think more for myself instead of just accepting what I am told, my views on homosexuality have broaded.  I am much more accepting now.  I have a couple of friends who are gay and I don't feel that I treat them any differently than any of my heterosexual friends.  However, being accepting of homosexuality and supporting gay marriage are  I think that whatever the decision, not exactly the same.  I am pretty  I think that whatever the decision, divided on this issue.  On the one hand, if a gay couple is in love and really wants to get married, who are we to tell them that they are not allowed to get married.  Maybe they want to adopt a child or start a family.  It would make sense then that they should be bound together by marriage and by law.  Also, marriage can often make things easier financially, such as when filing for taxes.  Why should we deny h I think that whatever the decision, omosexuals these benefits of marriage?  On the other hand, I most often think of marriage as a sacred bond between a man and a woman.  I still struggle to get past this idea. Regardless of what the decision is, I think that it is strange that is is legal in some states but not in others.  We are the UNITED states of America, and so it seems logical to me that we should be united on such major issues as gay marriage.   I'm not really sure how I feel about President Bush's push for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. It seems that right now, the situation is probably a happy medium because if a gay couple REALLY wants to get married, they can at least go to certain states.  However, the people who are really against gay marriage can be somewhat satisfied because at least gay marriage is not legal everywhere.  This is one of those issues where it is really hard to come up with a right or a wrong answer.\n\n",
        "To whom it may concern:\n\nI feel as though the school officials were not invading privacy at all. The entire point of a myspace bulletin is for people- the public- to see. Why anyone would post something as horrible as a potential school shooting on myspace is beyond me, and even more so if the person does not expect to be caught. The school was doing its job by looking out for all of its students. If anyone within the school system is in danger, someone needs to do something to fix it. The school needs to make sure that its environment is a 100% save place for kids to be. Did the school harm the person who was going to do the shooting? No. The school used myspace- since it IS available to the public- to TURN OVER the potential shooter. I don't see anything wrong with the school turning over a student who was willing to kill others. Where should we draw the line for privacy though? I'd say that the school should not go on the internet to  only get kids in trouble. If there are lives in danger, then the school/police should be able to use things such as myspace to get kids in trouble. However, if the school is only looking for pictures of kids drinking, etc., then I think that that is an invasion of privacy. What the school did was good, but if they did the same thing for other reasons (to catch kids drinking, etc.), then THAT would be \"taking it over the edge\" as an invasion of privacy.\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nID # 20\n\n",

One of my main issues with the church is that most of its rules\ncome from the Bible.  The Bible is a learning tool ,not a set of laws. \nNot only that, but the Bible was written by man, and man is prone to\nerror.  God did not write it.  Not only that but if there is a God would\nhe really denounce the fork?  At one point Catholics denounced the fork\nbecause it was a \"tool of the devil\".  Also the Bible was put together by\na man that did not become a christian until he was on his deathbed.  I\nunderstand that the Church has views of its own, but many of those views\nare horribly outdated. Women are no different from men in their ability to\nbe spiritual leaders.  We have women in positions of power in every other\nwalk of life, why not in the Catholic Church. Another bone to pick is\nabout priests.  The concept of celibate priests was not originally in the\nChurch.  It was a political ploy to gain the Church more money, because\nthe Churches priests were building were being handed down to their sons\nrather than the Church.   This is preposterous.

        "The war in Iraq has gone on long enough.  No one knows exactly what the US is meant to be doing by occupying Iraq.  The goals of our presence there are unclear to the American public, making it hard as a citizen to support the continuance of the war.  It is easy to see only the negative aspects of war, such as lost lives, the fragmentation of families, the distraction from domestic affairs, and the way in which the war has become the focus of American foreign policy.  With no clear goal in mind, it is difficult to distinguish anything positive that could result from American occupation of Iraq.  The negative effects of the war are already taking a toll on American society, and the longer we continue to stay in Iraq, the worse these effects will become.  More families will be torn apart, more soldiers will die, and more pressing issues will arise and be neglected due to the focus on the war in Iraq.  There is really no purpose to the continued occupation of Iraq.  Americans should realize that their country in doing no good to the Iraqi people by having troops there.  The citizens of Iraq as well as the American population, would fare better if the American government left the war in Iraq and returned to its fulfilling its many other roles.\n",

        "I am ashamed to say that I know very little about the situation with the war in Iraq.  I don't really follow politics that much and am not very in tune with what the current situation is.  My thoughts on this topic will have to relate more to the events of Septemeber 11th and how that lead to the war in Iraq.  After our nation was attacked, and we started the war in Afghanistan, I felt that that war was justified (or at least justified as much as you can justify war, which is a whole other issue). The facts were that we were attacked and we were waging war in Afghanistan in an effort to find the people responsbible for attacking us.  It would have been very strange for us NOT to have had some sort of a response to such a major attack.  However, it gets somewhat more tricky when we move to talking about the war in Afghanistan to the war in Iraq.  I will try to explain my views as best as possible.  After the events of September 11th, we were really on the watch about other possible terrorist attacks or attacks of any other kind on the United States.  So when ideas surfaced that Saddam Hussein might have biological weapons in Iraq, naturally our attention was aroused.  However, with the whole issue of Saddam not allowing United Nations officials to search Iraq, the issue became even trickier.  We were very nervous that Iraq was lying and the fact that they refused to let UN officials search made us even more suspicious.  So naturally,we wanted to find out for sure.  But we did not have permission from the UN to wage war.  I think that one of the points of an instituion like the United Nations is to prevent such situations from escalating into war. However (and I am a little unsure about the chain of events that took place here) I think that what happened was that time was starting to run out.  It was taking so long to gain approval from the UN and it began to look like we wouldn't get the approval after all.  Then, we were afraid that if there really were weapons of mass destruction that Iraq was hiding, we could be setting up our country for disaster if we did not do something about it.  So we have on our hands a very difficult decision.  I know that this is the point where many people bring up the issue of oil and say that Bush only wanted to go into Iraq to get oil.  But we ARE in Iraq now and have we really gotten oil out of the situation??  Anyway, think of what would have happened if we had NOT gone into Iraq, and then it turned out that Saddam had weapons that he then used on the United States.  Imagine if we had not done anything about it and had just sat back waiting to be attacked? Now, the situation over in Iraq is difficult as well.  By going in and removing whatever form of leadership and government existed, we have completely taken away any form of a political structure.  The citizens of Iraq were living under horrible conditions, so in many ways, we are making their lives better.  But now, it is a big mess over there.  I think that it is up to us, since we were the ones that went in an took out their political stucture, to stay there to finish out what we have started.  We started the mess by going into Iraq in the first place, so it is thus our responsibility to finish it and make sure that everything gets cleaned up. At the same time though, enough American lives have been lost already and I would hope to see more troops coming home and the United States finishing up its business in Iraq as soon as possible.\n\n",
        "I believe that war in Iraq has gone on for far too long.  A just cause for going to war would have been to aid another country in need of governmental assisstance.  If our true purpose, as the United States, was to help Iraq restore a Democratic government then the cause, in my eyes, was completely justified.  For whatever reason there are countries in the world that have fallen in to regimes that inflict a great deal of unjust power on their citizens and the regime, over time, has been enforeced and engrained in to the society so that it is very hard to break or even see that it is wrong anymore.  The United States was completey right in starting the war and helping to break down the tyranny so the citizens could experience a more liberating government.\n\nIf, however, the government chose to go to war in Iraq for more personal reasons dealing with President Bush's family history with Sadam Hussein, then it was completely unjustified.  There is no reason that an entire country should go to war and spend numerous resources for a cause that stems back to personal bad blood between two men.  There are far better uses to our country's resources than a war for unjust personal reasons.\n\nSince we have already gotten our point across that we wanted to spread democracy, I believe our retreat has been long since overdue.  The point has been made and we are now wasting precious resources on foreign soil.  We are having problems with our social security system, poverty, and many other things on our own soil, yet we are spending billions of dollars to fight a war that has lost any sort of meaning or purpose.  At some point the officials in Iraq need to take the reigns back and take the government over for themselves, and the sooner the better so they do not become dependent.\n\n",
        "First things first we have to make a decision.  Is anything put out onto\nthe world wide web truly private?  The Internet is a public domain, no one\nowns it, and so how can it be private.

        "   One of the most recent headlines involved he bipartisan Iraq Study Group, who recently published a report which emanded several things that go against Bush's agenda.  The report called for a definite timetable (15 months I believe) for the complete removal of American troops from Iraqi soil, as well as direct interaction with Iran and Syria.  Obviously, this group feels that the war has gone on long enough, and that it is time for the Iraqis to take the matters of their country into their own hands.\n    There should never have been a war.  President Bush invaded Iraq under false pretenses.  He claimed possession of proof that Saddam Hussein, the leader of Iraq, was in possesion of weapons of mass destruction.  However, no such weapons were ever discovered.  And what about the nations who actually admit to owmning nuclear weapons? Shouldn't we invade them too?  Well, the U.S. can't invade itself, but what about North Korea?  It seems to me that there was obviously much more behind this invasion.  Bush also made this war into a war against terrorism, playing on the angry emotions still left over from the terror attacks of September 11th, 2001.  But most of the terrorists came from Saudi Arabia and countries other than Iraq.  I think that oil and money were the reasons for the invasion of Iraq.\n   Bush also advocated the spread of democracy as a goal of this war.  If he knew his U.S. history, he should know that almost 100 years after the Revolutionary war, the United States was still fighting against itself.  Democracy takes time, and it takes even longer when it is forced upon people.\n So many American soldiers have died in Iraq.  No more should have to die.  But if the U.S. pulls out too soon, what did thousands of American soldiers die for?\n  I think that President Bush has demonstrated several errors in judgement  throughout his two terms.  In his military decisions and in his appointments of advisors he has chosen quite disasterously.  Therefore, I think it would be wise to follow the reccomendations of the Iraq Study Group.\n",
        "To whom it may concern-\n\nI definitely believe that gender discrimination exists in society today. It is everywhere from school, to a child's playhouse, to even the workplace. I'm pretty sure that there is always going to be at least a little bit of gender discrimination in this world. It seems as though it has been incorporated into our culture since the beginnings of time. Since men are naturally more muscular than women, they will always be perceived to be the stronger and more dominant sex. Women, by their regular caring nature, will always be looked upon in that motherly sense. Physically, our bodies are made this way. Women can care for infants by providing nutrients through breastfeeding, while the men \"take care\" of the family with their muscles and toughness. I don't think that there is anything\nanyone can do to totally eliminate the discrimination of different genders, but it can definitely be changed to a more equal state. I believe that, since society influences gender by producing things relating specifically to girls or boys (generally), there is only one way to get rid of gender discrimination. This way is to raise someone in a world not affected by society's views on gender. This, of course, will basically be next to impossible- but if you want to throw your child on an empty island for the entirety of his/her life, it may be possible.\n\nThis gender discrimination influenced by society is obviously part of the workplace, since the workplace makes up a good amount of society. I used to be employed by a real estate company, and I was a receptionist/secretary. This is not your typical job for an 18 year old male. My friends would joke around with the idea saying that I had a girly job, which I knew was true. (but hey, it paid good...) This job is definitely a girly job, and I can totally see that. There are more masculine jobs such as construction workers. These stereotypes go back to the physical nature of men vs. women, and how they are perceived. Construction needs muscles, and secretaries need...multitasking abilities??? ha ha. The point is that gender discrimination is DEFINITELY in the workplace, and throughout the world. This is not always a bad thing though- Is it hurting anybody? In these cases no, but that's not to say that it doesn't happen. This type of discrimination is part of human nature- something that we can not help.\n\nThanks for listening!\n\n-ID#: 20\n\n",

It is actually a bit scary if\nyou think about it, because now that society has become so digitalized\nwe are all leaving traces or ourselves or footprints out in cyberspace\nthat can be easily tracked by just about anyone.\n   One has to realize that anything that is done on a computer and put on\nthe internet is liable to be there forever in some form or another and\nis able to be looked at or viewed by almost anyone. That is why it is\ncalled the World Wide Web. It streaches accross contenents to\neverywere.\n   In regardes to other pricavy laws, such as the tapping of phone\nconversatinos and phone lines, i do not necissarily like this idea, but\ni do realize that it is for our protection. I dont really feel like I\nhave anything to really worry about, because honestly if some\ngovernmental agency were to listen in to my converstation randomly they\nwould be very dissappointed because most of my conversatinos are quite\nsilly and have not content about polotics or anything of that matter.\n   I like it that they are able to stop people from commiting crimes\nthough, just by listening to people talk. ON the other hand, this idea\nis very creepy. It is almost like that whole \"big brother\" \"father'\nthing of the story 1984 by George Orwell. Basically anything one does\nis monitored and I dont really like the idea of people listeing to my\nconversations to my mom or to friends. Yes I feel like it is an\ninvasion of privacy, and I wish it did not have to be done. I feel like\nit used to be that only if certain words poped up in a sentence, such\nas \"bomb, war, terrorist, presiden, etc.\"  then your conversation would\nbe monitored. I am not sure if that is how it quite works now.\n   FOr the patriot act, bacically it is just a freindly name to help\ndisguise what its true funcion is....to take away more or our privacy\nand freedoms, yet while I know this I am afraid to say that i am a bit\nrusty on what the details of this act are. I just know that it sounds\nfriendly and helpful and in reality it is not as nice as it seems.\n   When it comes to the safty of others though, going back to the school,\nI do not think that there really sould be any line drawn. The school\nshooter could have killed many lives, and with what just happened at VT\nlast year, I would be more then happy if any school shooters were\ncaught beforhand. THere are some rights that we should just accept as\ngiven, and some we should take as gifts but realize that people are\ngoing to monitor them to keep us safe. I feel that as long as this last\npart...to keep us safe....is kept in this strick regards, then we\nshould be fine, but we need to make sure that the government or school\nofficials do not go too power hungry.\n\n",
        "Privacy rights is a topic that is very difficult to discuss in that it is\nvery hard to draw a line as to what exactly constitutes private behavior\nand what constitutes public behavior.  Therefore, with the myspace\nexample, and with internet use in general, it is very hard to pick one\nside.  From what I understand about myspace, most everything a person\nposts is viewable by anybody who logs onto the service.  Actually, i'm not\nsure you even have to log on. I think you can just search for a person and\nview their information.  Which leads me to believe that was in fact, not\nan invasion of privacy at all.  It all has to do with intent.  To look at\nthe most basic form of privacy, the form innate to all humans, is the\nprivacy of our thoughts.  While uncountable thoughts run through our heads\neach day, we have the choice as to which thoughts we want to keep to\nourselves and which thoughts we want to vocalize, or make public, for\neveryone to hear. It is this choice, I believe, that determines whether or\nnot our actions are deemed as public or private.  If this student's intent\nwas for nobody to see the things he wrote, he should have posted somewhere\nwhere people couldn't see them, perhaps on his computer somewhere just in\na word document, or in a diary, or some other private form.  If he wanted\nseveral people to see what he wrote, but not certain other people, there\nare other options for doign this.  However, posting on myspace, where\nanyone who wants to read it can, is akin to running out in the middle of\nthe street, screaming that you want to kill people.\n\nEveryone has weird thoughts.  Everyone, I'm sure, has had at least for one\nmoment, thought about something that they would never ever want to share\nwith anyone. There's nothing wrong with that.  If you want to write it\ndown, go ahead and write it down somewhere.  But don't post it.  Don't let\nother people see it, unless you want them to.  But if you put yourself in\na situation where other people can freely see what you've written, without\nany devious means, then don't complain that they're invading your privacy,\nbecause it's your fault.\n",
        "Gender discrimination is still an issue in the present-day United States.  The reason that it is much more so a question these days is because it is not as readily apparent and the trend has been steadily decreasing.  ECONOMY/SOCIETY CRIMEDiscrimination based on gender existed for many centuries before modern day society and that type of culture and thinking is embedded in to the thinking of the people.  Such a change from complete discrimination to none at all could not occur over night.  I believe this is the problem that we still see today, a left-over from the thinkin of the past.  There has been a great deal more of awareness made about the issue and I believe the mindset with which children are raised is beginning to be a lot more enlightening and open to diversity so that such issues will work themselves out of the culture within generations.\n\nThe business world is one of the major areas where sexual discrimination has been historically embedded, and because of that some of the left-over discrimination still exists.  The stereotype of good business relies on linguistic and communicational styles that are found inherently in man because business came to be in a world where men conquered that aspect will women stayed at home taking care of the home and children.  Today businesses are beginning to shift this mindset so that they are open to women and other diverse groups in the workplace.  They are beginning to see how strong business characteristics are inherent in women, they simply do not show them or express them in a similar manner so that males do not readily pick up on them.\n\nCertainly men, just like any other group with a unifying characteristic, are discriminated against.  It would be hard to argue that any given group has never been discriminated against.  There are certain aspects of society that men are kept out of as well as women.  The only difference is that our political and business systems make up a majority of the public eye and this is where gender discrimination in favor of men has historically taken place.\n\n",
        "First, the shooter was dumb to post a myspace bulletin. I don't understand why people have these stupid personal pages and leave their lifes history for any random person to read about! THe kid must have wanted to get caught if he/she was silly enough to post a bulletin leading authorities to assume that he was going to bring a gun to school. I do not think this was an invasion of privacy by any means. Everything on the internet is open to the public. People post personal things to be read-they cannot pick and choose who they want to read it or not. At my high school, our principle had an account..it was well known..the administration would occasionally check up on what was going on in the school. I had no problem with it..if you feel like you have to hide something, then maybe you should not be doing it! Where to draw the line? Well, if it is for our safety and well being, then I don't think there needs to be a line. If kids express themselves through the internet rather then getting help, then authorities should have the rights to see these things. Sometimes people express themself better through writing-a troubled person could just be waiting for someone to hear them and help.I have nothing to hide that I post. If you want to hide something..do I have nothing to hide that I post. If you want to hide something..do not post it online. This will help with the whole drawing the line issue. We can allow authorities to keep an eye on troubled people not post it online. This will help with the whole drawing the line issue. We can allow authorities to keep an eye on troubled people\n",
        "\n\n   When it comes to gender discrimination, I do feel that it is still\npresent in socitey. It is something that has been going on from the\nvery begining of time, and I am not really sure if it will ever\ncompleatly go away.\n   When women finally got the vote here in the USA, it was after the\nAfrican Amaricans, wich is ironic being we had the whole civil war\ngoing on at one point trying to argue that they should be kept as\nslaves (wich we rightly judged that they should not, and i am glad of\nthis fact!) However, women, even though they were white were not\nallowed to vote until after the african american men could. Actually,\nwhite and african american women were lumped together in this case in\nthat neither were allowed to vote untin the 1920s at the same time.\n  With this bit of history, we have clearly come a long ways, yet there is\nstill many things that keep women down. There is the theory of the\n\"glass roof\" in some jobs, were women can only be premoted so high, and\nthen can never really get to the full top because the men in society or\neven the views of other women keep them down. It is getting to be a\nlittle more common to see women in the top positions, yet most CEO's or\nBosses are still the men.\n   I being a woman would like to think that I can rais up into the career\nof my choice as far as I would like to go without any bounderies. I\nwould like to feel and think that in these positions or in any position\nthat I might have or obtain, I would be respected just as much as a\nmale would. It is here that we come to our first problem.\n   Women are still often thought of as the parent that should stay at home\nand raise the children and shoule be under the rull of the man of the\nhouse. Or at least this used to be the majority of thinking.\n   Now a new type of gender discrimination I feel is starting to evolve,\nand it does not have to deal with women under men, but women against\nwomen. It is now starting to be that if you are a mom, it is not\nenough. You should not only rais a family, cook, and take care of them,\nbut you should also be involved in clubs, activities and have a part\ntime job. If you are not able to fullfill all of these requiremnets,\nsome women are looking down on those that dont and feel that because\nthey are they are better and more supirior. It is an odd concept, but\nture. I guess it is the balencing of a sacle really. As soon as women\nstart to gain acceptance into a male dominated society, other women\nstart to look down on you if you are not taking every opportunity that\none can. THis is not just in teh united states that i see this but\nstreaching accross the ocean to the UK as well.\n   Men are also discriminated against when it is the wife in the family \nwho seems to be the one who is earning the money. A father should be\nrespected for staying at home and taking care of his family if that is\nwhat they choose to do, yet ofthen stay at home fathers are looked down\nupon, wich is sad. ONe should not be judged for what they do if it is\nnobel, such as taking care of thier children and family.\n  Do I see any way of changing these prejucices? Unfortunaly not\novernight, but I feel only time will tell what happens next.\n\n",
        "I absolutely feel as though the catholic church needs to change its ways, not only to adapt to life in the 21st century but also to help cleanse its image that has been tarnished over the past decade or so from pedophilia accusations.  Women are as much a part of working America as men are and in many other religions women are perfectly capable of running a congregation as its spiritual leader.  If we are supposed to believe that all men and women have been created in the image of God then should all men... and women be able to teach the word of God.  The church needs to change it's ways now.  With a rather new Pope in office and ever changing landscape of the world we live in Priests should be allowed to marry and women should be allowed to preech.\n",

        "    The Catholic Church could certainly use some changes in the modern times we live in.  Allowing female priests and allowing priests to marry would certainly prevent any pedophilia from occurring amongst priests.  However, I think people in general give the Catholic Church a lot less credit than they really deserve. There are many good men out there who have chosen to be priests.  The media, in broadcasting so much about the pedophilia incidents and making it seem more widespread than it really was, hurt all of these innocent men. While the pedophilia was not as widespread as everyone thought, I am sure that some changes to the church will keep these incidents to a bare minimum.\n\n",
        "I don't think the Church is outdated to the point where people feel isolated from it, therefore I don't think it needs to be changed immediately.  However, if the members of the Church agree that some of the practices are becoming archaic and uneffective in modern day, then change would be appropriate.\nThe pedophilia scandal is a shame, but it's the priests fault.  The Church is made up of humans who aren't perfect, and sometimes downright evil in the case of the pedophiles. However, priests have managed to do OK for centuries without raping little boys, so these people have no excuse.\n",
        "The Catholic Church is very outdated in its extremely conservative views,\nand it needs to realize that if it wants to maintain a following, it needs to implement some changes in its doctrine.  We live in a world where anything goes, where we are taught tolerance and acceptance of others who may be different from ourselves in various respects.  The Catholic Church teaches to \"love thy neighbor as thyself\" but shuns homosexuals and non-Catholics, taking a very hypocritical stance.  Anyone who agrees with these views would be deemed intolerant by today's society, and since we are brought up learning the value of tolerance, this could be quite insulting.  Modern Catholics are put in a very difficult situation of choosing between their religious doctrine and the standards of society.  In order to fit in better with today's society, the Catholic church needs to relax some of its stringent rules to become more accepting and more appealing to a modern audience.  The accusation of pedophilia were probably unavoidable, but changes in the Catholic Church would still be a very beneficial thing.\n",
        "I attended a Loyola Alive meeting two weeks ago that facilitated a discussion about the movie \"The Cider House Rules\" and the topic of abortion.  The movie takes place during the 1940's, a time when abortion was illegal.  It became obvious that one of the points that the film-maker was trying to make had to do with the rules women were forced to obey, rules that were made by men who knew nothing about abortion.  The leader of the discussion asked us this question: \"What is so unique about the new Speaker of the House?\"  And the answer is of course, that Nancy Pelosi is the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives in the history of the United States.  And men still greatly outnumber women in both the House and the Senate.  There has never been a female President, or Vice President, or Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  Condaleezza Rice is only the 2nd female Secretary of State.\n\nIf the U.S. government, the most important and the most prominent institution in this country, is still dominated by men, then yes, gender discrimination against women is a very real problem that exists in our society.\n\nIn several career fields, such as engineering and the military, men also dominate.  My dad is an engineer, and he always comments about the lack of women in powerful positions.  He used to tell me it was a good thing that I didn't want to be an engineer, because it was very difficult for women to gain respect in the field.  Obviously the military is mostly made up of men.  Indeed there are many people who feel that women should never have been allowed to join the military at all, and many more who believe that women should never be part of a draft (if another one were to occur).\n\nEven in such a high-profile industry as the the sports business, women are discriminated against.  For example, female tennis players receive less prize money than male tennis players for the same Grand Slam tournaments.\n\nGender discrimination is not specific to women however.  Men experience it too.  Though they are more likely to encounter it in the educational system.  Studies have shown that the two sexes learn in different ways and respond better to different teaching methods.  Studies have also shown that teachers tend to cater to the learning needs of young girls and encourage them more than young boys.  Because it was the girls who were for so long at a disadvantage in the classroom, today teachers tend to (usually unconsciously) overcompensate.  It's not that they deliberately neglect the boys, but that they are trying so hard educate the girls well, and NOT ignore them.  Indeed the numbers of boys going on to higher education is dwindling. Here at Loyola College the student population is at least 60% female, and this is common in colleges throughout the country.  Boys have special education needs and they are not being met.\n\nSchool administrations need to keep a closer eye on their teachers and the classroom environment that they create.  They should educate teachers about the various methods of teaching.\n\nIn order to fight gender discrimination against women in the workplace, the government must enforce stricter regulation of hiring practices and harsher punishments.\n\nThe most important thing in the fight against gender discrimination is the recognition that it is still a very real issue in today's society.\n",
        "Marriage is a legal right that everyone in the country deserves to have.  If mentally challenged people with Down's syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome have the right to get married and have children, how on earth can we deny that same right to homosexual couples who are functioning members of society?  People say that gay marriage is against their religion – well their religion isn't the issue here.  Under the Constitution, they have the same right to practice that religion as they always have, and to deny the marriage of homosexuals within their own churches and institutions.  But states aren't trying to make priests perform marriages between two gay people - the only right on debate here is the right for two male or two female names to be on the same marriage certificate.  There is no way that if gay marriage is legalized, you'll walk into church one day and have to watch two men kiss at the altar.  This is in no way the issue, and what needs to happen is that people see that.  America has to look at this issue objectively, without the emotional reasoning that thinking about it in terms of religion brings.  Only then will we as a country come to see that we are denying people basic rights in the name of nothing more than personal belief.\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of gay marriage?  People say that homosexual couples threaten the validity of heterosexual marriage and somehow make it less special.  But homosexual and heterosexual couples are so fundamentally different, and yet so similar, that this will in no way happen.  Living with a partner of the same sex can't be the same as living with one of the opposite sex, yet they share the same feelings and roles in relationships, go through the same problems, and want the same things out of a marriage.  Some people look at homosexuals as simply promiscuous people who want sex all the time without the possibility of pregnancy or commitment.  From that standpoint, yes, homosexual marriage would make the institution of marriage look bad.  But in fact, this is a stereotype that is in no way true.  Homosexual couples have rates of commitment and break-up similar to heterosexual couples.  Many live their whole lives together, sharing every experience the same way a married man and woman do.  How could a committed couple make marriage look bad?\n\nThere is no way the federal government should be involved in this issue, unless the constitutionl amendment changes the definition of marriage to include the union between homosexual couples at all.  The separation of church and state should keep Bush from passing such an amendment, because other than a phrase written down over 100 years ago and some \"morals\" conferred on him by his religion, there is nothing behind his push.  Such an amendment would be a dangerous thing for the Republican party to pass, since the gay population is a growing minority who has a vested interest in the matter.  Besides, the federal government has a responsibility to protect the rights of those under it, not take them away.  Whose rights are protected by banning gay marriages?  The rights of heterosexual couples to be the only ones with a marriage certificate?  That seems like s snobbish kind of right to protect.  What about the rights of old ladies not to be offended by seeing a wedding performed between two men?  Well, we defended the right of old ladies not to see a black man and a white woman holding hands in public not so long ago.  That defense was known as the Jim Crow laws.  Is that really where we see ourselves at the beginning of 2007??\n\n",
        "To whom it may concern-\n\nI believe that gay \"marriages\" should not exist at all in the U.S. (or anywhere in general). With the occasional events where I am grossed out, I have no problem with gay men or women. I am a Roman Catholic, so it is technically against my religion to allow gay marriages. A marriage was created for a man and a woman to be united. Why doesn't the government create a different word for the union of two men or women? The \"union\" would not be valid within the Church, but there is no stopping the Church's opinion since the religion won't (and shouldn't) change. I feel that President Bush's \"push for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage\" is half good and half bad. The United States WAS created based on Christian principles whether people today like it or not. For this reason, President Bush is correct in following in our forefathers footsteps. Bush is wrong, however, for interfering with American's beliefs and lifestyles. In a way, it seems as though the government, based upon this legal action, is STARTING be become a totalitarian government, or whatever that is called. If the government could create an official \"union\" between two men or women, then I think that that plan would be sufficient to meet everyones needs. A marriage would remain sacred within the Church, and gay couples could legally be together. This plan would hopefully make everyone happy and get rid of all the controversy within our country on this topic today.\n\nThanks for your time....again.\n\nID # 20\n\n",
        "Marraige is a right that belongs to one person just as much as it belongs to the next.  Homosexuals and heterosexuals alike should be given the opportunity to marry whomever they choose.  Nowhere in the founding American  documents is it written that marraige is to be solely between a man and a woman.  The US government has no grounds for banning gay marraige.  Gay marraige should be accepted everywhere without question. A constitutional amendment banning gay marraige would be intolerant of heterosexual Americans and would be unfair treatment.  Such an amemdment would be outrageous and would likely be widely opposed.  The marraige of two individuals who are in love and choose to spend time with one another should not be the affair of any government.  Love is between two people and two people only, whether that be a man and woman or two people of the same gender.  In all cases, eveyone has the right to solidify their love for and committment to another individual through the binding act of marraige.\n\n",
        "No, I don't feel the Catholic Church needs to change if they don't want to.  I believe that the Catholic Church is its own institution and it can run how it wants.  Though, it would be nice to see some of these incidents of molestation drift away.  It is really up to the church for change though.\nAs of now, I think that the Catholic branch of Christianity is way to strict to allowcate any possible change.  It almost feels like the Catholic Church will end up like the Amish.  Strict ties to religion while ignoring society around it.  Though I don't feel that they absolutely NEED to change, as I'm fully content with people practicing what they believe in as much as they would like, I wouldn't mind seeing some kind of change.\n",

        "Dear CMCC Study,\n\nYes, of course gender discrimination is still and issue in the United states. It's derived from a mindset our culture has inherited from millenia of paternalistically structured Western societies.\n\nI believe that gender discrimination, at it's root, stems from ingrained cultural patterns, so any work to change it must begin at a very basic level. This means that it will take a long time to accomplish. I believe the work of feminist writers and theoreticians from throughout the 20th century have given us a good starting point, particularly those that deconstruct biased notions inherent in the linguistic norms of our language (the use of phrases like \"mankind\", or the preference for male pronouns when making general statements, for example). Basically, what I mean by this is that working against gender discrimination is a matter of changing attitudes, and that laws really only help on a superficial level.\n\nYes, women are still discriminated against in the workplace and in other places, as are men (though not as frequently). I think that the percentages of women in higher-level positions in the workforce and in politics is still very revealing. And not to sound like a conservative pundit, but there is such a thing as \"reverse discrimination\" as well. While it is rarer, occasionally qualified men do receive the short end of the stick when it comes to promotions and things of that nature because of \"politically correct\" considerations.\n\nPeace,\n#6\n",

Finally, I don't know if I can support a war where we can't see any end, but kids younger than me are dying.\n",
        "\nIn reference to this situation, invading the person's privacy is the\nproper action that the school took and I fully support them on that issue.\nBut soemtimes schools take it too far. At my old high school, which is a\ncatholic all girls institution, they expelled some girls because of\npictures they had on facebook. Granted the internet is a big free-for-all\nbut still I believed it was wrong of the school to do that. Now there are\nmany other issuses included in this particular one but the main fact is\nthat the school went online saw these pictures of the girls and expelled\nthem. Ok maybe i should explain a little more, the pictures were taken at\nthe high school, while the girls were in their uniform and the pictures\nwere of sexy girl on girl action. Now don't think pornography but either\nway it was girl on girl action. Is that still grounds for an expulsion,\nmaybe? But still the method in which they used to find these pictures is\nwhere I am finding the fault.\n\nSchools have to realize that the internet is a place where students can go\nto vent about their \"tragic teenage lives\" so they may say some things\nthat make the school systems wonder, the schools ultimately can not make\nany hasty decisions unless it was like our starting situation of the\nschool shooting. Schools should have a list of a criteria that warrant a\nsearch or immediate action, before engaging the students. But back to the\ninitial question of where should school officials draw the line ass to\nwhether or not they are invading privacy? Well my answer is safety and not\nreputation. Meaning my school may have expelled the girls because they\ndidn't want the reputation of a Catholic all girls high school that\npromoted lesbian actions .

        "Yes, I feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States.  While advancements have been made towards closing this gap, there still exists many places where we have not been doing too well.  While people are taught in elementary school that both boys and girls are equal and we should always be respectful, many children learn from observation. \nTheir father goes to the office everyday while their mother may either stay at home or hold some sort of part time job.  This teaches them, by observation, that men are the workers and women are the ones who take care of the family.\nIn order to make some kind of change, we have to continue on the same path that we have been.  That is, more and more women need to pull themselves out into the workplace and prove that they can do it too and defy aged boundries.  Also, both men and women need to learn to accept the change as a good thing rather than as a battle.  This only increases tension and increases the discrimination.\n",
        "\nI believe that every side is entitled to there owm opinoin on gay marraige\nbut that doesn't mean that they should limit the other side either. If you\ndon't like gay marriage thats fine but that doesn't mean that there are\npeople out there who aren't gay. Personally I believe that everyone should\nmind there own business, people are so concerned with what everyone else\nis doing that they are geting side-tracked. Especially the government,\nthey are so worried about who should marry who that they are not thinking\nabout more important things like the war in Iraq. I bet you that many of\nthe soldiers over there are alot more concernend about safely evacuating\nIraq than about if gay people should get married. Also I believe Bush is\ntrying to ban gay marriage because he is trying the stick to the\ntraditional foundation that has built this country. But slavery was a\nfoundation that built this country, and that is now illegal. Moreover my\npoint is that it shouldn't matter who we are allowed to marry, if there is\nlove in the relationship why should people who don't like it care? Because\nit looks weird and its different? Well alot of stuff looks weird and\ndifferent but that doesn't mean we should shun it. And further more aren't\nhomosexuals granted the right of a civil union, which is the same as a\nmarriage except for the benefits? Well if thats the case then they  should\nbe at least happy that they got that far and work toward geting the whole\nU.S. to give them that right. Because if you think about it there are ways\nto get all the benefits of marriage, its just alot of paperwork instead of\nautomatically getting it in marriage.\n\n",
        "How often do you see people challenging their gender roles?  Not often. \nPeople then ask innocently if gender discrimination exists today.  Of\ncourse it does!  It's all around us, and unfortunatly it goes both ways,\nboth women and men are discriminated against.  Many men who stay home with\ntheir children are seen as lesser because they are not the breadwinner for\ntheir family. This brings up another question, who says the man must be\nthe main earner for any family?  It is a socially mandated concept, and\nthese things can evolve and change.  Conversely a woman who has\nconcentrated on her career is often seen as cold and unloving as well as\ntoo driven.  A man who did the same thing would be commended for his\nambition.  The way things have been seperated in our society by gender is\nridiculous.  Why are these distinctions even present?  Men and women are\ndifferent yes, but with very few exceptions men and women can do the same\nthings.\nI am not saying that all of the restriction should be eased or even\nlifted.  For some it is necessary to be strict.  Tests for jobs such as\nthe police force or the firefighters should be the same for both genders. \nThis may mean there will be less of one gender but those who are there can\nactually do the job and do it well.\nGender discrimination is the same thing as any other sort of\ndiscrimination.  It is not any different to discriminate against someone\nfor their gender than it is to discriminate against someone because of\ntheir nationality or the color of their skin.  Things need to change, both\nin the workplace and in our society.  However I do not know how that can\nhappen until people admit that this is a problem.  Those who do not are\nkidding themselves.\n\n",
        "I think gender discrimination is very much still an issue in the US workplace, and will be for probably the rest of my lifetime.  There has been a lot of progress in this area though, aspecially recently as more and more women become well paid executives.  Women are discriminated against daily, and not just in pay.  The way they are treated by men in the workplace, especially their bosses, is discrimination by its very definition.  Many women are not treated equally, and not treated the same as men.  Whenever a man makes a comment about a woman's body, or a boss pinches a butt, that's discrimination.  It's demeaning for the woman, and in many cases can cause her to feel uncomfortable in the workplace and even have to change jobs.  The workplace should be an equal playing field for everyone, women shouldn't be made to feel inferior like that.  Noone should have to feel that their boss is coming on to them, and think \"Oh, maybe if I just sleep with him just once, he'll open a trapdoor in the glass ceiling.\"  That ceiling just shouldn't be there in the first place.\n\nPay is becoming much more equal in the salaried desk jobs where it was first raised as an issue.  Overall, women are hired much more often, which was the first big step.  Company regulations about pay and treatment are much stricter for fear of lawsuit.  Yet you still hear about the woman getting paid 75% of what a man doing her same job is getting, or the woman who enters an interview and leaves with \"I'm sorry, you're just not what we're looking for.\"  Eventually, the way things are going, this will hopefully disappear from society.\n\nMen are discriminated against in the workplace as well.  In traditionally female occupations like nurse or daycare provider, they may not only be teased by co-workers but by anyone they meet.  However, the discrimination against men does not usually include such aspects as pay discrimination or unwanted sexual attention, so it is not as serious.  I think it's rare for a man to leave his job because the workplace environment was made uncomfortable by excessive teasing.  This is also becoming less and less prevalent as men appear on TV doing traditionally female things – as hairstylists on Project Runway and What Not to Wear, as nurses on ER and Grey's Anatomy, and in many other roles.\n\nThe same thing is happening to women, as more and more women appear in positions of power in popular TV shows.  Like it or not, TV is a powerful influence on society today.  Trends are set through TV, and it teaches us social norms.  By seeing women running businesses on TV, men believe it is more acceptable when they see it done in real life.  This also means that younger generations will grow up accepting these things as normal.  As long as powerful women are portrayed in a positive light and respected on TV, the younger generation will fell that it is acceptable for a woman to have a higher paying job than her husband, and to even be a top CEO.  Women will be known for performing differently then men, but no better and no worse.  It will be seen as good to have the differing perspectives of men and women working together on one issue.\n\nParents need to help along this change in sentiment by talking about women in a positive light in front of their children.  Negative attitudes like \"That's not her place\" and \"She should be home with the kids\" are what will drag potentially successful women down.  Also, parents should encourage their female children to choose challenging professions, and to educate them about the variety of possibilities open to them.  When all of these things come about, discrimination will truly no longer be an issue in the workplace.\n\n",
        "I definitely feel as though the war in Iraq has gone on long enough. What began as a war on terrorism has turned into pointless killing of our troops. No progress at all has been made in Iraq, and once Sadaam was out of the country, there was really no other justifiable reason to remain. It is obvious by the way the Iraqis are treating our troops that they no longer want us in their country and I think it is time Bush admit defeat and bring them home. He has lost so much respect and support by keeping our troops there and the best thing to do is to let them return to their families and for us to go about our own business instead of medling in the business of others. We have our own problems to fix here at home so there is no sense in trying to fix the problems of another country, especially one that does not want our help. We have wasted billions and billions of our tax dollars on a pointless war and it is about time we accept defeat and bring everyone home. We are doing no good there and people are dying for a lost cause. We are making about as much progress here as we did in Vietnam and the Gulf War. Just think of the lives we could have saved if Bush had made better decisions and knew when to cut his losses.\n",
        "The argument dealing with privacy issues bears down on two fundamental topics:  the medium of communication and the content of the communication. In this case the medium, myspace, was a publically accessible website and the content was life-threatening.  With such a combination it is very hard to create an argument supporting privacy rights for thsi situation.\n\nIf the medium for this communication had been through a private phone line or an e-mail, that part of the argument would have been much more controversial and easier to offend for privacy issues.  If people intend their message to only reach one or a selected other number of individuals such as in a phone conversation or e-mail, then they have a degree of right to privacy.  If, however, they post their message on the world wide web on a site that billions of people have easy access to, then they are only ignorant if they believe they have any sort of privacy rights.  Their message is easily viewable and it is completey their responsibility because they made it viewable to the general public.\n\nIf the content of the information has to do with a prank or plans to hang out with friends on a Friday evening, then privacy right are certainly being broken.  If the purpose of seeking out this information is of such an informal purpose as one of the examples aforementioned, then privacy has been broken.  We, as a society, need to find some sort of boundary between simply prying in to others' lives and actually seeking out useful and pertinent information.  Since the information in the case had to deal with human safety and a threat to other lives, it was certainly pertinent information to seek out.  The society and its laws has been put in to place in order to protect its citizens, and certainly privacy laws are no different.  So privacy laws must be defined on these two principles of medium and content where if the medium is not intended to be private and the content is absolutely pertinent to the safety of human beings, then the law would support that pursuit by law officials.\n\n",
        "To whom it may concern:\n\nI think that the Catholic Church does not need to change its ways to adapt with the 21st century. What is the point in changing a religion to suit one's personal wants? I don't think that there is any logic in that. Everyone within the church most likely does not believe EVERYTHING that the Church stands for. I know many people who are religious, but support gay marriages, etc. Why can't people just be like them? I don't think that a religion would be where it is at if people kept changing it to suit how THEY WANTED to live. Religion guides the ways people should live...People should not guide the form of their religion. I personally am not the \"Jesus Freak,\" but I do go to church just about every Sunday. I don't know all about the Catholic religion, but I think that everything within it is there for a reason. The issue with women becoming priests makes me wonder a lot. \"Why shouldn't they become priests?\" people ask a lot. I say, \"why SHOULD they.\" The Catholic Church is known to be traditionally conservative, so why should they change that? It has always been that males could become priests and women could become nuns. A nun and a priest are basically on the same \"playing field\" in my opinion, so one is not better than the other. It's just like two different jobs within the same company with different specifications for their job descriptions. Each \"job\" is working towards the same general goal, but each title does different things.\n\nTo change the subject, I think that the charges against the Catholic Church are nonsense. That \"stuff\" goes on every day in other religions, organizations, etc. If the Church would change to fit the wants of the 21st century, it could be a good and bad thing. Yes it is true that, statistically speaking, the numbers of pedophilia would probably go down, but the attention would be taken off of the cases that occur anyways. All of the media's attention would go to the fact that the Church is changing. This would be bigger than if a priest did something gross with an juvenile. People just want what will get their attention most- they could probably care less about what a priest does in his spare time. So if the Church would change, everything that is on the news today (women not becoming priests, pedophilia, etc.) would not matter to anyone. Everyone would focus on this \"new change.\" People like to blame other people, it's in our nature- All in all, I would never consider changing the Catholic Church, because the accusations against it are not even as important to people as it may seem.\n\nVery long, but thanks for your time,\n\n-#20\n\n",
        "Good question.  I absolutely do feel that women are discriminated against\nin America.  In the workplace, at home, everywhere.  Here's the kicker\nthough.  Do I think this is a problem.  Nah.\n\nHere's the funny thing about discrimination.  What the word really means\nis the ability to make distinctions, or discernment.  And here's the\nthing, if America is headed in the direction where we can't discern the\ndifference between a male and female, then we are headed towards disaster.\n\nNow I'm not saying women don't have a place in this world.  I love women. \nThey are very useful for many different things.  Really, if there weren't\nany women, not only would our species come to an end, but I in particular\nwould be a mess.  You see, I can't really cook at all, and I don't\nparticularly like cleaning either.  I mean, I can clean, if something is\nreally grossing me out, and I could probably learn to cook too, but I\nreally just don't want to.  You may say, well Tyler, why don't you just\norder out, and hire a maid service?  Well, I'd say, ordering out does get\npretty pricey, and also I don't want cleaning people in my house that I\ndon't know.  They're a sneaky people.  They'd rob me blind.  So that's out\nof the question.  So really, unless I want to live with a very feminine\nmale roommate for the rest of my life, getting married is really the best\noption.\n\nI see that part of the question asks about discrimination in the\nworkplace.  I don't really know what that's all about.  I don't see what\nwomen need to work for.  That's what I do.  Plus there are plenty of jobs\nthat definitely need women to work: strippers, porn stars, supermodels,\nactresses, masseuses.  That's all I can think of right now.  I definitely\ndon't want these jobs to be male specific.  Especially not stripper or\nmasseuse.  I don't want any guys dancing on poles or rubbing my back.\n\nSo do I really feel this way, or am I being facetious?  I'll let you decide.\n",
        "No, this was not an invasion of privacy.  The internet is a public domain and anything that is put on the internet is accessable to many people.  The fact that the message was in the form of a bulletin is also another give away that it was meant to be seen.  By posting information like that in a bulletin rather than a message of some sort, they were destined to get some kind of negative reaction.\nI feel that it is an invasion of privacy when they take a small hint that someone might be plotting something, maybe by saying \"I hate my school\" or something, and digging deeper into it.  They progress to ordering searches of that student all because of one very ambiguous statement.  While preventing school shootings is a necessity, they need to be able to have some key factors that draw the line between an angsty stressed student and an actual murder hungry savage.\n",
        "   While I do feel that war should only be utilized if all other methods fail, I also feel that it is a necessary part of the world.  The war in Iraq was fought for a purpose - to remove Saddam Hussein from power.  It was quite apparent to everyone that Saddam was not a friend of the free world.  To me, it does not matter if we went to war over weapons of mass destruction that weren't there.  The U.S. saw a threat and dealt with it.  And now the world is a safer place because of it.\n    I cannot stand when people use hindsight to justify their arguments.  People who oppose the war in Iraq say that the president was lying to the American people about the WMD's.  In the business of intelligence gathering, not all intelligence is accurate.  Based on the intelligence the U.S. had at the time, we decided the probability of Saddam possessing WMD's was too high  not to take action. \n    I realize that war is costly in terms of soldiers' lives and money.  But teh bottom line is that the war in Iraq was necessary, if not now, then ten years into the future.  I applaud George Bush for having the courage to make an unpopular, but courageous decision.\n",
        "Alright, the War on Iraq.  I sure was against this war when we went in. \nWhat was that, 6 years ago?  Were we ever actually at war? I don't even\nremember ever declaring it at all.  I think we just hopped in there.  I\nsure was spitfire against this war when we went in 6 years ago.  I was\nextremely anti-Bush and definitely was a bleeding heart liberal.  Am I\nstill the same person I was six years ago?  Not at all.  Do I still think\nthe war was a dumb idea and that Bush is a dumbass?  Absolutely.  Do I\ncare anymore?  Not really.  Why?  Because my opinion doesn't really matter\nat all.  If I've learned anything over the Bush administration, it's that\npolitics isn't about issues.  It's about power.  It's about always being\nright, no matter if you know you're wrong.  It's about satisfying all the\ntypes of people who are lobbying to keep you in power.  It's really just a\npopularity contest now.  The real battle isn't in Iraq, it's on the\nhomefront.  Everyone join a side, republicans vs democrats!  Your opinions\ndon't really matter, just join a side so that side can beat the other one!\n The war in Iraq isn't about anything that we originally went in there\nfor.  Really, I'm not going to go into the different reasons why we went\nin, just go ahead and pick one.  Because it doesn't matter.  Right now, we\njust have an obstinate government who refuses to admit that they were\nwrong.  They are just stubborn jerks who have completely made a mess of\neverything they have touched over the last 8 years and they have to hold\nonto this.  And what next, Iran?  Syria? Maybe Afghanistan again, we\nforgot about them.  Maybe Bin Laden is still there!  Maybe we should\ninvade ourselves! Because hey, if you look at us seriousely, we are the\nmost dangerous country.  And we are dangerous to ourselves and to everyone\nelse who might look at Bush funny.  So lets just invade ourselves and get\nit over with before we do something like destroy some random country like\nIraq. Oops.  Too late.\n\n",
        "\n    The war in Iraq is a very tricky topic to say the least. I myself\nbelieve that we should get out of there because we are just loosing\ntons of soldiers. I understand that the entire reason why we entered\ninto the war was because of the attack of September 11th, but honestly\nas we have found out more and more it just does not make sences to\nkeep on fighting.\n   Originally we thought that the terrorists that attacked us were linked\nto osama bin laden, but as we later found out, that was not the case.\nInstead our president George W. Bush just used the escuse of the attack\nto go in and capture him. Well, we have done that and in the mean while\nwe have totally pissed off many of the terrorists groups such as the\ntalliban, and we have left Iraq in shambles.\n   IN a way i am glad that osama bin laden is off the market, though this\ncould have happened a lot sooner if Bill Clinten acted when he had the\nchance too, and then perhaps we would not even have been in this much\nof a mess as we are in right now. Yet I am not entirly sure why we are\nstill in Iraq. Well no, I take that back.\n   I do know that we are there because we got rid of their main\ngovernmental system, and that we have been working with them to have\nthem make their own governmental system, but it is taking an extreemly\nlong time. THe tricky part is that we can not leave too soon otherwise\nit would be like the catastrophy of when Russia invaded Afganistan.\nThey invaded a while back and then pulled out too soon and more\ncorruption just ivolved instead of any good coming of it, so I know\nthat is why we can not pull out right away from Iraq. However, I feel\nlike they are very much on thier way to running themselves. I do not\nreally understand why we have to keep sending more and more soldiers\nover there when they are trying to become more self suficient.\nWouldn't our sending troups over there send the message that we do not\ntrust them?\n   Perhaps it has to do with how long particular soldiers are allowed to\nbe out and on missions. I know that after a few months they are\nrequired to come home, so perhaps it just sounds like we are sending\nmore troups over there when in fact they are jsut replacing those that\nare coming home.\n   IN any regards, I don't like the fact that we are over there now, but\nunderstand why we can't pull out all of a sudden. I just wish that\nthere somehow was a faster way that we could get ourselves out of this\nmess, and unfortunatly I dont think that there ever will be, because\nterrorists seem to be like the idea of evoking fear into every nation\n(not just ours).\n\n\n",
        "I do feel as though gender discrimmination is still present in today's society. Although women have come a long ways in regards to equality and having the same opportunities as men, there is still that underlying sense of inferiority. I feel that gender discrimmination is more a problem in society's way of thinking because it shouldn't be a law that women be treated equally, it should just be that they are equal. Unless people change they this way of thinking all together, gender discrimmination will never go away. I find that when hanging out with my guy friends they will say jokes and comments in regards to women being inferior and although they just do it for a laugh, such jokes and comments show that there is still that underlying belief that has been present in society in regards to the status of women. Men should see women as equals because they want to not because they have to. I still feel as though if a man and a woman are going up for the same job position and are equally qualified, the man will get the job over the woman soley based on his gender. Also, women get less respect in the work place and we still see cases of sexual harrassment by co-workers. If men and women were really seen as equal, this problem would not still exist. Also, women who hold high positions in jobs are not always given the respect they deserve or the respect a man in the same position would get. During my senior year in high school and the summer before I left for college i worked as a nhas since its creation, and considering how far society as a whole has come,ight time receptionist and the daytime receptionist was a man. I found that one of the men I worked with was very condescending towards me and treated me in a way that he would never treat the daytime receptionist, and it probably had something to do with my gender.\n\n\n",
        "I do feel that the Catholic Church needs to change some of its ways to adapt to life in the 21st century.  Most of the \"rules\" that are stated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church were created years and years ago.  Many of them are now outdated.  Times have changed and things are not as they used to be.  Also, mostly the rules that were set forth were created by church officials.  They are not these all-powerful laws commanded by God; they were created by a political institution.  For the church not to change simply means that it is losing more followers. In today's world, it is difficult to follow strictly to every single rule set forth by the Catholic Church.  I feel that many people thus adopt an \"all or nothing\" approach:  if they don't feel that they will be able to stictly adhere to every rule, they will just not be a part of the Church.  This is really harmful to the Church.  Today's young people are growing up earlier than the youth of past generations.  That means that they face issues such as whether or not to engage in premarital sex, etc, at an earlier age than past generations.  These issues thus become more prevalent. I have gone to Catholic school my entire life.  I know MANY people who are baptized Catholic, but I know\nvery few people my age who truly believe in everything that the Catholic Church believes in.  With such highly debated issues as abortion, stem cell research and the use of contraceptives, there are more and more ways for people to have differing opinions.  People don't want to just be forced to accept and believe a certain philosophy because \"that's what the Church says\".  I think that by the Church not relaxing its views at least somewhat, it is losing touch with today's youth.  This is not to say however, that the Church should just forget about everything that it stands for.  We still need to promote morality, but some of the \"rules\" of the church are much harder to abide by in today's world than, say, a century ago.  We must remember that a just few centuries ago, the Catholic Church was a major political instituion in Europe.  So, many of the laws that were set forth were put in place by political officials who were interested in furthering the Church's political motives, not necessarily in enriching the lives of believers.  The Church has seen many corrupt leaders, and we should not be forced to still abide by laws that were put into effect by people who had only money in mind. As for the issue of pedophilia by priests of today, I do think that some of this could have been prevented had the Church relaxed some of its laws regarding entry into the priesthood.  For example, many of the men who were accused of pedophilia are around the age where they entered the priesthood a couple of decades ago.  Even since then, the times have changed and it has become more socially acceptable for people to be open about their homosexuality.  But back when these men entered the priesthood, even if they  knew that they were gay, it was not really socially acceptable for them to make this announcement.  But they would not want to get married to a woman, because were homosexual. So, since it would be somewhat strange for a man to not get married, man of these gay men saw the Church as a safe haven.  It was a place where they could live with other men.  I am not saying that all priests are gay, but I do believe that a good number of them are.  I am also not saying that all priests or all gay priests will thus become pedophiles, but I think that many of the men, as a result of their positions as priests, were put into situations which would be very tempting to them. I think that priests should be allowed to marry.  Yes, I know that an argument given by the Church is that Jesus was not married, so priests should not marry either, but there is new evidence coming out that it actually is possible that Jesus was married.  Regardless of whether or not this is true, however, I still think that priests should be able to marry. If priests were married, they would be able to better relate to a good part of the congregation.  Also, the numbers are decreasing of the number of men entering the priesthood, and I think that an excellent way to bring these numbers back up would be to allow priests to marry.\n",

        "Ok \nLets see \nGay marriage \nI know last week I remember reading in the paper that New Jersey \nUh the New Jersey Supreme Court \nUm \nLegalized \nWell gave equal rights to gay couples \nThe same rights as heterosexual couples although they left \nThey left the what to call it \nThe name to uh \nTo the legislator cause they didn’t \nWhether to call it a civil union or an actual marriage \nI know Massachusetts \nUm \nThey allow gay marriage \nThey call it marriage and I think in Vermont its called civil union \nSo its \nSo I think those are the only states \nSo there \nSo there obviously in the minority for allowing \nAh gay couples to have the same rights as heterosexual couples \n\nUm \nI myself am not against  \nUm \nPeople being gay and I think that \nThat gay couples should have \nHave the same rights as heterosexual couples \nThey should be able to adopt children and be given health benefits and all \nAll the rights that are \nThat are um \nHeterosexual couples are entitled to \nUm \nAnd I guess \nI guess I’m not quite sure whether that should be called marriage \n\nI know that’s a big issue \nI know there were \nThere’s been talk about an amendment to ban gay marriage and things like that \n\nWhich \nUm \nI’m not sure I haven’t quite made up my mind about that yet \nBut I’m definitely in favor of civil unions at least because they should have the same rights because its \nIts \nI mean often gay couples function better then \nThen ah \nRegular heterosexual marriages and \n\nAnd um \nSo I think that \nI think that New Jersey and Vermont have the right idea \nUm \nAnd then I guess there’s also a question of whether its \nIts going back to the amendment whether it’s something that should be decided by the national government or should \nKeep developing in each individual state \nAnd um \nI’m not really sure about that either \n\nUm \nI don’t think that there should be a a ban on gay marriage and right now I think that the way its going state by state is fine \nI think that’s a \nThat’s a good way to deal with it right now \nI think that the federal government has too many other things that they need to worry about \nUm \nRather then this issue \nSo \nBut I would be against at ban on gay marriage \n\nUm \nLet’s see \nIs there anything else \n\nUm \n(pause) \nI just \nI just think that it \nThat um \nIts \nYou know it’s a life style that many people \nUm \nAre adopting today and that when you \nWhen gay couples don’t have the same rights as as heterosexual couples there \nThere’s a lot of \nThere can be a lot of problems as a result \nLegal problems and things like that or \nUm \nAnd \nAnd so I just think that they should be given the same rights and privileges as \n\nAs heterosexual couples \n\nI mean \nThe marriage statistics in the country \nI think less then 50% of \nErr well \nI think more then 50% of marriages end in divorce in this country now \nAnd um \nSo \nUm \nSo its not \nIt’s not even like marriage is such a sacred thing any more \nIt doesn’t seem like to many people so I wonder why there’s such a great concern or \nUm \nOr a great support around not allowing \nUm \nMarriage between two gay people when it seems that the majority of the country doesn’t really care for or respect the institution much anymore anyway \nI think that’s interesting \n\nOh \nUm \nWell let’s see \nThere um \nOh New Jersey um \nBecause they’re allowing equal rights which is the most important thing and whether \nWhether \nWhat to call it isn’t as much an issue I think it’s more a matter of principle for people and \nIn um \nIn Massachusetts they \nIt’s actual just defined as marriage \nUm \nWhich I’m \nI actual don’t think I have a problem with that and um \nWell in Vermont to it’s a \nIts civil unions \nSo um \nI think ah \nThat \nI think that I’m in support of that \n\nYeah \n\nUm \nI think that’s it \n\n",

know \nIf it doesn’t suit somebody’s needs or personal wants then they’re not gonna take it \nAnd \nThey’re just gonna alter it \nAnd \nI personally think that that’s wrong \nUm \nYou know \nIt

follow that \n\nUm \nOr \nLike \nYou know \nFollowing the law \nI know a lot of kids who have said drinking is not \nYou know \nBad at all \nBut \nThen I have the other kids that say \nUm \nWell you know \nThe bible says to \nUh \nObey your law \nSo \nIn a lot of cases kids \nIt all comes down to interpretation I guess \nUm \nBut \nOn the other hand \nUm \nYou know \nWhen it does come down \nI don’t even know what the heck I’m saying \n\nUm \nLet me see here \nLike I said it is a lot easier when you’re writing \nBecause \nYou know \nYou’re not on the spot \n\nSo \nI guess that would help

believe um \nSome of them yeah would have been prevented \nUm \nBut \nI don’t feel as though the Catholic Church should change at all \nUm \nYou know \nThat \nIt’s not the Catholic Church’s fault that \nYou know \nThose people do that \nThose are just certain people \nYou know \nLike \nUm \nPeople like that are in any group nowadays \nLike \nYou know \nAnd \nThe media loves to pick on the Catholic

\nI guess like his conservative ways are good \nUm \nAnd \nAlso bad \nSometimes they’re a little too conservative \nUm \nBut \nOn the other hand he is sticking true to the religion \nUm \nAnd \nTherefore \nYou know \nLike I feel as though that’s right \nUm \nSometimes it’s a little too strict \nBut \nUm \nLike I said before I don’t feel as though religion should change for anything \nUm \nBut \nIt does come down to interpretation a lot \nBecause \nUm \nFor instance Benedict \nLike for Harry Potter or something like that \nThat’s a huge thing nowadays in our society \n\nUm \nHe was kind of against that \nAnd \nI feel as though that was a very strict interpretation of the religion \nA little too strict \n\nNot that I’m saying that \nYou know \nI mean \nAnd \nIf you allow that it’s not like it would be changing the religion \nSo \nI guess \nYou know \nUm \nYou could be \nYou could um \nYou could accept things nowadays through the religion \nUm \nBut \nYou know \nYou don’t

        "I would say yes \n\nUm \nI think that \nUm \nA lot of \nAlright actually I’m gonna back up \nUm \nThe Catholic Church was and still is a political institution \nI mean it was much more political institution back like when it was first founded \n\nUm \nAnd I mean people in politics are corrupt and there were a lot of like the rules or \nUm \nLaws that were made had to do more with the politics of like Europe at the time then actually having to deal with say what God wants us to be doing \n\nSo I think that some of the rules that were made or like things that are part of like the catechism aren’t necessarily \nUm \nApplicable to today’s world and even when they were made it was \nIt wasn’t necessarily that \nYou know \nIf you don’t follow these laws you’re offending God \nIt was partly just so the political institution of the church could stay in power \n\nUm \nSo I think that by \nBy not changing anything and you know by sticking with these rules that were made a couple hundred years ago or maybe even more \nI think that the Catholic Church is loosing a lot of it’s its members because \nI mean things have changed in the past couple hundred years so I think it’s a lot harder to live by like the rules that are set forth in the catechism so \nI \nI think that it’s a problem that they’re not changing anything because \nOk \nYeah there was Vatican 2 and that \nYou know now we don’t have mass in Latin and that changed certain things but I think there needs to be another reevaluation because I \nI consider myself a Catholic and I try to follow \nYou know \nAs much as I can but some of the things I just think are a little bit \nUm \nA little too strict in terms of what you’re actually facing \nDaily life in the 21st century opposed to when these laws if you wanna call them were written \n\nUm \nI mean in terms of like premarital sex \nIn terms of you know contraceptives \nIn terms of \nUm \nWhether or not \nUm \nLike priests should be married \nI think that they’re \nLike they’re loosing followers \n\nUm \nSo \nI \nI think that people especially like \nUm \nI \nI kind of noticed here like were at a Catholic school but most people don’t go to church \n\nUm \nAnd it’s just \nChildren are Baptized Catholic and maybe raised Catholic but they don’t actually like \nNot that many people in \nThat I’ve come across actually believe all that much \n\nUm \nAnd I think that it’s almost seen as like an all or nothing like if you can’t abide by all the rules then there just like oh well then the Catholic Church isn’t for me and they’ll just go and figure that \nYou know \nThey won’t be Catholic \nThey don’t believe any of the rules and I think that if some of the like the strict ideas were loosened a little bit to adapt more to what’s actually happening in today’s world that there might be more followers \n\nHm \nUm \nI think that \nUm \nI don’t know if that would actually like have changed but I could say that I think is that if \nLike \nThe priests that are \nYou know \nWere accused of pedophilia \nYou know \nThe age that that they like when they actually became priests \nLike speaking generally here \n\nUm \nThat was \nI mean things have changed since then and I think even since then it’s become more acceptable for \nUm \nYou know \nSomeone to come out and say that they’re gay so I think that it was almost seen \nLike that’s kinda why you have the stereotype that a lot of priests are gay because it was \nIf they weren’t going to get married it would seem strange for them to just be like a single male and so if they \nThey just \nSome of them \nObviously this isn’t everyone but some of them just went into the priesthood and wanted to act of their like their sexual feelings and they \nYou know took it out with these children but \nUm \nI think that if \nI don’t know if it would have changed any of that but maybe there wouldn’t have been as \nUm \nIf there were allowed to be \nIf priests were allowed to be married then \nUm \nI think it \nYou wouldn’t have the typical like stereotype of a lot of priests being gay because it wouldn’t be like an alternative like get married or be a priest \n\nSo \n\nUm \nMaybe about \nYou mentioned something about um female priests \n\nUm \nI’m not sure how I feel about that I guess I think that \nI mean \nJesus was a male and um I see that \nAnd you do have nuns so its not like women have no role \n\nUm \nI would say it doesn’t really bother me that women can’t be priests \nI \nI mean I wouldn’t want to be a priest \nUm \nI don’t know it doesn’t \nIt seems like the women can still play a role if they want to go into the religious life \nThey can still be a nun \nUm \nIt’s not like they’re not given any role \nSo \n\nUm \nI think that’s it

        "Hm \nLets see \nAt first we would have to examine \nThe teachings of the Catholic Church today and there doctrines and things like that so \nThen how that could possibly be in contrast with things that are going on in the 21st century \n\nUm \nSo \nI guess probably one of the things that a lot of people find problem with in the Catholic Church teachings is their strong position against abortion \n\nAnd \nThere’s a lot of debate about that today \nWomen’s \nA women’s right to choose or not to have a child and \nAnd \nAnd under what circumstances \nAnd \nAnd when is \nWhen is \nWhen does life begin \nAnd so the Catholic Church says that life begins at conception \n\nAnd \nA lot of people disagree with that \nUm \nI personally believe \nWell I’m personally against abortion \nUm \nAnd \nI mean so I think the Catholic Church is right on that because I don’t think that \nAnyone has a right to \nTo decide who lives and who dies \n\nSo \nSo I \nSo I’m against abortion so I agree with the Catholic Church in that and then a lot \nAnd then \nI mean \nMost people who do get abortions its \nIt’s usually \nIt’s either a form of \nOf birth control or its \nUm \nOr its \nIts an \nAnd then sometimes people may say well it’s under \nWhat about under extreme circumstances \n\nLike someone whose raped or something like that and that’s a terrible thing but I still don’t believe that we have the right to decide who lives and who dies and \nUm \nUm \nI think that \nWell the national government \nUm \nTook a \nTook a stand against partial birth abortion when they passed the partial birth abortion ban \nAnd so \nSo I think a lot of people \nUm \nHave feelings against \nAgainst uh \nAbortion or at least at that stage \n\nAnd so \nSo in the area of abortion I don’t think \nI think that \nI would have to agree with the Catholic Church and then \nUm \nThe \nChurch’s also against the death penalty \n\nAnd I would have to agree with that to \nI think the United States is \nWould actually be the country kind of going against the trend of the 21st century in that most other countries there is no death penalty and that’s pretty much something that you can find anywhere in \nYou know \nSay the Middle Ages or something like that but it’s pretty much been phased out of \nOf most of the world’s \nIn the 21st century and yet the United States \nUh still employs the death penalty and the way the Catholic Church looks at it is its \nOnce again its \nWe \nWe don’t have the right to decide who lives and who dies but also its \nThe \nThey system by which the death penalty is um \nIs um \nEmployed its \nIt’s a system of discrimination and it just goes against everyone’s human rights \nI mean \nMore then half of the people who were put to death \nUm \nAre minorities and \nAnd poor people who \nWho don’t have the money the means to \nTo hire good lawyers \nTo afford appeal after appeal after appeal \nUm \nAnd its \nAnd it’s not a just system either because after people have been put to death evidences \nNew evidence comes to light that these people really didn’t commit these crimes \n\nAnd so I just think that the chance that \nThat you could be putting to death someone whose completely innocent that \nJust terrifies me and that’s just absolutely wrong I think \nSo \nUm \nSo I’m \nSo I would agree with the Catholic Church in their \nIn their position against the death penalty and I think in that case the country of the United States is going against trends in the 21st century \nUm \nNow lets see \nThe Catholic Church also \nThey do not allow women to become priests \n\nAnd \nThat I don’t think I agree with because \nUm \nIn in the world and now we’re in the 21st century and women have been taking on greater roles in society and are working towards becoming \nUm \nAchieving equality and \nAnd so they should have the same rights as men and be able to do the same things as men \nAnd \nOne would think that the Catholic Church because it’s in \nIn such a great need of \nOf priests \nYeah I think if they \nI think if they opened it up to \nTo women \nThey would get a lot more of them \nI mean that’s what I hear almost at every masses \nUm \nIntentions for \nUm \nThe recognition of vocations to the priesthood or religious life and things like that \n\nUm \nAnd \nYou know I think eh \nAnd its there are plenty of examples in other religious denominations of \nOf women having important roles \nLeadership roles in just just another Christian denominations there are female um \nReverends and \nAnd things like that \nAnd \nSo I’m not exactly sure why the Catholic Church is so staunch in its position to exclude women from the priesthood \n\nAnd so that’s \nUm \nI think that \nThat they could change their position on that \n\nThey’d be more intoned with that \n\nUm \nLets see \nActually the Catholic Church \nWell its it’s an interesting situation cause there actual are some priests who are married \nUm \nSometimes if um \nA man who is previously of a \nOf a different religious faith wants to become a Catholic and a priest and who already is married \nUm \nThey actually do allow them to do that \n\nWhich is \nWhich I thought was interesting and if they do allow that and some very extreme circumstances \nI wonder \nI wonder why they wouldn’t allow it in general \nAlthough I do see the argument \nUm \nI do see the validity of the argument against it \nI guess the priest is supposed to devote his whole life to \nTo the Church and \nAnd to god and so \nUm \nAnd so he needs all his time and his energy to do that \nAlthough because priests can’t marry and there has been um \nA decline in the number of priests um \nThe role of \nOf um \nDeacon’s has become a lot more prominent \nThere have been a lot more Deacon’s because they’re allowed to marry \n\nAnd really there \nThere responsibilities are not \nAre not \nThere’s a few major \nThere a few major differences but \nUm \nBut a lot of their responsibilities are very similar to those of priests \nAnd so \nSo \nSo I guess there’s \nThere’s a little inconsistency there \nBut um \nIn terms of the accusations against the Catholic Church with priests and abusing boys and stuff like that \nUm \nIt \nI guess in terms of \nI think there \nI mean there have been cases where priests have covered up for other priests or maybe they didn’t investigate as much as they should have \nI \nI think women probably would have \nWould have been more likely to \nTo \nTo investigate and to \nTo reveal probably what was \nWhat was going on \nUm \nUm \nI’m not \nIt’s horrible \nI’m not really sure how they were \nHow they let it go on for so long \nBut uh \nWhat am I trying to say \nUm \n\nUm \nThe Catholic Church I think I \nI agree with a lot of their doctrines and their principles and I think that there thoughts on the way we should live in the 21st century are \nAre still \nThere thoughts on how we should live are still important \nStill remain even as we are in the 21st century \nUm \nAnd \nAnd I think a lot of the stuff \nA lot of the things that the Catholic Church does is \nIs um \nVery helpful and very important in the 21st century \nAnd then \nBut also looking within its own structure there’s probably a lot that could be done \n\nUm \nA lot \nA lot of changes that could be made that would better reflect society in the 21st century and the \nThe changing roles of women \n\nYeah \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "Uh  \nI absolutely think that the Catholic Church needs to change its ways to adapt \nI mean it’s done it before \nLike the Vatican and the Vatican II \nUm \nCouncils \nThey \nThere’s certain laws and certain things that are antiquated and don’t belong in our society anymore.\nI mean for one the fact that priests can’t marry \nThat was never a religious thing \nIt was bought in as a political ploy \nPolitical, financial ploy \nUm \nWhen priests \nIn the beginning of the Catholic Church priests were marrying and they were having children and then the land on which they had built their church was going to their sons rather than the church \nSo the church decided that it would no longer allow priests to marry \n\nUm \nAnd frankly, I think that it prohibits them from leading a full life \nIt prohibits them from being able to understand what some of their flock may be going through \nSo um \nAnd also I’m speaking from a non-Catholic perspective \nI was raised both Catholic and Lutheran, but I also grew up seeing a priest without a family and a pastor with a family \nAnd the pastor was able to relate much better to what was going on in the daily lives of his congregation, rather than the priest \nUm \nAnd then there are other things as well as um \nThe use of contraception \nThe use \nThe allowance of females into the ministry \nUm \nI understand that back in the middle ages women were seen as subversive and underneath and lower than men and much more open to sin thanks to Eve and the Bible, but frankly the Bible did not arrive by facts from heaven \nIt was written by man \nSo they can’t really say that women are more susceptible because of Eve \nAnd then also women now today are seen as equal to men \nThey are not lesser \nUm and I think that by the church \nBy having the church disallow women to be priests I think that it’s only adding to gender discrimination that we have a problem with already \nUm \nAnd it just \nThere are many things about that church that are also \nTrying to go back \nI mean Benedict has also said that he wants mass spoken in Latin again \nAnd no one speaks Latin these days \n\nNot conversationally \nSo it’s \nIt causes problems within the general population in that you’re putting stress on your people to learn something or else they’re not gonna understand \nAnd then part of it is that even when mass was spoken in Latin \nPeople didn’t understand \nSo why would you want to throw your people back into an era where they’re not understanding what’s going on in your church?\nUm \nThe church I think needs to move up \nIt needs to move up with the times again \nIt has before \nI don’t think that the church is infallible like many people seem to think \nUm \nIt seems to me that the church is kind of stuck in a rut and can’t escape and \nI mean it didn’t take steps forward when Pope John Paul was Pope, but now that he’s died it seems to be taking \nYou know \nAnother step back \nSo I’m really not sure what to think anymore with the Catholic Church \nUm \nAnd I know I’m not the only one \nI have a lot of other friends that are Catholic who are questioning their faith because of what the church is doing and the fact that the church isn’t stepping up \nUm \nAnd I mean to me, the fact that the church is so against gay marriage, and the fact that the church is so against contraceptives \nTo me, God is not \nIf there is a God, God is not stupid enough to say, no you’re going to hell because of who you love \nOr you’re going to hell because \nYou know \nYou’re married so you didn’t feel like \nAnd you didn’t feel like having another child \nLike that’s not the way it works \nI think Christianity is more forgiving \nOr it should be \nUm \nCause it has that whole turn the other cheek thing \nThat’s a nice little addendum \nSo \nSometimes I think the church should actually look at what they’re doing \nAnd sometimes I think it gets away from them because they are such a large organization that things get away from them \nAnd they don’t think to look back \nThere would probably still be some of it because \nYou know who \nDifferent strokes for different folks \nNot that I say it’s right \nBut um \nBut I think that most of it could have been \nYes, I think \nEveryone needs someone to love and needs someone to love them \nWhether they’re a priest or not \nThat doesn’t matter \nThey’re still human \nI think a lot of people forget that priests are still human \nUh \nThey expect them to be more and better and perfect and they’re not \nThey’re gonna make mistakes just like everybody else \nThey’re going to \nAnd I think sometimes having someone there \nWith you \nBeside you \nWatching your life and you’re watching them \nI think sometimes it helps you to keep a better grip on what you’re doing \n\nAnd keep yourself grounded \nUm \nAnd I think that if priests are allowed to marry they wouldn’t have gone looking for it in a place other than they already have it \nUm \nNope.\n",

\nNo harm done \nEspecially when everyone’s trying to be so pro-marriage now when there’s this whole pro-marriage, pro-family movement \nWhich is good \nI mean in all sorts of places \nI mean in Baltimore there are billboards up \nUh there’s one in Govan’s \nThere’s one in Park Heights \nI saw a couple in West Baltimore \nWith this big campaign called marriage works and it has a like a website, an 800 number, and you can get to counseling and all sorts of stuff like that \nAnd I mean \nSo I mean civil union \nYeah \nIt’s fair \nIt would never, never, never pass \nIt was a political move that he made just to appease a lot of his support base \nAnd that is absolutely clear \nI mean do you really \nI mean think about what has to happen for a Constitutional Amendment to pass \nIt has to be passed in Congress \nI believe two thirds \nAnd then it has to be ratified by the states individually \nThat means that every single state would have to \nWould have to ratify that Constitutional Amendment \nAnd the handful of states or at least \nAnd you know \nThat would create a sort of a legal crisis \nUm \nThe likes of which I don’t think we’ve really seen since the civil war or since the equal rights amendment \nUm \nAnd it would never pass \nAnd so therefore as a project \nAs a legislator to take on a project that you know is absolutely unfathomably hopeless \nUh then \nI mean if you take on that type of project \nWell then it’s obvious that you’re motivations can’t be serious \nI mean he is smart guy \nSo I mean he \nI mean he wouldn’t waste his time on that \nUm \nBut it was just to appease a lot of this support base that wanted to feel \nBecause I mean a lot of people feel very strong in their beliefs \nAnd you know you have to be very respectful of that \nAnd a lot of people were saying oh well you know we don’t want this to happen \nAnd so I mean President Bush doesn’t really have to power to enact legislation per say beyond executive orders and federalizing national guards and that sort of thing \nI mean he can’t really write federal statutes \nThat’s Congress’s job \nSo I mean he’s like, yeah I’m gonna propose this amendment \nAnd I mean it would never happen \nI think he just wanted it on his record that he opposed it \nYou know that he wanted to stand up and say, well this is want them to believe so that then the history books can say look at President Bush \nOh yeah well he was against gay marriage and uh you know \nUm \nI think \nI mean when you’re talking about something like this you could \nI suppose that you could either way \nEither way you could argue this either way \nAnd I would tend to lean towards the side of \nUh \nEven though marriages only happen in one state, they’re effective in all fifty states \nUm \nAnd the way that we’re progressing now is towards a sort of polarization of the states themselves where some states say yes and some states say no \nSo then you have people \nSo then I mean if you’re gonna end up with people eloping or flying half way across the country just to get married \nWell then \nMaybe the federal government could do something about it \nBut then if the federal government did do something about it \nStates like Utah would just refuse to comply and Texas would probably just refuse to comply \nAnd um \nSo \nI mean \nMaybe it is better decided by the courts in the states \nBut if the federal government doesn’t get involved then all federal legislatures and elected officials \nYou know all three branches have to stop using the term activist judges \nBecause if they aren’t gonna step in \nWell then those activist judges aren’t really activist judges \nThey’re the ones who are just stepping up and taking the function that the federal government is deferring to them \nAnd just because they disagree with one particular point of view doesn’t necessarily make them activists  \nI mean they’re judges \nIt’s their job to decide \nYou know \nThese types of things and if a case like that comes up and if a homosexual couple is suing the state and has a compelling argument \nI mean and it has worked in other jurisdictions and that gives you know some persuasive jurisdiction then if a judge is San Francisco or one in Boston or a city magistrate in San Francisco or Boston says go ahead and do it well then \nUnless the federal government is going to enact a sweeping legislation \nWell then, that’s going to go ahead and happen \nI mean and I think that the Supreme Court does not want a landmark case like this yet \nI mean the issue will have to develop a lot more \nUm \nBefore it really comes to a head \nAnd once it comes to a head then the Supreme Court will step in \nBut until then I don’t think so \nI mean if you look at landmark cases like \nUm \nLike Runner versus Ballinger or Brown versus Board of Education is a good one \nYou know Shaw versus Reno or any of these you know \nIt took a while for them to step in for these until the problem came to a head and it became compelling for them to do so \nEspecially with this Chief Justice \nI mean he doesn’t really \nThis Supreme Court has heard fewer cases than any Supreme Court in I think since the Warren Court I believe \nAnd so \nHe’s not gonna step into til he has to \nBut for now I guess it’s not bad \nIt can be left in the hands of the states \nUh \nNo \n\n\n",
        "Um \nOn this one also I’m like really mixed \nI have really mixed feelings about \nUm \nJust the fact that they call it gay marriage \nLike I think that marriage is between a man and a woman \nIt’s a religious sacrament \nAnd like that’s just what it is \nAnd you can’t really change the meaning of it \nLike you can’t say that it \nCause it’s like \nIt’s like pretty much solely meant for like procreation \nLike the word marriage \nAnd like that’s not obviously what gays would be doing \nAnd I’m not sure if I agree with calling it gay marriage \nI have no problem with them just being like recognized by the state as a married couple \nLike as a couple that’s together \nI have no problem with that \nUm \nI just \nIt’s the fact that they call it marriage that bothers me \nAnd I think that \nUm \nI think they’re main concern is just being recognized \nAnd I just think that \nI mean it sounds funny \nBut they should even come up with like \nJust another word for it \nAnd like \nUm \nI think that they really want to be recognized by the church \nAnd I’m really not sure why because I mean \nIt’s not that God has said that he’s against gay people \nHe’s just like \nLike in religion like they’re \nThe church is against gay acts \nSo unless you’re a gay couple that doesn’t engage in homosexual acts then \nI mean you shouldn’t get \nYou shouldn’t you know \nBe married \nLike cause it’s not accepted by the church and I don’t really know why they want to be accepted by the church if it feels that way \nSo that kind of confuses me \nUm \nUm \nSo I don’t know \nIf they came up with like another word or another way that they could just be recognized by everyone that they’re a couple and whatever \nI think that’s fine \nI have no problem with that \nBut it’s just the marriage thing that throws me off \nAnd that’s really it \nNo I don’t \nI don’t think the government should have any ruling over the personal lives of people \nLike we have \nI mean I’m pretty sure they have much larger things to worry about whereas this could be taken care of by just another part \nLike it doesn’t have to be the President who like makes a law about it \nI think that’s really stupid \nI don’t think it’s any of their business \nUm \nAnd I really don’t \nI really don’t think a lot of people care what he thinks about it \nUm \nEspecially knowing like his stance on religion and how conservative he is \nI think everyone knows you know what he would think \nBut um \nYeah I don’t think they should have any say in it because it’s not \nI just don’t think it’s any of their business \nUm \nI think they should be more focused on what’s going on with the things in Iraq and just other things that they should just do their job \nSo I think that’s just \nI think people just want to know like what President Bush is thinking just so they can get more angry at them \nAnd I don’t think \nI think it’s stupid \nSo \nYeah \nUm \nUm \nI just think that for some reason like I know people hate Bush and I think they just like to see \nLike just get a rise out of him and see what he’s thinking about it \nJust so they can like go against it \nBut I really \nI really don’t think it’s any of the government’s business \nI think this is between the gays and the church and they’re pretty much battling it out just to be recognized as married \nBut I don’t see why they want to because the church doesn’t accept them \nI mean like \nThey do accept them as people \nBut not with what they do \nSo I don’t understand why they would want to be recognized like by the church \nUm \nSo \nI don’t know \nThat just really confuses me and kind of gets me angry \nLike if the \nI don’t understand why they would want some institution to recognize them if the institution doesn’t accept them for what they’re doing \nLike they’re cause \nSo I don’t know \nThat just throws me off \nSo \nNo \nOk \n",
        "Um \nFor gay marriage \nI feel that it’s definitely something new and different and that if people want to get married who are of the same gender \nYou shouldn’t call it marriage \nYou should call it something else because marriage typically is defined as a union between a man and a woman \nAnd I know a lot of religions \nUm \nView it only as that \nLike the Catholic religion \nMarriage is only between a man and a woman and you can’t change that definition \nAnd so \nI’m not typically \nI’m not against same sex people living together and receiving the same benefits as a married couple viewed in the eyes of the church \nI just feel like you should call it something different so that they can have I guess \nSomething more personal than a civil union because even a male and a female can enter into a civil union \nBut, um \nFrom my understanding \nSo, I feel that if they come up with a new term other than marriage it will be more widely accepted \nUm \nAnd I feel that it’s kind of tricky to say like if it should be allowed or not \nUm \nFrom state to state \nI definitely feel that it should be allowed once a new term is formed \nAnd accepted \nUm \nI’m not really sure if individual states should have a say on whether they allow those types of ceremonies to take place \nUm \nI guess \nNo, I guess I take that back \nI feel um \nIt should be openly accepted in all states to unify our country because if you have one state \nHow we have it now \nWe have one state saying oh yeah well marry people of the same sex and another state being totally opposed \nThen that’s kind of disunifying our country \nSo I feel that they should be accepted in all states once that new term is in place \nUm \nI do feel that the federal government should be involved in having it that all states should accept it \nI don’t feel that it’s correct in George Bush’s push for an amendment because that is a personal choice, not something that the country \nLike that effects the country in that way \nLike voting \nThat definitely effects the entire country \nBut \nAnd like freedom of speech \nThat effects all the people \nBut, like having someone ban someone else from marrying someone of the same sex \nThat’s your own personal feelings \nYou don’t have to agree with the whole concept, but you should allow others to make their own personal choices so I don’t think it’s right that he’s pushing for an amendment \nUm \nWell I guess like as I was saying earlier that the whole country should come to an agreement on it so that way that our country is still unified \nUm \nAnd not individualized by states \nAnd um \nI guess I’m not \nI’m not saying that everyone has to agree \nBecause obviously everyone doesn’t have to agree with everything \nAnd um \nI’m not really sure what else to say about that though \nUm \nI guess I should say that once they are married or not married \nBut like whatever that term is that they’re going to invent \nThat they should be able to receive all the financial benefits and economic benefits of any typical female male married couple because that’s one of the \nThat’s probably another big reason why they’re pushing for marriage cause not only to like commit to each other just as a man and female would \nBut, it’s also to like help each other out financially and grow as people together \nUm \nEconomically as well as like personally \nUm \nI don’t think so \nI think that’s it \n\n",

        "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
        "Um \nGender discrimination \nWell I mean there’s a wage gap \nI know that much \nUm \nBut I wouldn’t really say that gender discrimination is a huge problem \nI know that there’s a wage gap but I think that in terms of \nI mean when \nWhen you think of discrimination you think of disparity of opportunities \nAnd I think that in terms of disparity of opportunities there is a disparity between men and women \nBut it’s nowhere near as drastic as the disparities that are along racial lines or geographic lines or \nI mean kids you know \nI mean for instance \nLike access to education I think is a much bigger particular problem than \nEducation discrimination because every child in a particular neighborhood growing up is going to afford a public education whether they’re a boy or a girl \nAnd then in theory they would have similar opportunities to succeed \nUm \nBut you know \nWhat does that public school look like? \nHow much money does it have to spend? \nDo they have transportation to get there? \nI mean the answer \nIs the fundamental \nDoes that school have enough materials, enough teachers \nI mean I think that that is a much more pressing form of discrimination than gender discrimination is so \nAlthough it may exist \nUm \nI think if we’re going to put our efforts into battling discrimination I think it’s kinda institutionalized these problems \nUm \nIn terms of geographical separation which leads to racial discrimination \nUm \nWould be something to tackle first \nIn the workplace or otherwise?\nUm \nNot \nI mean I’m sure that there might be specific examples \nUm \nBut I mean living in a society that has kind of progressed out of this sort of nuclear family male breadwinner mother thing through kind of  feminism and the Betty [inaudible] age to kind of a \nA \nA \nPlace of parody where we are now \nI think that there are remnants of \nUh \nOf some discrimination towards women left over \nBut I think not particularly towards men on anything \nI mean \nI mean I’m sure it exists somewhere \nBut I wouldn’t say it’s like a stemming problem \nUh \nWith regard to gender or \nUm \nI mean there are plenty \nPlenty of success stories of women who are \nWho are driven and smart and just as capable as men \nAnd I \nI don’t really think there’s too much of a disparity in capability relatively between women and men \nUm \nSo I mean it \nI mean it’s really tough cause I guess the only real tangible sort of discrimination that I can think of off the top of my head in terms of gender would be the wage gap \nUm \nBut a lot of those \nI mean who knows how particular companies determine how they pay people \nAnd I mean it’s not like you can just make some kind of legislation where the government would just step in and say oh well your pay scale has to follow all these certain algorithms \nI mean I don’t feel like I could ever really picture that flying \nUm \nSo \nI mean all in all I can’t really think of anything off the top of my head \nI’m probably gonna think of something in like four or five hours and then say, hey I wish I had said that \nUm \nUm \nNo \n",

        "Wait can you repeat the question\n\nO like they said they were going\nGonna\n\nOkay\n\nUm\nWell let’s see \nMyspace is on the internet which is \nVery public\n\nAnyone can have access to it\nAnd when people choose to create a Myspace they’re made aware of that any \nUh\nAnyone can see\nUm\nWhat’s what you put on there and it’s part of a persons a persons own responsibility to understand that what they put on there can be see by anyone \nAnd so it’s it’s there and so it’s \nIt’s not an invasion of privacy because there’s no illusion that this is a private enterprise\nBecause it’s not It’s made open to anyone \nWho who joins who joins Myspace \nAnd \nUm\nAnd so \nTeachers like everyone else can see whatever whatever is on there\nAnd and it’s great if they were able to prevent a school shooting \nUm by doing that\n\nI mean \nUm\nGosh my mother teaches at an elementary school \nAnd I remember\nLast year there was an incident that occurred that having something to do with Myspace \nUm a group of students had formed this sort of\nHate group \nUm \nDirected towards another student in the class \nAnd the principal became aware of it\nAnd so I forget exactly what the repercussions were\nBut I think that the students were reprimanded somehow\nBut then they had a whole big meeting about it with parents \nAnd teachers\nAbout about Myspace\nUm\nAnd the dangers it posses \nAnd things like that\nI mean kids\nI mean you just have to be have common sense really\nAbout whatcha your going to \nWhat what things about yourself you’re going to put on there \nWhat thoughts to express on there\nBecause it’s\nIt’s the internet nothing\nNothing is really secure\nAnd \nUm\nI think that teachers have have every right to \nUm\nLike everyone else to to \nUm\nTo to look at whatever it is you’re choosing to put out there\n\nUm\nWere you going to say something\n\nIn terms of the internet\n\nI mean\nUm\nOk well \nThey have \nThey have the freedom to\nTo access the internet and to access the internet so I guess \nThen the question would be \nBased on what they find \nOn someone’s Myspace or something like that \nWhat right do they have to then question the student or to look in the student’s locker or something like that \nBecause I guess that’s what they probably would have had to have done\nHave to do to \nFoil the students plan\nUm\nAnd I think \nI think because it’s it’s school property all \nUm\nI think all schools have the right to look through a student’s locker\nUm\nActually a couple of years ago in my high school \nWe had um a lockdown drill\nAnd \nBut the purpose of it was so that the school could\nUm\nSo that the police could come in and search for drugs\n\nIn in students lockers \nAnd um \nI mean students shouldn’t shouldn’t be doing anything illegal like that anyway\nAnd I mean if you’re stupid enough to bring anything like that to school with you \n\nI just think you deserve to get caught\nI mean \nHahah\nMaybe that sounds harsh \nUm\nAnd I mean the same thing\nIf you’re bringing \nIf you’re bringing weapons to school \nOr something like that \nI mean these teachers by by taking these actions were able to they were able to prevent a school shooting\nI think that’s \nI mean \nBecause I mean if you’re if you’re you’re you’re in a school and \nUm \nSo there’s \nUh\nSafety is really what’s most important\n\nUm\nSafety of of all the students\nAnd so I don’t think that the teachers really did anything wrong\nAnd um\nAnd I’m trying to think what else teachers could do\nTo invade privacy\nUm\nI mean like I know\nWell coming to college I remember during our orientation I think it was summer orientation\nUm\nBecause I’m a I’m a\nBefore um freshman year\n\nAnd I remember people talking they had talked to us about Facebook\nBecause that’s the big thing now\n\nFacebook\nAnd they said you know I mean\nBe smart about what you put on there\nBecause if you put\nI mean if you put up pictures of you\nYour drunken escapades on the weekend\n\nAnd then you\nAnd this is a website on the internet that anyone can \nYou know can look at\nAnd then so if you’re trying to get a job and your employers \n\nSee that then \nThat’s gonna reflect bad on you \nSo I think \nUm\nEspecially in terms of the internet\nJust it’s\nIt’s \nThe person makes the choice to put themselves out there\nAnd put out information about themselves when they know that it’s it’s not secure\nAnd it’s not private and so they shouldn’t have any expectations about security or privacy\n\nAnd so when a student goes to school they need to understand that safety is one of the most important things for all of the students \nAnd so they should expect that safety\nThat the school’s priorities \nThat is to keep the children safe \nAnd so\nSome things that may be perceived as invasions of privacy are are necessary\n\nUm\nJust in terms of school or in\n\nUh\nNo\nNo I think that’s it\n\n",
        "Um \nI don’t think that is an invasion of privacy because \nUm \nI mean if this was posted on \nLike one of his \nMaybe like a screen name or something like that I would maybe think it was an invasion of privacy \nBut Myspace is like a totally public website where anyone can view it \nIt’s not even like Facebook where you supposedly have to have a college email address to have one \nUm \nSo I definitely don’t think that it’s an invasion of privacy because it’s a public website where anyone can have access to it \nUm \nAnd especially if it’s gonna prevent something like that \nThen I don’t see how anyone could think it was an invasion of privacy \nCause that’s such a big deal \nAnd it was something so small that prevented something that could be like so disastrous \nSo I mean like I don’t think that was an invasion of privacy at all \nIt’s just because anyone could have one \nUm \nIt like \nFacebook you have to have a college email address and so at least there’s like a set community I guess you could say \nLike with Myspace it’s like anyone of any age could have a Myspace \nAnd post anything on it that they want \nAnd if people are seeing that someone’s posting threats or like something like that \nI don’t see why they can’t report that or look further into it \nI mean if this kid didn’t want anyone to see that he shouldn’t have posted in on his Myspace \nI didn’t know why he would have \nUm \nSo \nAnd even like just \nI don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy \nCause it’s nothing private \nI don’t think they went into his email or anything like that \nSomething that is private \nSo \nI mean like phone tapping and stuff like that \nLike I would see how that is an invasion of privacy \nBut I think that \nYou have to trust that the government or whoever’s doing it is doing it is for a reason \nAnd there’s like a legit I guess reason that they would do that \nLike they’re suspecting you of something or anything like that \nAnd if you have nothing to hide I don’t see why that would be such a big deal \nEspecially if it could prevent these terrorist attacks that we’ve been having or anything like that \nSo \nI don’t \nI don’t see a reason why people should get upset about it \nUm \nPersonally I don’t \nI don’t think there should be a line drawn if there’s a reason that they \nLike I said if they have a reason that they should be looking into this student’s business I don’t see a reason why they shouldn’t or a reason why they can’t \nEspecially if that kid is enrolled in their institution and they’re just trying to protect it \nEspecially if they didn’t have a good reason for looking on his Myspace or whatever like \nJust like at student life here if they don’t have a good reason for looking on someone’s Facebook or anything like that \nI think that’s an invasion of privacy \nBut if that’s a good reason I don’t see why they can’t do it or they shouldn’t be allowed to \nIf it could prevent something like a school shooting \nNope \nOk \n",

        "Yeah I do feel that gender\nUh\nDiscrimination is still an issue especially when it comes into the workplace\nYou don’t see as many women as there should be going out and getting jobs\nBecause people still have that\nUh\nExtremely conservative mindset that women belong in the house\nAnd I think that’s more or less women aren’t\nUh allowed to go out in to workplace\nI think that it’s not more or less that women aren’t \nUh\nAllowed to go out into the workplace\nI think that it’s just the continuation of that mindset\nAnd the roles that people see in the homes\nAnd the way children are growing up \nAnd they see their mother always cooking staying at home\nThere’s still a bunch of stay at home moms that are just home all day\nAnd the children think of it that way\nSo they grow up with that mindset\nAnd they feel that they don’t really\nThink to themselves\nThat ok this is how it should be\nBut it just kind of grows with them as they grow older\nAnd it’s more of a subconscious\nUh\nIdea for them\nAnd what I think could change this\nI think that if people were to\nUh\nProbably try and just change themselves in the household\nRather than going out into the streets\nAnd trying to force everybody to change their minds\nBecause this force I believe just kind of has a negative impact on people in general\nIf you try to force someone to do something\nYou’re just going to be creating more tensions than are really necessary\nEspecially when it comes to gender discrimination\nOr any kind of discrimination in general\nBecause if you’re trying to force someone to change\nPeople are just going to begin to look at the opposite sex\nOr opposite race\nOr whatever it may be \nAs more of a negative light because you are trying to force it on them\nWhereas if it’s more of a mutual decision\nMaybe\nUh\nI don’t know\nThrough just \nUh\nIf you just were to let the mindsets change over time\nMaybe not a really long period of time\nBut just let it evolve \nAnd eventually we can probably see it deteriorate to the point where it is virtually nonexistent\n\nUh\nI wouldn’t\nMaybe if reverse discrimination \nWhen people are trying to \nUh\nUh \nHire more women or something\nAnd especially when it comes to jobs like nursing\nAnd all of that\nYou don’t typically see men in those fields\nSo I think that there might be some discrimination in there \nBut I don’t think that it’s really that much\nNot as high of a percentage as it is for women\nAnd I don’t really see that discrimination against men as a problem that is really in existence\nI think that it is more of the other way around\n\nUh\nBecause\nI don’t know\nYou typically see men being able to do whatever they want \nI mean\nMost men don’t really have to worry about\nHave their employers going to have to pay them half the pay that they would pay a woman \nBecause I don’t know \nMost companies\nAnd any kind of business that discriminates against gender\nOr a specific gender\nIt’s usually toward women\nSo men don’t really have to worry about that too much\nAnd I feel like sometimes they take advantage of that \nAnd kind of use that to enforce\nOr develop beliefs like that they’re a man\nSo they’re kind of in a higher up position \nI don’t see it really\nMuch a problem\nAs it is to\nUh\nFor women\n\nUh no\n\n",
        "Alright \nMmhmm \nOk \nNo I don’t think it’s an invasion of privacy \nEspecially because the internet is a free-for-all \nAnd I really do think that \nI think that for school officials is \nThey should be more \nI mean it’s Ok for school officials \nI know even at my high school they had \nUm \nLike they had Myspaces and they had Facebooks just to check up on what students were saying \nAnd, yes, I mean it’s an invasion of privacy in the sense that that’s a place for kids to go on \nLike go somewhere and not \nAnd just say whatever they want because the whole idea of having like a diary is out the window because someone can actually find your diary \nAnd like nine times out of ten your parents can go into your room and find your diary \nYour parents can’t hack onto the computer \nHack into like the Myspace, find out what’s your password is and find out what you’re saying \nLike very few parents can actually do that \nSo I think that’s just like a place where kids can just kinda go and say whatever they need to say and have whoever they like whatever they have on their mind like say it \nBut for things like that \nLike saying preventing like a school shooting \nIf there’s any like \nThings like that are like necessary \nIf you see \nIf you see on Myspace someone saying anything about killing someone \nKilling themselves \nAnything that would hurt someone \nYes, that’s Ok because kids should know that the internet is like a big free-for-all \nAnd so people can see it \nBut when they want to do \nWhen they want to say like \nOh like \nI don’t know teenage problems nowadays \nBut any small teenage problem that they may have and put it like online \nBut as long as it’s not hurting themselves or anyone else \nI think that’s fine \nBut like in my old high school \nCan we talk about stuff like this? \nOk \nAt my old high school these girls got \nUm expelled \nBecause it was an all-girls Catholic high school and they were in the bathroom \nUm \nWith the school uniform on like just doing like \nI guess you could call it sexual female on female like actions or whatever \nBut it was like \nThe thing is like people do stuff like that all the time \nEven in teachers’ faces they did it \nBut the fact is like they put it online \nAnd for everyone to see \nAnd so the reason why they got expelled \nAnd I think that’s actually not fair because it is a free \nIt’s like \nI mean how do they know that like \nI think the main thing is that they were messing with the school’s reputation and they didn’t want the school to be known as a place that accepts \nUm \nLike gay \nGay interactions like that \nWhich is understandable \nBut it’s also like \nYou know \nThen tell them not to go on the internet \nAnd tell them not to put whatever they want on the internet \nIt’s like and now like the more and more \nYou know \nSchool officials get keen to this the more and more like \nCause kids nowadays are really, really smart \nAnd they will find a way to make sure that you don’t know their information \nAnd there are so many ways like people will have to \nIf you can like be on a college campus and people have ways of selling fake ID’s \nThere are ways in which \nLike the school officials know they’re selling \nBut they don’t know who’s doing it because like the students are so secretive \nImagine what can happen online and imagine what can happen through technology \nLike a lot of kids are really, really smart about things nowadays \nAnd if they don’t want you to find something, they’ll make sure you don’t find it \nAnd I feel like \nI think like that \nUm \nSchool officials are just trying to, yes, keep everyone safe \nBut you know if you had us sometimes like \nCause the fact that like I’m a RA \nActually and it’s like my motto’s like if you can’t beat em join em \nAnd it’s like \nAnd I’m an RA as a freshman \nAnd so like if you can’t \nThey’re \nThe freshman are gonna drink regardless of what you say \nSo you might as well understand that they’re gonna do it and help them do it \nAnd I think that leads to the whole thing with this whole privacy issue \nLike be open to them \nDon’t like be like this big school figure that is \nYou know they’re not gonna want to talk to you \nLike be like that person that they can come and talk to you cause nine times out of ten if they have someone to come talk to \nThey wouldn’t have to write that online \nLike do they even know that that person’s gonna really like kill people at school \nAnd it’s sad cause like nine times \nThe reason probably why like they got like to immediate action was the whole thing with like V-tech and stuff like that \nBut they don’t really know and I think it’s because of these people it’s understandable \nIt’s really hyped up now \nAnd that person \nWhoever did that \nHe should have been smart \nBut obviously it might have been like he really was gonna do it \nBut it’s also like you know \nYou gotta give people \nLike give teenagers that little space cause that’s like what they need at that time \nThey just need that space to kinda grow and develop their own ideas \nWell I think that they should draw the line at the fact that \nUm \nIf the students are not going to harm themselves or harm anyone else than it’s fine \nIf they want to just express who they are \nExpress you know \nJust express things that they probably couldn’t do elsewhere \nJust stuff like that is Ok \nAs long as it doesn’t go into hurting themselves and other people \nThen that’s fine \nLike it’s Ok just to say like \nTo do like what I think the girls at my high school did \nAnd just like you know \nDid some \nEven people in college do like sexual girl on girl actions \nBut they don’t necessarily mean it \nBut they do it \nSo I feel like stuff like that is Ok \nBut when it comes to possibly \nI feel it’s Ok for what the school officials did because they didn’t know if it was true or if it was false \nSo that was Ok \nBut you know they also \nThey gotta \nIt’s Ok to draw the line there \nBut anything past that \nAnything past just going on there and checking stuff out and just coming back to school and saying well I saw this on your Myspace \nThat’s not right \nThey’re there to put like Myspace and Facebook \nThey’re there so kids can put up whatever they’re feeling \nNope \nOk \n",
        "Uh\nPersonally I think that it’s an unjust war\nI thought it was in the beginning\nI didn’t really see any reason for why we should be in Iraq\nI thought\nLike originally I felt like the war was supposed be in Afghanistan where we were fighting al-Qaeda\nAnd the terrorism over there\nBut \nThen we moved to Iraq\nAnd I honestly didn’t see why it all of a sudden came into the picture\nAnd I didn’t feel that they have enough evidence in order to go in there\nAnyway in the first place\nAnd \nI felt\nI feel now that it’s continued on really\nReally long \nLonger than it was suppose to\nMission accomplished was\nUh\nMentioned a couple years back\nAnd I still haven’t seen any kind of change  \nOr in the system\nI feel that we don’t\nWe haven’t\nUh \nPut in \nUh\nA government that really is going to be stable\nAnd remain stable for several years for several years after\nWe pull our troops out of Iraq\nSo basically I feel that we’re kind of stuck there\nAnd we have to kind of bare with it until then\nAnd hopefully something good will turn out\nBut \nI honestly don’t agree with what happened\n\nYeah uh\nGeorge W.

        "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
        "Hmm \nUm \nWe only have this and then one more time that I need to talk about the Iraq War \nUm \nYeah \nI mean I feel hypocritical talking about it \nI mean I hate to say you know \nI hate to join the band wagon of people that are like oh I was against it from the beginning \nUm \nI was but like it’s not really important anymore \nCause just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t want to admit that they were wrong \nAnd um \nI mean you just have to look at like the recent polls \nUm \nThey’ve done United States polls \nThey’ve done Iraqi polls \nThey’ve done global polls \nAnd I mean no like \nAbout seventy five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks that it was a bad idea \nEighty percent of Iraqis \nUm \nSeventy percent of the troops that are over there \nLike the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year \nUm \nI don’t know \nIt’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in \nIt was already a disaster \nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster \nThere’s really no easy way to go about really anything involving the Middle East anymore \nUm \nI mean I think it’s just \nJust the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states \nI mean it’s just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations \nAnd they think that they can just like bring Democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist \nLike that’s not the way that \nUm \nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives \nI mean sure Saddam was a bad guy \nI don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he’s not \nBut, I mean you have to weight the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to \nYou know turn into just a complete disaster \nJust like quick sand from when we went over there \nUm \nI don’t even know what to say about it \nUm \nI don’t really see a reason at all to stay in there \nUm \nI mean I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there \nUm \nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out \nI don’t agree with them \nI’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should \nUm \n I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year \nUm \nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that \nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now \nUm \nI mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now \nAnd like these \nThese are the people that we’re trying to save like that we’re trying to help \nTelling us to leave \nUm \nYou know I think they might know better than that \nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens \nYou know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to \nUm \nAnd then you know at least we’ll \nI mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys \nKind of \nNot really, no \nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East \nBut, you know \nIt’ll be better than you know where we are \nWhere we stand right now \nUm \nYeah \nUh \nNo\n",
        "No I don’t think so \nBecause \nUm \nWell first of all like the internet’s public \nAnd \nAnyone has access to use it \nOr \nTo read it \nUm \nAnd \nAlso \nThe reason that it was looked at was because it was seen as a threat \nAnd \nIt could have been very harmful if they hadn’t uncovered that threat \nSo \nIf anything seems like it could be possibly harmful to other people to like the country to anything like that \nUm \nIt definitely needs to be looked into \nBecause \nIt’s regarding people’s safety \nAnd \nSafety should be of the utmost importance \nSo \nEven though someone might argue that they’re losing their privacy \nIt’s probably losing their privacy at the expense of possibly other people’s lives or safety \nSo \nIt’s definitely worth it \nUm \nPeople also probably think they have more right to privacy than they actually do \nLike it’s not a constitutional right to have privacy \nBut \nPeople come to expect it \nAnd \nThey get really mad when someone takes that away from them \nAnd \nI mean I’m not saying that you should just invade people’s privacy for no reason \nBut \nIf you do have a reason \nThen \nUh \nYou should look into it \nYou could help people by avoiding potentially dangerous situations \n\nUm \nIf they have a reason to suspect something harmful going on \nThen I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy that should be prevented \nI think that should be encouraged \nUm \nBecause \nWe don’t want harmful things to happen \nBut \nIf they just like are snooping around for no reason \nThat’s not really necessary \nAnd \nThere’s no point in doing that  \n\nUm \nDo you have anything in particular?  \n\nOK \nUm \nI guess just depending on how many other people it would influence \nUh \nIf they suspect that someone’s plotting something against say an entire school \nWell that could influence the whole group of students at that school \nAll their parents \nEverybody who knows those people \nThat would be a major thing for \nUm \nLike in the situation you described \nBut \nIt’s not reasonable for school officials to just \nYou know \nThink someone’s \nUh \nI don’t know \nLike \nCheating on a test or something \nAnd \nLike explore their whole background \nAnd \nEverything about them for a reason like that \nI think the main distinction would be whether people’s lives and safety are jeopardized by a situation \nAnd \nIf they are then it’s ok to invade privacy \nAnd \nIf it’s not then don’t do it \n\nNope \n\n",
        "Alright \nUm \nWell yeah I mean I definitely \nI mean you can’t really like say that it’s not an issue like it’s just like a question of like what can actually be done about it \nUm \nLike I know like laws enacted \nUm you know \nAgainst like racism \nAgainst races \nYou know other cultures exist \nUm \nBut, like I don’t really know like what our country can do about like a problem with sexism \nUm \nAnd since it’s like the racism laws clearly aren’t working like \nI feel like we need a totally different way of \nYou know \nApproaching both problems really \nUm \nDo I just keep talking? \nDo you want to ask a question? \nWell I mean I think \nI mean I think it will always be true \nI mean I don’t think you can really avoid you know social stereotypes no matter what laws you enact \nI mean it’s always going to be present in people’s minds \nThere’s always going to be sexists, there’s always going to be racists \nUm \nI mean I’m sure like \nJust like the differences that are inherent in men and women \nUh \nLike I mean cause there to be difficulties \nAnd like differences and what kind of jobs \nUm are offered \nJust cause people can’t look past \nUm \nYou know some of these things \nI mean if you’re getting a job that requires \nUh \nLike more like grunt work I guess \nI mean men are always going to be given priority for those jobs \nUm \nWhereas like certain jobs where like \nI don’t know I guess like a pretty face is needed \nUm \nLike I don’t really know what \nBut, I mean there are certainly some jobs that women are gonna get that men probably aren’t going to get \nUm \nIt’s kind of the reversal of that too \nUm \nWell sure \nI mean men have the same \nYou know not the same stereotypes obviously, but the same kind of social stereotyping that you know is used against women \nUm \nJust cause like \nUm \nMost people have in their minds like an ideal portrait of what a women is supposed to be and what a man is supposed to be \nUm \nAnd I think that’s always going to be there \nUm \nI don’t \nYou know I don’t really know \nBut, um \nI’m sure like just like one thing is definitely there was all this like \nAll these laws that are like being enacted to protect women in the workplace \nUm \nEven that is just kind of like stereotyping against men cause they’re painting men as you know people who are sexist against women so \nI don’t really know if that makes any sense at all \nBut \nUm \nWell I feel like just the discrimination is never going \nI mean that will never change \nI mean you’d have to change people themselves to uh really change how they feel about women \nUm \nI mean I guess the best thing to do is like learning what image we want to you know \nUh \nOur children to grow up seeing of what a woman is and what a man is and just like you know educate them from the beginning \nCause you know in the future they’re going to be the ones who are \nUh \nGoing to be the ones who are the future sexists or non-sexists \nI mean really I thin education is the most important way to solve really any problems \nWell not you know \nNot every problem \nBut, um \nFor the future if we change the way our children feel then I mean \nThen we’ll have a lot less problems \nUm \nI mean just at like the very basic level \nI mean you look at just the word discrimination and what it means is just like to be able to tell the difference between two things \nTo be able to recognize how they’re different \nUm \nCertainly like on that level \nI mean discrimination isn’t really a bad thing \nBut, it’s just like I don’t know \nI just have a problem with using the word discrimination because we should understand our differences \nWe just you know let them you know get in the way \nUm \nWell I guess it’s just like I mean there are differences between men and women \nThat’s I mean obvious \nUm \nAnd we should know the differences between men and women \nI mean we don’t want a future where um you know men and women are the same \nI mean that just wouldn’t make any sense \nSo we should understand that there are things that men can do that women can’t do \nThere’s certain things that women can do that men can’t \nUm \nI mean that just makes the whole situation of like gender discrimination a lot harder to understand \nA lot harder to come to a solution \nUh \nAbout \nSo I mean I think we should be able to understand \nLike understand our differences, but not particularly let them impede like the jobs that women can get and women can’t get \nUm \nNot particularly \n\n",
        "Um \nThat’s a very open ended question \nI mean \nIt’s hard for me to say whether I’m against or for the war 100% \nBecause \nThere’s a lot of gray area of information I don’t know \nAnd \nI think I never will know about why we went in \nOr \nWhether it was justified \nBut \nI do believe that the major public did kind of get \nDidn’t really know what was going on \nBecause \nAfter post nine eleven it was kind of universally agreed that we needed to go to Afghanistan \nAnd \nIt kind of just blurred \nAs far as the media \nThe American media was concerned \nInto the war in Iraq \nAnd \nThere was really never any solidified conclusion to Afghanistan \nSo \nPeople just thought \nOh why are we in Iraq oh nine eleven \nAnd \nThey just went back \nAnd \nThat was their mindset about going into Iraq \nAnd \nNow it’s with no end in sight \nIt’s starting to \nWe need to start thinking about whether \nIf we’re in there for any much longer than we are right now that’d be \nUm \nWould start becoming more of a bad thing \nMore of a negative thing than it is a positive thing to change \n\nUm \nYes \nUm \nWe’re going there to like \nI really don’t even know why we’re in there any more \nBut \nAll I know is that kids my age are dying over there \nAnd \nThat’s never a good thing \n\nUm \nI really have no \nI really can’t say either way \n\nWell it’s \nI’m still \nIt’s an ongoing conflict \nAnd \nIn the future \nIf things if the events that are happening right now continue to go on \nLike if more people start dying \nAnd \nIt’s not \nWe’re not making much more of a positive change in Iraq then we should pull out \nThat’s the closest thing I could get to an answer \n\nUh \nNo \n\n",

        "Um \nUh well \nLet me start by saying \nUm \nI don’t really care what the Catholic Church does at all \nUm \nI’m not a member of any church actually \nUm \nI’m more like my own personal beliefs \nYou know just like that if you believe in a higher power I guess you’re spiritual journey or whatever \nUm \nShouldn’t have to go through like a medium of a church \nOr uh you know a Pope, bishops, they shouldn’t be someone in between you and your whatever high power you believe in \nUm \nThat being said, that uh \nThe Catholic Church does exert um \nA lot of power \nCertainly not as much as it used to \nBut still over like a ton of people \nUm \nI guess \nUm \nI mean that’s the only real problem I have with the Catholic Church \nUm \nCause I mean if you want \nI mean you can feel free to believe whatever you want \nAnd if like the doctrine of the Catholic Church is what you want to believe in that’s fine \nBut, um \nYou know it’s not necessarily so many Catholics have the opinion that that’s like the only true like religion I guess \nAnd uh \nUm \nThey’re just so many other different types of churches that um \nYeah \n I don’t really know where I’m going with that \nBut \nUm \nI mean kind of the point though is that they’re not different religion \nI guess \nI mean they’re all \nI mean yes there are different religions you can believe in \nBut um \nThe view of like a lot of Catholics that I know is that Catholicism is Christianity \nIt’s the only like \nThey don’t see these other churches I guess as Christian because \nUm they’re synonymous with each other \nUm yeah \nUm \nWell I mean that’s kind of hard just to lay blame for such \nYou know for accusations such as that \nLike just to like certain like something like that like not allowing women priests or whatever \nUm \nI mean I think \nMy opinion, a lot of these priests accusations were \nI mean they just kind of all came out at the same time \nAnd I think there may have been like a few legitimate ones \nBut just building just like people saw the money that could have been made filing these accusations \nAnd uh \nYou know it just sort of got out of control \nUm \nBut I mean I don’t think necessarily that the Catholic Church has to change though \nUm \nBecause like they’re just so many different like hate to bring up other branches of Christianity again \nBut I mean let’s say you want \nYou like the Catholic Church except for like one saying that you disagree with let’s say it’s\nUm \nThat there aren’t women priests\nUh \nI mean then there’s another church that’s you know for you that’s what you believe in \nUm \nIf you disagree with priests not being able to marry and there’s probably another church that fits that \nYou know \nUm \nSo I mean I think it’s good that there are like different uh branches of Christianity that you can believe in and that are like \nLike that display the full like range of beliefs that one may have \nMy only problem is that the Catholic Church has too big an influence \nI think if it was more \nI think a lot of people just like believe in Catholicism because it is the largest religion so they figure that must be the correct one \nUm \nI just think that needs to change \nUm \nJust I don’t know \nI mean it’s hard to like say that they need to become a smaller church because like there’s really no way that that’s going to happen \nUm \nIn fact the only thing that’s like going to turn people off from Catholicism among other religions is \nAre like when you know bad, immoral things happen within the Catholic Church \nSo you don’t really want that either \nSo I don’t know \nI guess it’s kind of a catch 22 \nUm \nYeah \n I don’t know I mean I don’t really think there’s a legitimate way to change \nUm \nLike what I feel is wrong with the Catholic Church \nSo \nUm \nNot really.\n",
        "No \nI don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy at all because anything that you put on the internet is basically fair game for anyone to see \nAnd like cause that’s why it’s called the World Wide Web \nAnd Myspace has basically no security on it whatsoever \nSo I think in a way him posting message about the possible shooting he was going to attempt was his way of reaching out for help because obviously someone’s gonna see it because it’s for everyone to view \nUm \nAnd let’s see \nSo \nYeah \nLike do you want me to continue talking about specifically the Myspace or ? \nOk \nUm \nSo yeah I guess if officials were checking out their students \nUm to see about their standings on whether they’re gonna commit crimes or not \nI feel like if you do anything on a computer that has no security towards it that it’s perfectly legal for anyone to view it and \nUm \nI’d actually almost go so far as to like encourage to go ahead and look at students’ Myspaces because often kids will post things thinking that they’re being cool if they like tell people certain things \nBut it can actually really maybe reveal some inner troubles that they’re dealing with \nAnd they can have help \nUm \nWhen people who are like older than them such as like school officials find it out and maybe the student is just too shy to ask for help or doesn’t really realize what is wrong with them \nBut like maybe the counselor sees something on a Myspace page \nThen um \nMaybe they’ll realize oh this student really has some issues \nMaybe I should talk with them and it’s kind of like a way of seeking help \nIn my opinion \nYeah \nI feel like if there’s no security on a particular site that it’s perfectly fair game for anyone to look at it \nAnd school officials are fine to look at it cause \nI mean you always want to make sure that in a school setting people are stable and school shootings don’t happen \nSo \nUm \nI think the line should be if the site \nOn for a computer has privacy settings and that student has set the privacy settings \nThen they should be honored even if there is a way for the school official to tap into it and get around it \nBecause the student obviously feels that they’re secure in expressing their thoughts and perhaps they are already seeking help and they’re just talking to a friend \nTelling them like what they’re dealing with and they don’t really want everyone in the entire world to know \nUm \nSo, I don’t think that should be violated \nAnd then I guess you can reach that out beyond the computer \nOnto like phone conversations \nI know that a lot of times now phone conversations are monitored if certain words are said like President and I guess like bomb or something \nAnd I feel like maybe there should be some criteria that should be monitored when certain words are brought up in conversations \nBut on the whole I don’t think that anyone on particular should just be zeroed in upon and just be like oh this could be a random person and maybe they’re telling something to someone that’s like really private \nWhen privacy should be invaded? \nUm \nI guess it would be beneficial again like if someone’s having problems and they’re too insecure with themselves or shy to ask for help and someone else realizes it \nThen it would be beneficial for their privacy to be invaded because someone could go to them and be like listen, I know that you’re having something problems \nAnd like I’m here to help \nSo that could be helpful \nOr if there was I guess a crime committed and people were communicating by phone like what they’re plan was gonna be or something that they’ve done and people were listening into it \nLike the government \nThen that would be helpful because that would prevent those people from preventing a crime again or even from doing it in the first place and keeping the majority of society safer \nUm \nNot really \nJust that I guess in some cases \nIn like normal scenarios \nIt should be honored if you want your privacy \nBut in other cases like such as if someone is suspicious to begin with \nThen maybe they should be monitored for a while before they’re proven to be trustworthy again \nHmm \nNo, not really \n\n",
        "Um yes I feel that the Catholic Church does need to adapt to the 21st century in some aspects, but not in all \nI do believe that they should have women as priests because right now there is actually a shortage of people going into the priesthood \nAnd the reason is because they’re not allowed to get married and that’s another thing that I think should change \nI think priests should be able to be allowed to be married because that would encourage more people to seek the priesthood and that type of lifestyle \nAnd the only reason why that rule was ever made to begin with was because back way, way in the day when popes were just starting to like gain I guess the power \nAnd the whole splitting of the church into the orthodox and everything there was corruption because they were pocketing money and like paying more attention to their families than they were to the actual religious part of life \nBut, back then for popes \nReligion wasn’t even a big part of their popedom \nIt was all political \nAnd so that’s why the rules were made into effect \nBut, obviously there is a strict line between politics and religion right now in place and I think that people are very aware of where we come from and like \nCause I’m a Catholic \nUm \nThat they’re going to be more cautious of movements that they do and that I feel if people were able to be married in the priesthood that actually it would probably be more widely accepted as a religion because I know Episcopalians and a lot of other sects of Christianity do allow that \nAnd so people are actually drawn to that because they see it as like an equality type of status versus somebody who’s above someone else \nAnd um \nI guess also that for Catholicism \nUm \nThe way that they \nI don’t know what I was gonna say \nI lost my train of thought \nYeah \nI do feel that that couldn’t happen because \nUm \nBiologically a lot of people feel the need to like satisfy certain criterion that are just normal to human beings cause we’re all animals per say \nAnd I feel that if they could marry then \nAnd have families they’d have a more stable life \nAnd a lot of the covering up by the church I feel is because they didn’t want to acknowledge the fact that molestation was going on within the religion \nAnd I feel like it was handled very poorly because they probably didn’t themselves even realize how to handle it and they thought that by moving these particular people who were offenders to particular locations would solve the problems \nBut really that’s just moving a problem from one place to another \nAnd I feel that if they dealt with the situation in a more openhanded way and like knew what they were doing and actually acknowledged the fact and tried to right the situation from the very beginning then all of this I guess negative feeling toward the Catholic Church \nUm \nWouldn’t be in place because they would realize like oh well then these are just particular people that are acting a certain way, but they’re being dealt with in a way they shouldn’t be dealt with \nAnd so in a way that was like a fault of the Pope or the officials that were handling the situation in like a hush hush type of manner \nSo I feel like it could have been handled in a very \nIn a much better way than it was \nUm \nI like it how we have a Pope because it’s kind of a unifying aspect because there’s so many different churches all around the world that are Catholic and it’s not like he’s a King or anything \nIt’s just basically he’s there to keep in place the main rules that God has establish through \nUm \nThe Bible \nAnd he’s there to like help solve disputes and set a good example for the rest of the Catholic community \nAnd while I don’t believe everything that the Pope says \nUm \nIs true \nI feel that he’s still a good example to have \nAnd um \nHe’s supposed to be like really close to God which is good \nAnd there’s a lot of types of Christianity such as Baptism or like other types like Lutheran and stuff \nOr even just like churches on their own that aren’t part of a huge segregation \nOr not segregation \nSection of Christianity \nThat it’s all up that individual church to determine what reading they do on what Sunday and like how they’re gonna go about explaining it \nAnd I feel like it’s best to have a Pope to \nUm \nDelegate \nLike Ok these readings are gonna be on this Sunday \nAll across the world \nAnd so you can take those readings and have the freedom to explain it to your listeners to how you feel is right \nBut, at least there’s someone there to be like this is how we’re gonna do it and like I trust you \nIt’s not like a King where he’s going to be like I don’t trust you \nI don’t know \nUm \nNot at the present moment \nOk\n",
        "Ok \nUm \nI definitely think it’s still an issue \nNot as prominent \nNot as like \nI guess you can’t really see it so much as you could \nUm \nBut it’s definitely still there \nEspecially in like the business setting and stuff like that \nUm \nI know from like personal experience \nUm \nMy Mom started a company when we were really young from like \nOut of \nLike out of the house \nShe ran it \nAnd um \nShe still went to like school functions and did all that like school PTA stuff \nAnd I guess other moms just thought she was a stay at home mom but like \nWhen like all of our families would get together \nLike all of the dads would talk about business and meanwhile my Mom was like running her own company \nSo it was just kind of weird that she had input about it \nAnd I don’t think they expected that \nSo um \nIt’s just \nI think that \nUm \nLike even with like younger generations we’re showing them like \nWe’re teaching them with like little flash cards with like women nurses and male doctors and like that’s there initial like \nYou know \nThat’s the relation that they have with it \nSo like women are nurses and men are doctors \nAnd that’s what they’re teaching them from when they’re very young \nSo I think that kind of like sticks with them as being like the social norm and being like that’s kind of what it has to be and it’s weird if there’s like a male nurse or a male secretary \nOr even a male like preschool teacher is kind of weird \nSo um \nI think we’re showing them that it’s like not accepted from when they’re very young so I think that has a really big impact \nAnd um \nWhat else? \nUm \nHmm \nI don’t know I just think it’s definitely more like prominent in like the work place and at home cause you really rarely see like a stay at home dad \nOr you know they’re usually the ones going out and like going to work or whatever \nAnd the mom staying home \nSo I don’t know \nI think kids are growing up with the idea of that and like they look at that as normal \nSo when they see anything else or they’re exposed to anything else they think of it as not normal or weird \nSo \nI don’t know \nI think it’s partially our fault \nUm \nFor not being like open-minded and accepting of it and I guess like teaching it to the younger generations the way we want it to be \nSo I think we have to change a lot of things like from that perspective \nAnd that’s really it [laughter] \nUm \nDefinitely \nI feel like men almost are more pressured to be like the CEO’s and the owners and things like that \nUm \nI don’t think that like \nI think that if they ever have like a job as being like someone’s secretary or someone’s like \nOr even like some \nLike and assistant to something like a nurse to a doctor or a secretary to an owner \nLike I feel like they probably feel like they’re not good enough or that they’re not looked at correctly like I feel like they feel a lot of pressure to be like that top person \nAnd like make the most money \nSo um \nI feel like there’s definitely a lot of discrimination against men and even if they wanted to stay home and I guess take care of the kids and like \nLike stay at home \nI think that they don’t even get a chance to do that because of society \nAnd I think that they would really be looked down upon for that as like weaker \nAnd that really has to change \nBut that’ll take a lot of time I think \nUm \nI guess \nUm \nI guess they’re just looked down upon as like the weaker sex I guess \nUm \nBecause they always have been \nAnd it’s been like that forever \nSo I feel like it’s just gonna take time to change that \nLike to reverse it \nUm \nSo \nThat’s about it \nUm \nNope \nOk \n",

        "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",
        "Um \nI don’t \nI haven’t really made up my mind on this matter yet \nSo \nI can’t say if either side is right or wrong \nBut \nI do believe this is the trickiest topic we’re facing today \nBecause \nSomething so close between separation of church and state \nAnd \nHow to define marriage is something that is very tricky to do without offending anyone \nSo \nI don’t know I think \nI think that the \nAll civil unions \nI don’t know whether marriage should be looked at \nAnd \nLike \nDefined by the government \nSeeing as it is a sacrament like considered \nWell people wouldn’t get tax breaks \nOr \nLooked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized \nAnd \nSo \nIf you’re married I think they should just look at it as a civil union \nBecause \nThat’s what it is \nIt’s two people \nThey shouldn’t have separation of church and state \nThey shouldn’t look into like well what kind of marriage was it \nTwo people got unioned together \nSo \nAnd \nThe fact that gay marriage \nI mean \nThat would just \nOh two people you got a civil union \n\nUm \nWell if all the states can come to a like logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law \nBut \nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous \nIt is \nSomething like the constitution shouldn’t just be amended for something \nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people \nBut \nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment \n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution \nTo define \nTo ban gay marriage \nSimply put \n\nUh \nNo \n\n",
        "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Mmhmm \nOk \nUm \nActually I think that \nUm \nIt’s such a really complicated topic \nThat I do \nI feel like people need to understand that everyone is just the same and we all are human beings \nAnd people are so focused on \nIt’s just like \nIt’s a big thing about \nLike there’s no separation of like church and state anymore \nNo separation of church and the people’s \nAnd the people’s just regular feelings because church in like many people have been so wound up into them and are apart of who they are \nThey automatically that Ok the Bible says no \nBut in realistically if you really look at it \nThey’re still human beings just like everyone else \nAnd yeah they’re things \nYeah what they do and their sexual life is not the same thing \nBut it’s kinda like \nIt’s like \nTo me it’s like another form of racism \nAlthough you can’t see it \nIt’s like saying I don’t like this person because he eats chicken \nYou don’t know that he eats chicken until he tells you that eats chicken \nAnd you don’t know that someone’s homosexual until they say they’re homosexual \nUh keep goin? \nOk \nSo I feel like you just \nYou can’t \nIt’s like another form of just not being able to just come and be who you really want to be because of the fact of other people’s opinions \nAnd I think that as \nCause in our generation \nLike in the younger generation \nWe’re like the group that is more so \nWe’re not \nWe’re like tolerant of it \nWe don’t necessarily accept it \nBut we’re very tolerant of it and we’re not like all trying to be up and in everyone’s business and trying to figure out what they do \nWe’re trying to live our lives and do what we want to do \nAnd it’s not fair to \nAnd we’re just like \nWell you know well if that’s what they want to do \nIt has nothing to do with me \nSo why do I have to be \nYou know \nIn their business, in their lives, telling them what they can and can’t do \nYou know \nIt’s just like \nAnd I think that when people look at it \nLike and make rules on the fact that gay people can’t get married \nIt’s just like I think they’re scared because I think they’re like \nIt’s like a fad \nLike you know \nIt’s just something that this generation’s going through \nIt’ll leave after a couple of years \nAnd they I think are also scared not to make any big rules and not to change anything in the Constitution \nAnd make it \nYou know \nNot do anything about it because they’re like what if this ends in a couple of years \nYou know \nAnd so they’re like what’s \nYou know \nSo I think they’re just trying to hold it off as much as possible to really see how strong it is \nAnd I think that \nYou know \nThese are one of these things that it doesn’t come without a struggle \nAnd just like \nUm \nSlavery and legalizing \nUm \nBlack \nAfrican American’s rights and even African Americans’, Latin Americans’, everyone’s rights \nThat weren’t like \nRegular Caucasians \nThey had to go through something to get it \nAnd I feel like this is one of the other things like that we have to overcome or \nYeah \nI can’t say we \nWe have to overcome \nIt’s just that we have to realize like \nWe have to just let it see if it’s something that is worth \nYou know \nBeing put into \nBeing worth legalized because in states’ laws you can say well \nYou know \nWe can change that \nAnd we can do that \nYou know \nWe can reword things \nIf you have to \nIf you put it into the Constitution of the United States \nThat’s something that you can’t change \nIt has to go through like the Senate, and the House of Representatives and all this other stuff in order to actually get amended and changed and stuff \nSo I think it’s something that we’d have to wait out and see if it’s actually \nYou know something that needs to happen \nAnd also I think that when the older generation like our parents and stuff \nWhen they \nIt’s sad to say die off \nLike when they are like you know \nPass away or whenever \nThat’s when I think a lot of the more accepting laws will start to come in \nAnd a lot of the more laws that are just like well Ok I understand and you know we’re tolerant of this and we can kind of move past like that fact that \nI don’t know \nI feel like overall, towards the end \nPeople are just gonna see they’re human too \nAnd we just need \nLike you can’t \nLike we don’t accept this human’s ways \nLike that’s not fair \nLike that’s not \nLike also like I said before \nThat’s like saying that we don’t accept the fact that you eat chicken \nIt’s kinda like \nI feel like it’s really kind of the same thing \nUm \nI don’t think they should be involved in it because of the fact that they have bigger things on their plate right now \n[laughter] \nAnd I think that while they’re \nUm \nOver there \nWhile they’re in Iraq \nLike the have the whole Iraq thing and you have people over there dieing from like what you’re doing over there \nAnd it’s not even a clear war \nBut you’re worrying about the fact over how people live their lives \nAnd like it’s weird to say because it’s like you know \nAren’t we like put \nThat’s the purpose of coming to America \nBeing able to do things freely \nAnd as long as like \nBeing gay doesn’t hurt you, it doesn’t kill you, it doesn’t \nYou know \nYes, it is one of the main things that spread AIDS \nBut the thing is like would it spread AIDS as much if it was more accepted? \nAnd would you know \nIf it was more accepted and people could \nYou could like start implementing stuff about gay marriages at school and start saying how you know it’s important for you to use like all these different contraceptives and stuff \nWill people actually be as bad as it is now? \nSo I think that personally \nUm \nLike Bush has enough stuff on his plate \nHe’s voted as like the most hated President in the United States right now \nSo [laughter] \nI don’t think he really needs to be worried about that \nAnd I think that he needs to \nI mean I think that’s also one of those things like he’s having his \nUm whole \nI forgot \nI think he’s like Methodist or Baptist or something like that \nIs his religion \nI forgot what it was \nAnd I think that if he’s letting that get in on what he wants for his \nUm \nLike for the U.S. and I swear I thought that the whole idea of government and like the church is that there’s a separation of church and state \nAnd there was a point where the government was ruled by church and was ruled by church leaders \nAnd now that’s the point of having a government \nHaving like a Pope and the bishops and stuff \nIs to keep everything separate \nI think he’s leaning on his religion instead of thinking about the fact that \nYou know \nThese are Americans and these also \nThey also have \nShould have the same rights as all the other Americans \nSo if they like \nIf they’re gay then it’s like saying well you’re not American \nAnd if you’re not American take away the citizenship \nLike that’s what you’re gonna do \nJust because of what they want to do it in their own time and their own place \nLike why not? \nYou know? \nYes, one more thing [laughter] \nAnd also I feel like definition of a marriage it’s like when who \nA couple, a domestic couple that stays under one roof for like a certain number of years \nAnd I feel like that’s \nLike in the dictionary that’s what it says a marriage is \nSo \nI feel like he’s really stuck on the whole idea of traditionally it’s always been a man and a woman \nBut imagine like how cool of a \nNot cool but like how awesome of a President he would be if he could change something \nTo do something radical \nAnd it’s like I feel like some presidents are so stuck on that \nLike that’s why I’m more \nI’m really excited about the 2008 elections because now we’re having people that are not stuck on this whole thing of you know \nNot stuck on tradition \nHere you have two Democratic presidents running to be the first woman president and the first black African American man to be president \nSo you got \nThere’s a lot of big changes about to come up \nSo \nI mean Bush is about to be president for what? \nAnother couple of months or something like that \nSo hopefully is he doesn’t \nCause he \nI mean he has all those months to make big changes like implementing \nLike say banning gay marriage and stuff \nSo \nHopefully he doesn’t do anything yet and we can hold him off \nOk not I’m done \nNope \nOk \n",
        "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",

        "Um \nI do believe gender discrimination is still an issue in the present day United States \nNot so much in the forms that it used to be \nUh \nI think it it’s only an issue today \nBecause \nIt was an issue several years ago \nUm \nBy that I mean we’re not actively trying to discriminate as much \nUm \nBy gender today as most certainly the occurrence in the business world maybe fifty years ago \nBut \nAs a result of that discrimination back then it still has leaked into today \nAnd \nIt’s proven hard for \nUm \nFemales statistically to move around within companies \nSo I think it is a problem today \nBut \nIt’s not so much an active problem \nIt’s much more sort of a lingering problem from our past actions \n\nUm \nI think to change it the only thing you can really stress is just an awareness \nUm \nKnowing that thoughts or actions may have some sort of hidden meaning \nUm \nOr hidden \nUm \nSome underlying process in your mind that is causing you to do those things when they’re not completely justified \nUm \nThe way to break any sort of discrimination or diversity issues is just to be open minded about other forms of communication \nOther forms of expression that way we’re not viewing them \nAnd \nImmediately shutting down just because they’re different \nBut \nI think if we’re just open to other forms of communication \nUm \nLinguistic styles etcetera then we’ll be able to break down the discrimination that is occurring \n\nUm \nI think you know pretty much every type of person whether it’s by gender age or whatever it is discriminated upon \nBut \nCertainly statistics would show that \nUm \nWhether it be females \nOr \nAfrican Americans are statistically much more so discriminated against \nAnd \nThe effects are shown in society and business and what not \nBut \nI mean everybody is discriminated against in the sense that some people have created stereotypes for either a male or a female or someone who’s Caucasian or Black \nAnd \nThere isn’t necessarily a justified means to the stereotype \n\nUm \nI just think that \nUm \nWhether I mean anybody has the ability to discriminate \nAnd \nIt’s not necessarily shown in much in society through statistics or through you know the CEOs of companies that males are discriminated against \nBut \nIt certainly exists because there are people out there who have preconceived notions about the way a male will behave or the way a male will communicate \nAnd \nThose communication channels have been more accepted in the business world over the past fifty a hundred years which is why that discrimination has built up against females \nBut \nIf we can start to break down those \nAnd \nUnderstand the difference in styles of expression we can also understand that discrimination is unjust \nAnd \nThat females are just as equal to males in business as well as any other arena \n\nNo that’s it \n\n",
        "Absolutely it is \nUm \nAnd both ways \nUm \nDepends on the profession \nWoah chair \nUm \nIt depends on the profession \nThere are certain professions where \nYou know are seen as the female profession and if a man is in that profession \nSay teaching or nursing \nI think teaching is changing a bit more \nBut, it’s seen as almost like it’s a little bit off \nUm \nAnd people will say it \nIt’s something that comes up \nUh \nI know it was a joke in the Meet the Parents movies that he was a nurse and not a doctor and it’s almost like, oh you couldn’t be a doctor so you had to become a nurse \nHis choice was to become a nurse and that gender \nBecause if a woman decides to become a nurse it’s because she wants to spend more time at home with her family or she just would rather be a nurse than a doctor \nUm \nAnd then you have the glass ceiling \nUm \nAnd the, the joke that if a woman is at the top in a company she had to sleep her way there \nUm \nAnd seriously if women are sleeping their way to the top why aren’t there women at the top?\nUm \nSo it’s definitely still there \nI don’t know what can be done about it because it’s one of those things that it’s a prejudice that’s kind of ingrained in people at this point \nAnd \nUm \nWe can make the conscious effort at this point to change it \nBut, I don’t think there’s anything the government can do other than saying you have to have equal wages \nWhich doesn’t happen because it’s at the discretion of the employer \nUm \nLike if a man and a woman are doing the same job sometimes the man will be paid more or less \nSometimes the woman will be paid more or less \nUm \nIt’s definitely rampant \nBut, it’s on both sides \nIt’s not just towards women or just towards men \nUm \nWhich I think is something a lot of people don’t think about \nIs gender discrimination towards men \nOh I definitely do \nI mean think about all the women that say men can’t live with them, can’t kill them \nThere’s many more like \nLike women complain about being objectified, but I think men get it too \nIt’s just it seems more acceptable almost to like oh well he’s being stupid, well it’s because he’s a man \nOr he’s being a lunk head because he’s a man \nThat’s the only thing that could be wrong?\nOr the same thing towards a woman \nOh well she must be PMSing \nCause that’s the only thing that could be wrong \nShe couldn’t be \nShe could be just a raging bitch \nExcuse my language \nShe could just be a very angry woman \nA very bitter, angry woman \nOr, yes she could be PMSing \nFor a man, he could just be having a horrible week and just taken off and not wanted to deal with anything \nBut, a lot of times like I just said it’s oh he’s being a man \nHe’s going to the gym or he’s watching football \nHe doesn’t care because \nOh it’s Ok that he’s not paying to attention to me because he’s watching football because he’s a man \nI think maybe people don’t think of that as gender discrimination, but it definitely is \nI mean \nI mean I don’t know what we can do about it except to try and make a conscious decision in everybody’s personal lives to not do it \nMake the conscious decision to not be prejudiced against someone else \nWhether it’s for gender or whether it’s for anything else \nBut, it’s here \nIt’s something that I don’t think is going to change anytime soon \nUm \nYeah \nI don’t know really what else to say about it \nUm \nNope\n\n",

        "Well gender discrimination is \nI mean \nDiscrimination I feel is always gonna \nWill always exist \nBecause \nThere’s just basic differences between like how people are identified \nAnd \nIt’s \nIn the workplace today I don’t think \nUh \nAre you taking specifically about women I’m assuming \n\nOK \nYeah well I think right now these days is very \nIt’s decreased a lot as far as like unjust practices in the workplace or in public \nBut \nUm \nThere’s always going to be a past about like \nWhat people \nHow people acted in the past \nAnd \nEven \nUm \nLike \nAs a satire like the media will have like satirize what people used to act like in the office \nLike \nGender discrimination \nLike \nNegatively towards women \nAnd \nI don’t know \nAs long as it already happened so you’ll never be able to eradicate it completely \n\nWell yeah \nWell I mean \nIt seems kinda silly \nBut \nThere’s a difference between a boy and a girl and a man and a woman \nLike physical differences \nAnd \nThere’s mental differences as well \nBut \nIt’s harder to like seek those out \nAnd \nTo find those \nLike \nMore explicitly \nBut \nJust the basic fact that like \nIn the physical sense \nLike \nThe brain will like see that before anything else \nAnd \nYou’ll just look at \nBe able to look at someone \nAnd \nThen you’ll have all these preconceived notions about how that sex is sup \nHow the member of that sex is supposed to act \nLike \nJust from what you were taught as a kid \n\nUm \nJust don’t act on \nI mean like \nPeople have these thoughts \nBut \nThey can choose how they decide to react to those thoughts \nI mean now I think \nIt used to just be \nIt shouldn’t be a problem in the fact that it was maybe fifty years ago with gender discrimination in the office \nI think \nMost of that’s been completely eradicated \nAnd \nWe just need to continue on the path of thinking before we act \nAnd \nNot letting any preconceived notions about the opposite sex get in the way of our actions \n\nUm \nNo \n\nNo \n\nYou said \nCan you repeat the question?\n\nOh I thought you said that I am ever discriminated against \n\nUm \nProbably \nI haven’t witnessed \nOr \nI haven’t \nUp until the point of this conversation I haven’t really thought about that too extensively \nBut \nI don’t know \nIn the same sense if there is a majority of women in \nWorking for a certain job \nLike \nMale nurses they probably get discriminated against \n‘Cause \nHistorically it started out as purely female nurses \nAnd \nThat would be one example \nAnd \nEven like in movies today \nLike in \nUh \nI forget what movie it was \nBut \nLike \nThe whole joke basing around the main character that he’s a male nurse \nAnd \nThat the old fashioned father of the woman he’s supposed to marry doesn’t \nLike \nAgree with a male nurse \nHe thinks it should be a woman’s job \nSo \n\nEven though it’s like a satire it still like keeps that sentiment alive \n\nNo \n\n",
        "Um \nI do think that gay marriage should be allowed in the U.S. \nEspecially since we’re supposed to be considered a free country \nUm \nWhen it comes to living your life \nI think you should be able to do what you want \nIn regards to who you love, I don’t think that it matters whether you’re homosexual, heterosexual, asexual, omnisexual \nDoes that exist?\nI don’t think so \nBut um \nI think that maybe it shouldn’t be called marriage because that’s something that’s reserved for the church but maybe it could be a civil union \nI think that they deserve to have the same rights that a heterosexual couple has when it comes to health insurance, death benefits \nIf they’re living together, if they’re having the same kind of relationship that a heterosexual couple would have \nThere’s no reason for them not to be \nHave that legal piece of paper that says that these two people have uh \nPromised themselves to each other and they are together \nAnd they can share the same benefits that a spouse does \nYeah \nUm \nIt seems to me that people are people, right?\nSo what does it make a difference if the person you’re attracted to either physically or emotionally is the same sex as you or a different sex \nIt doesn’t make a difference \nIt shouldn’t anyway \nBecause at the end of the day, it’s just who you love \nAnd everyone loves in the same way \nUm \nI mean \nAnd if you want to be completely honest \nThey deserve to suffer just as much as every other heterosexual couple that gets married and \nYou know \nBall and chain etcetera, etcetera \nAnd if \nI mean a lot of people also say that well \nThe reason people get married is to have a family \nThen Ok \nThen people who are heterosexual and don’t want to have children should not be allowed to get married either \nYou have to \nYou can’t treat them different just because they are different \nUh \nSexual orientation \nIt just doesn’t make sense \nIt’s a logical \nAccording to the logic that runs our country \nUm \nFrankly I think that there is no reason for the federal government to be involved and \nA-choo!\nSorry.\nUm \nAnd the fact that President Bush is \nUm \nTrying to put a constitutional ban on it bothers me on so many levels \nPartially because part of the reason he’s trying to ban it is because it’s not in the Bible and there should be a difference between church and state \nUm \nThere’s a very big difference between church and state \nThey shouldn’t be involved with each other \nAnd it also feels like he’s trying to push his personal views on the country as a whole \nWhich isn’t right \nUm \nA person shouldn’t be penalized for loving someone \nIf that makes sense \nIt’s one of those things where how can you tell someone that they’re wrong for wanting to be in a relationship with someone and wanting to share their lives with someone else?\nMmhmm \nUm \nFederal government basically has no right to tell \nI mean the state government really shouldn’t either \nUnless they’re gonna put the same kinds of bans on heterosexual couples like if you’re not gonna have children you can’t be married or if you’ve only been together a certain amount of time \nI’ve heard that argument as well \nThat homosexual couples don’t stay together as long as heterosexual couples \nWell the divorce rate among heterosexual couples is fifty percent \nIt’s one out of every two marriages \nEnds in divorce \nSo that argument is kinda out the window at this point \nUm \nYou’d have to put the same limitations on everybody that you’re putting on these people \nBecause they are like I said \nNo different than anybody else \nIt’s just in choosing who they’re going to love \nAnd it’s not even choosing \nBecause you love \nYour heart tells you what to do whether your head likes it or not \nUm \nNo \nI think just in general that they should be allowed to enjoy their lives and be together and suffer just as much as the rest of us \n\n",
        "Ok\nGender discrimination\nUm\nWell I remember when\nWhen I was younger and \nMy\nUm\nYou know people always ask kids who they want to be when they grow up \nI remember my dad would always tell me\nDon’t don’t be an engineer \nBecause there’s so few women engineers\nAnd even if you were in higher ranking positions of authority \n\nAnd so \nAnd so that makes me think that\nWell that and among other things that gender discrimination is still a problem in\nIn the country today\nAnd \nAnd I think I believe\nI think I’ve read statistics where women’s salaries are still not equal to men’s salaries for the same positions \nAnd \nUm\nAnd uh and\nAlso there a lot of fields were \nYes men \nAre are are \nUh\nDominating \nLike like engineering\n\nAnd so but\nAnd then\nSo there’s so there’s gender discrimination against women I still feel today \nBut then\nI actually also believe that there’s \nBecause for so long we’ve been fighting for equal equal rights for women that there’s \nKind of been a backlash against \nAgainst men\nAnd so\nUr\nI was I was reading \nI was reading this \nI read some articles about education \nAnd it seems like we’ll saying in the in the past a lot of times boys were favored over girls in the in the classroom\nBoys were called on more \nGirls\nUh\nBoys were \nUm \nWhen they were right were reinforced more \nAnd er \nOr when \nUm\nOr when the girls were wrong it was immediately was \nO its ok\nBecause you don’t have to be as smart as the boys\nBut that\nToday there \nUm\nToday \nGirls are more focused on in education and given more attention and that classes are geared more towards girls and their style and the style of learning that they respond to best \n\nWhich I though was really interesting \nAnd with\nAnd with \nUm\nAnd I and and I think back to my own experience going through school \nAnd I think that it was girls who were at the near the top of the classes\nI mean I’m going back to like grade school\nAnd the boys were the goof balls or or \nUm\nOr belittled sometimes by the by the teachers \nUh\nAnd\nAnd um \nAnd so I think that\nAnd so \nSo there \nAnd then even once you get into higher education mostly the national average for college is \nEspecially at this college \nEspecially there’s \nIt’s 60% women and 40% men \n\nAnd so more \nMore women are going to college and receiving higher education then then men these days \nAnd so \nOh so \nAnd so there’s some gender discrimination there and I guess what’s needed is more \nIs just an awareness by teachers especially from a young younger age of how there conducting their classes and making sure that they’re giving an equal opportunity to everyone and that they’re encouraging everyone \nEqually \n\nAnd \nAnd then as well as \nAs well as through high school too \nAnd then \nAnd then going back to the workforce and gender discrimination against women \nUm \nWell I guess it’s it’s also a case of encouraging women like throughout higher education to to explore areas typically identified with men such as science or engineering or things like that \nAnd then \nAnd then there’s \nI don’t know there’s just a need for \nHow how do you get people to \nUm \nUh \nTo just \nUm \nRes \nHold on \nWhat was I going to say \nI mean it’s hard because you’re just you’re just always you’re always gonna have \nPeople always have biases and so so \nAnd sometimes it’s just hard \nYou don’t really know how you’re going to get them to understand that their biases are unmerited and \nBut I’m trying to think if there’s any other areas of gender discrimination \n\nUm \nActually we were talking about this in my \nIn one of my classes the other day \nWe were talking about the media and \nUm \nAnd popular culture and someone brought up the point that they feel that men are are \nWell they’re kinda discriminated against in a sense that they’re portrayed only a certain way on many popular television shows that is as as kind of  the goofball and the idiot and the stupid or the stupid husband who always has that um \nThe women always has to keep in check and \n\nAnd and which kind of goes back to the way that I think that more boys are behaving when they’re younger \nThroughout grade school \nUm \nAnd so \nSo I think there’s a discrimination in the \nIn the images presented by the media but then there’s also discrimination presented in \nOr apparent in the \nIn images of women in the media \nUm \nI mean if you’re \nThat women should be \nLook a certain way and \nUm \nLike \nAnd \nUm \nI guess one example would be like everyone you see \nYou see models everywhere and and all these images who are not representative of the average women so you you kinda get a a biased that this should be what women look like when it’s really not true \nIt’s really not representative of the \nRepresentative of the normal average women \nUm \nI’m trying to think if \nLet’s see \nDiscrimination of men in the workplace \nUm \nI still think that men hold the upper hand in a lot in a lot of the \nUm \nIn a lot of careers I think \n\nAnd then its still women who are who are at a disadvantage \nBut \n\nYeah \nI’m trying \nYeah I know \nI’m trying to think cause I \nProbably a generalization that I not informed enough or qualified enough to make but from \n\nYeah \nFrom \nUm \nWell engineering definitely \nUm \nI wonder I wonder what it’s like in the military for women \nThere’s a \nThere’s a \nOne of the girls from my graduating high school class went to West Point \nShe’s at West Point \n\nYeah so \nI wonder what that’s like \n\nLike I would have to imagine that there’s probably some sort of bias or discrimination considering just the small amount of women that are \n\nThat are in that \nUm \nThat field that career \nUm \nAnd other careers \nUm \nHmm \n\nUm \nLet’s see \nI don’t think I can think of anything else \n\nOk \n\n",

        "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
        "Yes I believe it does because I feel like the Catholic Church is so rule oriented \nI feel like as I become \nUm more like a \nLike as I become able to understand really the Catholic religion and stuff I feel like they don’t \nThey’re so rule oriented and they’re so stuck on how everyone else lives their life \nLike why can’t they just teach about Jesus, teach about his role \nAnd teach about like how we can put Him into our lives instead of \nYou know \nTelling us what’s good and what we can and cannot do and stuff like that \nLike where \nLike how do they know really \nI mean maybe it’s just cause I know as a priest and as a deacon or whoever \nHowever you want to call it \nLike they believe that God \nYou know \nSends his word through them and they speak it to the people \nI understand that \nBut like \nI just \nI don’t have faith in that \nI don’t believe that because they’re as human as me \nAs I am \nAnd so like I don’t believe \nThat’s why I can’t like go to church and go to like you know all this other Catholic stuff because like I feel like \nI can’t believe someone else \nLike I believe that the only person who I can believe is me and God \nLike when me \nLike when I sit down and pray \nLike that’s how I believe in God will speak to me like directly \nLike I feel like I can’t believe what someone else says because they’re as human as I am \nSo how do they really know what God’s saying \nSo \nI feel like they need to change their ways to adapt \nTo I mean like I want them to change their ways \nLike stuff about the whole marriage thing and stuff like that \nMaybe that will stop all the \nUm \nPedophiles and stuff \nBut then if they change that \nThen they’d just be like everyone else \nYou know \nAnd so I feel like stuff like that about the whole marriage thing \nI think they should keep it the way they are but be more careful about it and be more strict about it and like have a closer watch on them because of the past that they do have \nBut and I feel like more so they should change their ways to be more accepting \nLike people shouldn’t look at the Catholic Church and think oh God like if I look at a Catholic person they have all these rules and they can’t \nThey don’t accept anybody unless they’re the way that like they are \nAnd I think like they should change their rules and become more accepting and become more tolerant of other people and the way that people lived their lives because \nAnd my thing is I’m going off like the whole homosexual thing because that’s the most \nThat’s like the most prominent thing that everyone keeps talking about \nAbout the whole Catholic Church thing is just that they are so against it \nI mean cause yeah it does say it \nLike in the Bible \nYou know \nNo homosexuality \nBut what were \nWhat were they really talking about? \nAnd so like \nI guess that’s why I can’t believe like half the stuff that they’re saying because like how do you know what the people that wrote the Bible were even saying because the Bible is such like this metaphorical like literature \nLike how do you know that they were saying directly no to homosexuality \nYou know \nLike what were they really talking about? \nAnd so I feel like they \nUm \n Like I feel like the Catholic Church is just trying to look at life and look at the world as being black and white \nThat there is not like gray area \nAnd I feel like with \nUm \nMy understanding of the Bible and with what I’ve come to learn through my theology class that I’m taking now \nIt’s like the Bible is just a guideline and there’s so many different ways to look at it that you can’t look at the Bible in a black and white way and it’s like even though \nLike you \nLike you want to read the Bible \nYou want to see all these different things that it’s saying \nIt says this and it says not to do this \nBut that was at that time \nAnd like you can look at the Bible like at different times in your life \nAnd it could mean different things \nLike you can look at the same passage at different times in your life and it’ll mean different things every time you read it cause you’ll be at a different point in your life \nSo I feel like you can’t \nLike they need to change the rules to accommodate so that \nAnd to accommodate for the fact that the Bible isn’t just saying one thing \nHmm \nI like that \nWait what you said \nI think they could \nUm \nLet’s see \nI feel like \nI like the way \nLike the way that they are like they don’t have their own rule \nJust because it’ll set them apart \nBut I don’t really know \nI mean I think like \nI’m kinda back and forth because at one point I did believe that they should change their rules so that they could \nUm \nLike allow for priests to get married and allow female priests into the like their \nI don’t know \nTheir other sector I guess you could call it \nBut it’s like then I’m still thinking about the fact that they wouldn’t be \nLike who the Catholic religion is \nSo I feel like if they had like a stronger \nUm \nI don’t know if it’s really a stronger way of looking at a \nKeeping watch over it \nThen more so \nThen maybe not everyone that wanted to be a priest should have been a priest \nNot because I feel like the Catholic Church is really, really right now looking for priests because a lot of them are getting old \nA lot of them are dying and stuff \nSo they’re really looking for priests so they just take whatever that comes \nAnd not everyone is really supposed to be because I feel like being chaste is more of like a \nOr being celibate is more of a spiritual thing and you have to be really connected with God in order to really be celibate because it’s so hard and because you have like all these urges to be with someone \nYou have all those sexual urges and stuff so I feel like not everyone that was probably \nLike the people that were pedophiles \nMaybe they weren’t supposed to be priests \nSo \nI feel like if maybe the Catholic Church probably didn’t have such an urgency for priests and they weren’t just picking up anyone that says yeah maybe I want to be a priest and then they turn him into a priest \nIf they weren’t just picking up anyone \nThen maybe like they would have people that really and truly want to be a priest and would really have a connection with God so that even when the sexual urges come they’ll be Ok \nThey’ll be like sexual urges are coming, I’ll go pray and then it’s gone \nSo maybe like they just \nMaybe they should just screen who are priests so they can you know not commit those things \nNo \n\n",

        "Um \nI believe that the side that is wrong is those who are opposed to it \n\nI think it is anybody’s right to conduct themselves in whatever relationship they want to \nI mean this is a country born on democracy and liberty and freedom \nAnd \nI think people should have that sort of choice \nAnd \nThe states that maybe are trying to ban \nUm \nGay marriage or make it not legal are somehow mixing government politics with religion \n\nWhich is \nI feel is completely wrong \nAnd \nUnjustified especially in this country where you have so many different religions represented in the United States it’s pretty hard to choose one such as Christianity \nAnd \nPick a fundamental belief \nAnd \nBase political law off of it so \nI think just it’s wrong in that sense if they were mixing politics and religion \nAnd \nEven if it’s not a matter of religion they’re just doing it out of what they think is some moral law I still think that’s completely wrong \nBecause \nWho’s to say that they’re relationship is any different \nOr \nAny more wrong than anybody else’s \nUm \nAdditionally I think there’s been scientific studies conducted in recent years \nIf you are homosexual you’re actually born with that tendency \nIt’s part of your DNA or genealogical structure so \nAgain to create something \nTo make something illegal that is so natural of humans seems wrong \n\nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved in it \nAgain because I think it’s not so much not so much something that should be protected by law \nBut \nMore individual choice and liberty \nI think if a government were to get into it only for the purpose of legalizing it and stating that it is such it should be the state government \nSomething if the federal government were to get involved in it it’s something much more final \nEspecially when it’s an amendment in the constitution \nAnd \nI think that would demoralize everything the constitution stood for because that’s been a pretty good basis lasting two hundred almost coming up on three hundred years \nAnd \nIt would just demoralize everything it stood for \n\nAbout how it would demoralize the constitution \n\nUm \nI mean ‘cause it seems as though everything else in the constitution has stood up for this long and it’s been well respected \nAnd \nCopied for copied and looked up upon several different cultures around the world \nSo \nTo introduce something like that where it’s not so much protecting the society as more infringing upon individual rights \nAnd \nTheir relationships I think it will just \nIt will really stick out in the constitution as being something that’s not very lawful \nAnd \nCertainly be debated for years to come whereas the rest has been pretty much set in stone and accepted our society accepts it as lawful \n\nYeah I mean I think gay marriage and going into families with homosexual parents \nI mean again who’s to say that they are any more or less loving of their children \nWho’s to say \nI mean just ‘cause the physical make up of their family is any different doesn’t mean that they’re children or society should look at that family any different \nThey can still grow up and grow as a family with the same values \nAnd \nI mean \nA relationship is \nEspecially something like marriage or courtship is based on love and how you feel about somebody else \nSo \nTo you know try and put law on a relationship and say that you can’t \nThere are restrictions on how you your natural instincts and how you should feel about somebody else \nI just think that’s completely wrong \n\nUm \nI think that’s it \n\n",
        "Um \nLet’s see I do feel it is somewhat there \nOr \nIt actually definitely is there \nUm \nI know a lot of people joke around with the issue \nUm \nLike oh make me a sandwich or something of that sort \nUm \nObviously against women right there \nUm \nBut \nNow if you look at my personal life \nI \nUm \nI’m a secretary for a real estate company \nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not your \nUh \nStereotypical eighteen year old male job right there \n\nUm \nLet’s see \nUh \nYou know \nLike \nIf \nI mean I’m sometimes embarrassed even to say that \nYou know \nI like to \nUm \nI actually come out first sometimes saying \nYou know \nOh I’m desk management as a joke \nBut \nThen I say I’m a secretary \nUm \nBut \nYou know \nThe stereotypical secretary is going to be a female \nUm \nYou know \nAge doesn’t matter \nI work \nWell I mainly work with all females \nUm \nUh \nWell definitely all the other secretaries are female \nUm \nAnd \nI know when I was \nUm \nWhen I first applied and first was hired \nUm \nAll the agents from the real estate company came down and was like oh it’s awesome to have a male down here finally \nUm \nAnd \nIt’s \nYou know \nIt all really comes down to stereotypes \nUm \nA stereo\nLike a stereotypical secretary could definitely multitask \nUm \nStereotypical male can’t multitask \nUm \nI don’t know that’s just something I’ve always \nYou know \nGrown up hearing \nUm \nNow if you look at \nUm \nThe stereotypical job for a male versus stereotypical job for a female \nUm \nThe male would definitely be a like construction worker \nOr \nSomething of the sort \nUh \nFemale could be a secretary or I guess a housewife \nUm \nLet’s see \nAnd \nNow if you have like \nIf you have a job \nOr \nUm \nAn example of a man being a stay at home dad \nThat’s definitely not \nUh \nWhat people expect \nUm \nYou could always relate that back to \nUh \nFull House or something like that with Danny Tanner \nCan’t believe I know that name but \nUm \nYeah \nUm \nYou know \nThat’s not your stereotypical thing \nBut \nIt’s a sitcom I guess \nSo \nAnything’s \nYou know \nI don’t know \nI don’t know where I’m going with that \nBut \nUm \nYou know \nUh \nYou do not expect \nUm \nI guess people to shift between \nUm \nSpecific gender jobs \nUm \nYou know \nA nurse is generally a female \nUm \nBut nowadays it’s starting to come out \nUm \nI know \nI know somebody who was a male nurse \nAnd \nUm \nI guess Ben Stiller in one of \nI think it’s like Meet the Parents \n\nUm \nIs a nurse as well \nSo \nAnd \nThey joke about that \nUm \nSaying oh you’re a doctor \nNo actually I’m a nurse \nUm \nI know that was kinda funny \nBecause \nMost people don’t expect a male to be a nurse \nUm \nSo \nI feel as though the gender discrimination all comes down to stereotypes \nUm \nAnd \n\nWell \nUm \nI had actually \nUm \nWe \nThis had \nUh \nCame up in my FE100 class \nUm \nEarlier on this year \nAnd \nI actually think \nUm \nGender is really something that you’re raised upon \nUm \nAt a certain age \nUm \nLike \nToys \nLike \nUm \nBaby toys \nUh \nCan generally go \nUm \nEither way unless they’re pink or blue \nBut \nI guess that’s really where \nUm \nYou know \nBoys start to know what boys are \nAnd \nGirls start to know what girls are \nAnd \nWhat they like \nUh \nThat’s when everything a boy buys is gonna be blue everything a girl buys is gonna be pink \nUm \nLet’s see here \nUm \nWell with that \nLike for instance \nI had talked with one of my professors this year \nOr \nActually a \nUm \nAn administrator here at Loyola \nAnd \nHe said it was about \nOr \nOne of his daughters likes Thomas the train \nOr \nWhatever that thing is called \n\nAnd \nUm \nHe just can’t buy anything for that \nBecause \nShe’s a girl \nUm \nSo \nHe said he had to end up buying boy whitey tightys for her to wear \nBecause \nShe liked \nYou know \nThomas the train so much \nUm \nSo it starts to come I guess with the industries nowadays in the US \nUm \nPeople are brought up upon \nUh \nKnowing what gender is \nUh \nIt’s just how they’re raised \nUm \nGirls are supposed to like this \nGirls are supposed to play with dolls \nGirls are supposed to have makeup \nUm \nAnd \nThen \nYou know \nGuys \nYou know \nGuys need GI Joes \nAnd \nToy guns \nAnd \nStuff \nAnd \nI guess \nUh \nThe companies nowadays in the US \nAnd \nActually the world \nUh \nAll just kind of produce that for aiming at specific ages \nAnd \nI guess because of this \nUm \nThey all just \nUm \nThey kind of form opinions for the kids \nAnd \nDon’t really give them a chance to express themselves \nUm \nIn ways that they want \nI had also talked with my RA \nAnd \nUm \nHe is a male obviously \nBut \nHe is a feminine male I guess you could say \nUm \nThat’s simply because he spent a lot of time with his mom growing up \nSo \nUm \nI guess \nUm \nYou know \nHe is definitely not your stereotypical male \nBut \nYou know \nHe’s still a male nonetheless \nSo \nUm \nHmm \n\nUm \nMen and women are \nI feel as though \nUm \nThat is definitely the case \nUm \nI know with me being a secretary \nI know I take some um \nI take some jokes \nYou know I’m not gonna lie \nBut \nUm \nI also make those jokes \nUm \nYou know \nI don’t feel as though there’s anything wrong with me being a secretary or anything \nUm \nIt gets me money that’s all I care about \nBut \nUm \nLet me see here it’s \nThere’s definitely \nLike if there was a woman construction worker \nUm \nI could bet you a lot of people will \nYou know \nSay oh what is she doing working there \nYou know \nShe \nBecause \nIf you look at \nUm \nThe \nUh \nStereo \nAgain stereotypical male stereotypical female \nUh \nThe female would be weak \nAnd \nThe male would be like very strong \nUm \nI believe a term I’ve heard \nUm \nEarlier this year was like alpha hegemonic male or something like that \nUm \nIt’s basically like \nYou know \nI’m very strong I’m buff I do everything type of male \nUh \nAnd \nWomen are generally known \nUm \nIn the stereotypical sense to be I guess \nUm \nHelpless or something like that \nNot that I’m saying that that’s the case \nI’m just saying that that’s stereotypically the case \nUm \nThey’re just more of a caring \nUm \nCaring gender with the whole motherly issue \nUm \nAnd \nI feel as though \nI guess the body’s natural ways also influences the \nUm \nThe ways people think about \nUh \nWomen and men \nUh \nRelated \nUh \nObviously with the women having the children \nYou know \nThey have the motherly sense \nAnd \nMen having more muscle naturally \nUm \nThey would be able to have different jobs \nUm \nAnd \nI don’t know I think it all really also refers to the natural \nUm \nMale and female bodies as well as far off as that may seem \nBut \nUm \nI think that’s about it \n\nUh \nNo that’s it \n\n",

        "I think gender discrimination is still an issue \nBut \nIt will never be an issue \nIt will never not be an issue until little girls stop playing with Barbies \nAnd \nLittle boy stop playing with Tonka trucks \n\nBecause \nDifferences start so early on \nAnd \nLike \nEven in the way we treat our children like as babies \nPeople say different things to baby boys and baby girls that give them expectations of themselves \nAnd \nIt just pervades society those expectations that boys need to be strong \nAnd \nGirls are sweet and caring \nAnd \nThat carries over into the work place \nAnd \nWell I guess it’s just stereotyping basically \nIt’s kind of a psychological thing I think where unless people think of boys and girls the exact same way since like the day they’re born then I can’t see it ever stopping \nI know there’s a big movement for people to respect the different roles of boys and girls \nAnd \nLike value them equally \nUm \nBut \nDoes that mean it’s still discrimination \n‘Cause \nMen and women are always going to be different \nThere’s just inherent differences \nNot just physical but mental too \nIn the way they think \nAnd \nBrain activity \nAnd \nYou know \nShould men and women be treated exactly the same \nI know in the workplace is a different story \nLike with pay and things like that that \nUm \nThere’s no reason that men shouldn’t be paid the same amount as a woman \nBut \nDoes it happen all the time \nProbably not \nI mean there’s not just like pay and hiring discrimination \nThere’s certain things like \nUm \nSexual harassment in the workplace \nHow often does that happen to men \nIt’s like \nAnd \nIf it did what would we do about it \nWe’d laugh \nSay wow you don’t like that \n\nSo \nThere is discrimination in many many forms \n\nTo change the discrimination \nUm \nWell \nI’m really just not sure what to do about things like hiring and pay discrimination \nBecause \nWe had affirmative action for that \nAnd \nI’m not sure how well that turned out \nBecause \nIt created a lot of bitterness I know in some people that I know even like applying for college \nUm \nThat a women would be accepted before \nA middle class white

\nIt’s not just that \nIt starts there \nIt starts when you’re a child \nAnd \nThe way you think of girls \nAnd \nStuff like that \nAnd \nI’m sure boys who have been raised in different kinds of homes will be more likely to hire a woman respect her give her a fair wage \nAnd \nStuff like that as opposed to others \nAlso on your way up \nOn your way growing up and on your way up in the corporate chain you run into lots of different things that can change your perception \nAnd \nTo get society to change is hard \nBut \nIt’s happening \nIt just has to happen where all of a sudden it’s just so looked down upon to talk about a woman in a negative manner \nOr \nTo laugh about haha I’m getting more than this woman who works the same job as me \nAnd \nIt just has to get to the point \nAnd \nIt is it is \nBecause \nOf like media publicity \nAnd \nSo many women speakers who have taken it on themselves to like push the issue that people look on it like racism \nLike when someone makes a racist comment everyone’s like oh my god I don’t believe you just said that \nWhat’s wrong with you \n\nIt’s starting to become like that \nAnd \nI think we just need to keep pushing it and pushing it \nAnd

of companies \nPeople will start to believe it more \nBecause \nIt’s I don’t wanna say it \nBut \nIt’s mostly about like exposure \nAnd \nAdvertising \nAnd \nHow much you can get a certain message out there \nBecause \nPublic opinion is very influential in those kinds of situations \n\nOh I’m sure men are discriminated against like especially when \nUh \nMen take on feminine jobs like nurses \nAnd \nStuff \nBut \nAgain it’s changing \nBecause \nThere’s shows now like I don’t know I think Scrubs \nGrey’s Anatomy probably has male nurses \nER I’m sure does \nUm \nThere’s just a whole bunch of shows like that that have these really cool guys in nurses roles and stuff that make it OK \nAnd \nPeople are like hey that’s cool I like that actor I like that guy I like his role \nAnd \nJust the more you see of it \nIt’s harder when you’re the one guy who’s there with like a bunch of women \nAnd \nThey’re all sitting at their lunch table \nAnd \nThey’re all giggling and laughing \nAnd \nThat

        "Do I think what? \nUm \nI think it’s an invasion of privacy when the school prowls around \nUm and \nBasically filters through all of its students’ Myspaces \nBut I think that if people see something like that on a student’s Myspace then they have a duty to report it \nAnd once it’s reported, I think it’s certainly not an invasion of privacy for them to look at it \nI mean \nI think that the community should be the eyes and ears cause once the school starts prowling around and all that then they’re gonna see a whole lot of things about the students’ personal lives that \nI mean I guess you could use the whole argument that Myspace is a public domain cause it’s on the internet \nUm \nSo I guess realistically and legally it’s not really an invasion of privacy \nUm \nEspecially because the student has the option on Myspace to make their profile private \nUm \nBut yeah \nWell yeah \nAs far as I know on all of the social networking sites every participant has the option to make their information private \nUm \nI mean cause the internet is the public domain so whatever they posted up there \nThey can’t really call it an invasion of privacy if someone then goes and looks at it \nUm \nI think the invasion of privacy would just be more of a thing that people might complain about if the school was to go prowling around on their Myspace \nCause a lot of people put up like all sorts of poetry and things like that that they consider to be kinda personal \nBut it is kind of a flip flop thing to consider something to be really personal when it’s posted on your Myspace because Myspace is a public domain \nSo I mean the school isn’t really in the wrong to go prowling around cause they have kind of a compelling interest for students’ safety \nBut um I mean \nI think that if people see those kinds of things then they should report them and then the school should look at it \nUh \nYou know to tell you the truth I think there’s a lot of deference to the school district on that matter \nUm \nBecause you know as much as it’s not really \nYou know \nOverly respectful of students’ privacy for the school to \nUh \nTo go prowling around you know I \nI can’t really bring myself to say that the school would be legally in the wrong for prowling around \nEspecially if the student didn’t make their profile public \nSo I guess the school has the right to do what it wants \nUm \nBut I know that Loyola for instance doesn’t go prowling around on \nUh \nThe Facebook \nReason being that when \nI mean the people who do judicial student life \nWhenever they witness something that’s wrong \nUh \nOne of the duties of their job is they are compelled to report it or to document it \nUm \nAnd they have to or else they lose their jobs \nAnd uh \nSo if they go around on the Facebook they may be looking for one thing \nFor sexual harassment \nAnd then they see a picture of ten kids who are freshman drinking beers \nUm \nSo now they have to write those ten kids up for drinking beers \nAnd so that’s just not something that they want to go into \nIt’s a little bit of a different situation \nBut I mean I think the school pretty much has the right to do what it wants though \nWell yeah \nI mean that’s \nThat’s good that they were able to do that \nUm and \nI mean \nAs much as a lot of people \nI mean it’s legitimate for someone to feel that’s that is an invasion of their privacy \nBut it’s really not legitimized I think with any legal bases because it’s the public domain \nUm \nNo \n\n",

        "Uh \nNo I don’t feel it’s an invasion of privacy because he \nIf he did in fact post a bulletin on Myspace I think he was kind of reaching out for some kind of public notice or trying to notify somebody that he was planning this \nSo if someone were to go and tell the school officials or if the school officials even just found it themselves \nHe obviously put it out there \nHe put it on a public server so he’d \nHe pretty much accepted the consequences the second that he did that \n\nUh \nWell Myspace is a public server and many people can view it if you post a bulletin or anything your friends can view it any \nEven people who aren’t your friends can probably view it so by putting it there he kind of just put it in an open source so it would be like writing on the blackboard \nWriting on a blackboard like in a school somewhere that you were planning it so \nReally by investigating into that situation it wasn’t invading privacy because if there is a threat posted somewhere \nEspecially somewhere in public I think its best to look into it rather then to just pass it off as just someone being \nI don’t know \nSomeone just being really antsy or something \n\nI think that school officials have a tendency to assume different things about people based on their appearance or \nI don’t know anything else just the way they \nLike uh \nWhat kind of music they listen to and all of that stuff \nOr maybe what there interests are \nAnd I think that \nUh \nThis has a big impact \nLike a big \nSchool officials take this way to far sometimes \nThey go \nLike I’ve seen uh \nI \nWhen I was in 9th grade I witnessed an event where one of the students in my school wrote up a hit list of different people in the school \nAnd the thing about the person is he didn’t really have any appearance that would lead people to believe that \nBut I think that school officials do tend to look for like \nI don’t know \nMaybe different trends like Goth \nLike they have those Goth trends \nThe emo trends and all of that \nAnd they kind of look out for that and see that as a sign as a possible school shooting \nAnd when they are to look into someone try to find out more about someone \nUh \nJust based on their appearance \nI think that’s definitely invading their privacy because \nThey have to learn to understand that people are different and people like to express themselves in different ways but just because they’re doing it in a certain way doesn’t mean that they’re planning any threats or anything of that nature \n\nUm \nIn terms of uh the \nSchool officials \nNo not really \nI think that they should try to mind their own business if its not a direct threat or if they don’t have any factual evidence to back it up \nSo \n\nAlright \n\n",

        "Um \nI think the Catholic Church needs to change its ways in order to provide \nUh \nCurrent and effective solutions to social problems \nUh sure \nI mean I think that uh \nOne of the functions of the Catholic Church that has always appealed most to me and one that I always viewed as the most meritous has been \nUh \nThe Catholic Church’s tackling of social problems that states and governments might not have the funds or the personnel \nUh \nTo tackle \nAnd um \nThey did a very good job of that under Pope John Paul II in terms of expanding their scope as an organization \nBut I think that you know the world is changing and there are a lot of \nA lot of ills that are going on in a whole variety of ways and I think that while they could be tackling humanitarian issues in Africa and Latin America \nUm \nI think at least the American Catholic Church in tackling issues like stem cell research and gay marriage is just plain selfish and short-sighted \nAnd they need to kind of change and adapt \nAnd uh \nI mean cause there’s a lot more in the Bible about being good to your brothers and sisters than there is about you know gay marriage and eating shell fish \nSo yeah \nUm \nWell I mean \nI don’t know \nI guess that’s just the same as the kind of division between being liberal in a particular religion and being conservative in a particular religion \nWhether or not you want to try and hang on to the ways of old \nWhether you think it’s ok to \nUh kind of expand or change a little bit \nCause some people \nI mean you know you can read the Bible and interpret in any one of a number of ways \nAnd um \nI mean people then apply their interpretations differently \nI think it’s \nThe most foolish thing to do is to fight over it \nUm \nWhich I see a lot of people doing cause that’s just counterproductive \nUm \nIn terms of specific ways \nUm \nUh \nI took a theology and politics in America course last semester and I really wish I had all of my notes in front of me right now \nUm \nSo I can’t think of any off the top of my head \nThey might come to me in a couple of minutes \nUm \nWell I \nI think there are a whole lot of people who go to church on \nYou know \nOn Sundays \nUm \nAnd then aren’t even really necessarily sure why \nThey just go because they felt like it was the right thing \nThat’s where the whole term cafeteria Catholics comes from \nUm \nAnd I think the Catholic Church might have lost touch with a lot of people in a very real way cause a lot of people in America are struggling over \nYou know \nHow to get enough food and how to pay their rent and for a lot of those people faith is a very strong component in their lives \nBut I mean for a lot of the other people who go to church \nI feel like they’ve kind of lost touch \nUm \nAnd \nI feel like a lot of the kind of stuff that the church does in developing countries \nI mean a lot of the organizations are good just in terms of what they do to alleviate material poverty \nBut a lot of those organizations \nAny of those organizations are only as intact as the actual people that are running them \nAnd I’ve worked for some where they were great and they were really providing sustainable solutions or problems in helping people \nAnd I’ve worked for some where the staff and the personnel of that particular organization was just pocketing things and then saying, oh you should give us money because we’re the church \nAnd then just going and buying cars with it \nSo I think in terms of the Catholic Church’s reach \nYou know \nOutside of the western world or the quote unquote first world or developed whatever \nUm \nI think that they could maybe clean it up a little bit \nBut the fact that they’re there and no one else is in a lot of places is good though \nI \nI \nI think a lot of those things \nI mean I’m not a psychology expert \nBut I think that a lot of those things \nMaybe if they would have not happened all together would have happened a lot less frequently if you were to allow people to kind of naturally express their sexual tendencies \nUm \nI mean \nI don’t know \nCelibacy is certainly not for me \nBut uh \nI mean I don’t know \nMaybe it’s possible that when you ask people to be celibate \nI don’t know it just does something in their mind or something \nUm \nI mean women in the priesthood wouldn’t be a bad a idea \nI mean a lot of other faiths have no problem with it \nAnd um \nNone of them have really been smitten to hell \nSo I guess it’s all about how concrete people are about their particular beliefs \nAnd what they are \nOn which part of the answer?

        "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
        "Um I don't think it's Isn't there a second part of the question too about the priest's scandal, the sexual abuse scandal?\n\nOk Well I was gonna say\n\nYeah, yeah I know, but they kinda coincide for me I mean with the catholic church I don't think there's anything so outdated where like alright let's see [inaudible] like we need to turn the catholic church up on it's ears and completely reform it But, um Cause some of the stuff with like the priests and the sexual abuse scandal I mean priests went centuries without feeling the need to do that. \n\nI mean there's always the conspiracy that but I mean it's gotten along for two millennia just fine, so I don't think and I mean there was the second Vatican, in the 60's?\n\nI don't know something like that but I mean I don't think that there's so much wrong in the catholic church right now that it needs to be updated, but if it did at any point become obvious that it needs to be updated I would be all for it I mean I think it could be updated now, but there's no pressing there's no real necessity to it at this point.\n\nWhat's the exact wording of the question again?\n\nChange it's ways I think is the key phrase I mean that's not I wouldn't say like maybe they could change one idea but I still don't think even if they did like the gay marriage they said like alright I still don't think besides the obvious like functionality of the sense of like marriage and stuff I don't think they would need to change like the fundamental way they work.\n\nCan you Can you expand on that? Do you mind if the way they practice it?\n\nI think people are so they're so like they misunderstand the catholic church so much that it's, it's a crime and like I do, I, I am not like a strong catholic at all I mean I consider myself a catholic like I disagree and I believe what I want to it just happens, it just happens that I follow the catholic church more closely than most.\n\nWell no I mean I was raised like my dad's really but I'm still not like I'm not as religious as my dad but um I just think as a whole I mean there's so many that call themselves catholic and um have nothing to do with it. I don't know it's just a shame the way it's construed.\n\nI mean there's a certain level of\n\nYeah, I know. Like there's a certain level of like participation and like yeah a certain sense of like community that you need to participate in I mean you can't just call yourself a catholic and be like oh yeah I mean I went to church like last Easter\n\nYeah \n\nYeah.\n\nBut, I'm, I'm just sayin'\n\n[S18} Yeah I mean I don't go to church every week\n\nBut, but I think I try to live as a catholic I mean I don't think I could I go to church  I think I'd have to go to confession once or go to confession a couple of times before I could receive again Yeah.\n\nNot if you have a mortal sin.\n\nYeah, but like yeah there's, there's like some couple one thing um me and this friend worked with this one kid like really Muslim like really into the Muslim I mean I don't know he was like this regular guy just happened to be really into Islam so we were talking to him and he thought uh he didn't know and we went and we back into work and asked a bunch of people if they knew this and no one did that Catholics believe that if you're catholic, if you're a Jew, if you're a Muslim, you can all get into heaven that is true\n\nNo, you're uh Christian\n\nOh Christians sorry you're damned to hell no\n\nChristian, Jew right?\n\nI'm pretty sure right?\n\nNo I,I,I was almost positive\n\nNo, no they aren't exactly\n\nYeah, well it is. \n.\nYeah well I grew up with that but\n\nWell we said pray is like [inaudible] but it's not like you're gonna go to hell it's not like that literal fear instilled in you I mean there's fear of God in that sense but not that literal fear I think you're referring to as in the old days.\n\nYeah well purgatory but um yeah but if you talk to like a catholic and you talk to a muslim they will have more of their beliefs in common than a catholic and a fundamentalist Christian that is true.\n\nNo, no, no I mean some of these fundamentalist Christians I mean between that and like \n\nFundamentalist Christian? Like um\nNo, no, these people are not Catholics. I don't um\n\nNo they don't claim to be Catholic at all but um um I'm not trying to offend anyone here\n\nWell no but\n\nI'm trying to like define it more.\n\nThat guy's awesome.  I don't care he's like going to hell but that guy's crazy he smacked an old woman in the head did you see that one?\n\nHe's like one of those faith healers that they televise he's like give me your money and I will free you of your sins there's an old woman who's like crippled and he like smacked her in the face\n\nWe're kinda getting' off topic but like people who I wish I woulda prepared my views usually I'm\n\nNo, they can pick on us let them pick on us\n\nNo cause if they keep pickin on us I mean they're gonna keep pickin on us and eventually they're gonna get something wrong and they're gonna misunderstand something and we can say well I mean I pick on the catholic church\n\nExactly I mean like \n\nI know but I\n\nYou go for the recruitment of female priests and allow priests to marry?\n\nYeah, I think that um\n\nI would actually say that the female priests I see that as the closest thing that's gonna come to a head first in reforming the catholic church I mean cause it's gonna be like a functional thing I mean what are you gonna have I mean people joining seminaries is down I mean it just doesn't make sense in my opinion to not let females be priests.\n\nWell then again you're talking about the catholic church you're not talking about the catholic church in the United States\n\nThat's a big point we just, we just kinda overlooked throughout this whole\n\nThere's, there's my favorite story my best friend is Polish his cousin is Polish he's afraid to tell his mom about his best friend because he's a Jew he lives in Poland his cousin is 31 years old it's like that embedded in other cultures I mean we're kinda liberal we're very liberal compared to other countries I mean there's like Poland Roman Catholic just like I don't know\nWhat do you mean all of our ways?\n\nYeah or I mean we can't have like a United States coup of the Catholic Church\n\nExactly. Cause like over here its like yeah why not over in Europe I mean who knows its like what?! \n\nI don't understand it's like\n\nOh. Disallowing women is like whatever?\n\nIt'd be weird first I mean I admit it going to church and seeing a girl priest it's be like woah\n\nWow in the words of flava flave\n\nGender discrimination\n\nWell who knew we were gonna have the priests facing us when they were saying mass? Who knew we were gonna have mass spoken in English? I mean just go back a hundred years.\n \nWell I'm just saying a hundred years cause we couldn't pinpoint it earlier. So I'm just saying a hundred years.\n\nIt was like oh this is what this part means\n\nYeah exactly\n\nThat's not even that's not even like an issue right now that's not even like on the table for discussion it's just like ah nope not gonna happen no way no how I'm not saying that's the way it should be but\n\nThat was the culture back then.\n\nWell it was just like back then it just wouldn't have made sense for a woman to be a priest like what?\n\nOoo. Whippin out the primary source.\n\nAgreed.\n \nWell yeah, you could use the Bible to argue any point anyways just like God said so!\n\nAnd no one knows how many authors there are.\n\nI don't I don't know about that there is some dividing line here I don't know how think it is, between saying wow that women's beautiful and wow that 12 year old boy's beautiful I mean you gotta have something predisposed up in your head to find\n\nUh yeah it's a pretty thick line yeah but I think there's gotta be something else I mean I don't know\n\nYeah. Exactly I mean that's the point that I'm tryin to make.\n\nUh yeah I would imagine unmarried as well.\n\nSelf-control there's the overwhelming majority of catholic priests well who knows overwhelming but there is catholic priests who find it perfectly easy to go throughout the day and not destroy and not destroy some 12 year old boy's psyche I mean like it is possible these, these priests should be like tortured.\n\nTo become a priest?\n\nSo you're saying it can't exist without him being messed up and it can exist without the church?\n\nThat's what you said?\n\nWell that's what you said. Is that what you meant?\n\nThis is great terminology we're using here there has to be a predisposition to\n\nSo you're sayin it a crapshoot, right?\n\nBut that means you're predisposed means that somewhere in your lineage the male was a priest correct?\n\nI see I was saying there's something, something, another piece to the puzzle\n\nWait psychological evaluations?\n\nI think there should be real evaluations cause I don't think Is there any real evaluation process right now? Yeah I don't think\n\nThen again, I believe that people should have like psych like driver's license tests every year so maybe I'm skewed towards that would suck\n\nI just bought that up cause maybe that skews my opinion\n\nOf course it's always a good thing.\n\nMaking it better,stronger, faster\n\nPeople sharing priests sharing churches\n\nExactly one of the whole keys to symbolism there is you're supposed to be married to the church so I mean I think what would in a way if you're thinking about it you'd probably allow female priests before you'd allow priests to marry\n\nIt could be one big threesome of catholic love\n\nI think we'll wrap it up with a threesome of catholic love.\n",
        "Yes\n\nHonestly  I don't really know much about the war  until  like  I  I came to college and  I heard a lot of different discussions about it  and  it's actually  like  [inaudible]  just to think about it  it's not even a war  cause it never was declared a war  so  it's just  and I don't really like the fact of  the  um  at first  like when September 11th happened I was like  go over there  ya know  raise all kinds of hell  because  ya know  they did this to all of our people and at really innocent people  and I have family in New York and that was something that was real  ya know  like  [inaudible] about  but  it's just  I kind of feel like  America thinks that we're so big and bad that we need to go over there and try and change Iraq to  meet  to fit our standards  and to  ya know  cause we have democracy  so  they think  well  democracy is the way to go  and  ya know  that's  there's institutions over there that have been established before we even got over there  so  it's kind of wrong for them to just come over there and just start taking over stuff\n\nYea\n\nI feel like that's true though  because  I feel like afterwards  ya know  after September 11th you saw like  so much  of like the U.S just coming together  there were flags on like overpasses and you really felt like  a sense of community and like  connections with everyone  and they may not have gotten effected by it  but they were like  was just like  ya know  that's my people  that even  I may not know them  but still  what if that coulda been me type of thing\n\nSo  I mean  I feel like  the  the way they did it  because just riling people up gets your support and that's really what he wanted was the support  so I feel like if he got the support then  the rest of the government or whatever  the whole government thing works  would have been like  ok  cause they're feeling the pressure that people are like  let's go  then they're gonna be like  let's go too  but  if they really knew  if a lot of people really knew what it was  they would have probably just been like  ya know what  just leave them alone\n\nYea\n\nYea\n\nYea\n\nI wonder what made this movement  like from Afghanistan to Iraq though\n\nYea\n\nAre you like a politics major or something?\n\nMe neither\n\nDo you have another question?\n\nI  I mean  I'm kind of up in the air with that  because the fact that  they're  they've been over there  like they just  we just caused so much  like  havoc  and chaos over there that  if we left  there'd be so much more \n\nAnd I feel like if we left  there wouldn't be an Iraq \n\nYea  and like  even more of a vendetta  cause like you said  we'd get even more of a vendetta against us  wow  that's scary  um  so  I don't know  I feel like  cause\n\nYea  they need to find the way to finish the job  because  a lot of  I mean  just looking on  in like  the news  and on TV  and in  on  in the newspapers and just seeing like  this young family lost its father and husband  it's just really sad  because as an adult coming up now  I'm just kind of like  I wouldn't want that  but  it's just really sad for them because they're losing family members over something that's not even really real  like it's not like constitutionally declared  they were just like  let's go\n\nYea \n\nUh-huh\n\nI don't really have much else to say  Sorry\n\nYea  I don't really\n\nYea\n\nI actually realized that when I like thought about  um  like  how women could  just  ya know  women get killed off of real  just real stupid things  I don't even know  like  ya know  if they go off and they have an affair  or  if they just do something  that's not what their husband wants  they can just  get killed  if ya know  if a woman doesn't want to get married when the father wants them to get married  and  goes off and does something else  then  they can get killed for that  but if you really think about it  I was  I was like  I was glad we were going in to turn that way around  but  they're happy like that  which is really odd about  ya know  I really  I found that like really surprising  that they're like  if you see them talking  you're like  we're  you're happy  they're making their own businesses  doing their own thing  they don't mind covering themselves from head to toe  in like 100 degree weather  so\n\nYea  definitely\n\nI think Bush is one of the worst presidents ever  because  I mean  I feel like  like I said before  I feel like the government  should cater to the people  and I'm like  at this point  no one really likes him  I don't even know those  um  those polls  I forgot the names of the polls  the  I don't know\n\nYea  and it's like  he has  like  probably like 20-30 percent  and then the rest is everyone else saying  no  we want him to leave  I feel like  this  the 2008 election's gonna be like huge  because  they're gonna want  we're gonna want someone  cause I'm voting  so I'm so excited about that now  so we're gonna want someone who  is gonna like  make a complete turn around  and  make  not even a complete turn around  but we're gonna want someone that's gonna fix his mess\n\nI'm gonna be freaking excited.\n\nYea  I think we'd really just be going  just to like  gain  ya know  be  like sabotage it  I guess\n\nYea  gain more land  that's what I was trying to say  yea\n\nUh-huh\n\nUm  yea  I do  just like \n\nSorry  a lot of concepts in our world today  I feel like when our generation is gonna be  ya know  when our generation is in power  or our generation is making better  bigger decisions  and  I feel like  a lot of things  like the whole gay marriage is going to be legalized  I feel like  um  Iraq is just  gonna be done  ya know  I feel like a lot of things will  I think in a way  I feel like our generation will make a lot of things a lot easier  ya know []  we'll just be like  oh  ok  I like it\n\nYa know  and we'll just go on with life  and not just be stuck in a rut like  for  I mean  this whole Iraq thing has gone for what  five, six years now  and  it needs to be done  like the news is  the first thing you see on the news is war in Iraq  terrorism, war in Iraq  it's annoying now \n\nThey are  [Inaudible]\n\nI don't know  I'm sorry  []  that's all I got  I don't know if I can say anything else\n\nI feel sorry for Laura  Laurie  Laura? Whatever her name is\n\nThere you go  I feel sorry for her. She's such a sweet lady.\n\nHis wife\n\n[Inaudible] \n\nHe's made a law about that?\n\nI feel like  I don't feel like this  is it called the Patriot Act? Where  he can go  and  if he feels suspicious of anything \n\nHe can go in there and  just  do whatever he wants  and  I feel like it's just giving him a whole load of power \n\nAnd  kinda like too much power over us  and it  ya know  separating the president from normal people type thing  and  that's [Inaudible]\n",
        "Yes\n\nAnd I think it was probably the single worst tactical decision a president in office has made within at least the last 50 years because\n\nI mean from a strategic standpoint if you want to make America safer that's not the way to do it even the CIA published reports saying that the instances and the risk of terrorism in the United States is now much greater than it was before\n\nBecause of the Iraq war because that entire region's been destabilized now because there's no longer any central authority not not to say that Saddam was a good guy but you had Saddam in power that country was stable even even though he was committing atrocities\n\nYea uh-huh\n\nWhich actually made sense\n\nYea\n\nAnd I think our government deliberately gave the American people misinformation leading up to the war even Collin Powell after leaving office has said that he did not trust the information that he was getting about there being WMDs in Iraq at the time\n\nWeapons of mass destruction like nuclear weapons or biologic weapons\n\nYea cause he went before the UN and presented that evidence and he has since said that he did not trust the evidence at the time he did not think it was reliable or entirely accurate\n\nI think that's what happened I didn't I mean you're gonna have a hard time proving that's what happened but \n\nI think that's almost certain\n\nYea\n\nI think they saw I think the Bush Administration came into the office with the intent to go to war in Iraq because they've had a vendetta against Saddam Hussein for a long time there have been U.N. and U.S. sanctions against him for years and years and years and part of the assassination attempt against George Bush Senior was traced back to Iraq. I think they came in with a vendetta I think they intended to go into Iraq and I think part of what they want is to have Iraq destabilized so that they had to use the United States as a crutch because if Iraq has to use the U.S. as a crutch then the U.S. has economic leverage in that country\n\nAnd we can get cheaper oil and I think that's ultimate they wanted economic gains from this as well as kind of a a post [inaudible] imperialism almost\n\nNo I just really don't like George Bush\n\nYea \n\nI think they went in without being adequately prepared to deal with withdrawal \n\nYea Yea\n\nAnd they had it just on a post-it note in Bush's office this is what we're gonna do and I think it it's also become obvious that the cultural gaps between our American culture and the culture that they have in Iraq are so the gulf there is so large that the idea like you were saying the idea that you could come in and establish democracy especially with a group of of Muslims who are used to the government being dictated by religious factions and then coming in trying to institute a secular democracy is just that's like putting oil and water together and expecting them to cook\n\nYea you have to kind of wonder why they the Kurds are the third major ethnicity in Iraq and you have to kind of wonder why they haven't worked on setting up an independent Kurdistan at this point because the Kurds have been fighting for that for years and frankly they're the best self-managed ethnicity in Iraq and the only reason the Kurds haven't split off as an independent country so far is because a lot of the major oil fields in Iraq are on Kurdish land so I think that that right there is very indicative of the fact that a lot of the reasons for what's happened in Iraq so far has been economic\n\nI don't think I think there's a certain amount of arrogance to thinking that you can go into a country and just all of a sudden establish the exact same kind of government that you have because you think it's the [inaudible] model of government now don't get me wrong I like democracy I think it's a pretty good idea but I don't think it's something you can march around forcing other people to do\n\nI think it's a natural process that has to occur over time.\n\nPublic approval rating \n\nI think there will be a bigger push for a phased withdrawal\n\nIf a democrat is elected\n\nNot I'm not sure what the speed will end up being I think there will definitely be more motion towards a withdrawal if a democrat is elected I think there will more emphasis on nation building and on making the Iraqi government stable and right now they're even talking about having a coalition of governments from the surrounding countries come in to rule Iraq because\n\nYea that I mean\n\nYea pretty much\n\nThat's essentially what would happen and that's that's not a great idea either\n\nCause a lot of a lot of those countries are also contain many, many terror cells \n\nUh-huh\n\nGain more land\n\nI think that historically like 50 or 75 years down the road the end result of this might be that George Bush went and destroyed Iraq as a country Iraq is just not going to exist 10 years from now that might end up being the result\n\nLike\n\nUh-huh\n\nYea \n\nUh-huh\n\nChina\n\nUh-huh they make good electronics\n\nThey could do it\n\nUm impeach Bush that's all I got\n\nHe's committed he's committed at least several impeachable offenses by now\n\nHe has two daughters Jenna and something else\n\nNo I don't think it's Laura\n\nUm\n\nI think the other problem with the war is that Bush has established a foreign policy precedent that anytime that the precedent of the preemptive strike that anytime America feels threatened someway we have the right to go into that country and eviscerate it and I think that's an extremely dangerous precedent to set and I think that's what he's done here\n\nNo it's just the idea that like when a President does something that puts the idea out there that the President is capable of doing that \n\nI feel\n\nI think a lot of political scientists talk about in American government you seeing the pendulum of power swing back and forth between the congress and the President for certain periods and it kind of goes back and forth um\n\nUm not now not now that it's funded by the Democrats but I mean just in terms of who really holds the attention holds the bulk of the power in the government they talk about that pendulum of power swinging back and forth and I think we've kind of left a period when congress held the bulk of the power for like the last 15, 20 years and George Bush has worked very hard to expand presidential power during his administration\n\n",
        "I think when it comes to like a legal union absolutely um when it comes to being able to get a spouse's pension being able to get healthcare den-, dent- , dentistry ah sorry dental care etceteras and when it comes to tax issues absolutely, there's no reason that they shouldn't be able to and, when it comes to religious that's a different thing completely, and I don't think it should be brought in although I know it is a lot, especially in our country which is so heavily Christian which you know separation of church and state please um\n\nYes, unfortunately, idealistically idealistically the religion has nothing to do with it this is I mean at a lot of and I know I've heard arguments for it that are that say, oh you know they're more frivolous and their unions are shorter and fifty percent of all marriages end in divorce nowadays so really not a valid argument\n \nAt city hall\n\nDid anyone hear about a meeting at Washington state they wanted to pass they um  the government in the state was saying that the reason that they didn't want gay marriage was because they couldn't have children or they had no intent to have children without artificial insemination so the um GLBT community in the area uh wrote up a bill saying, OK if the heterosexual couple is planning not to have children or cannot have children they can't get married either which, honestly they did it to make a point they didn't do it to get the law passed, but it makes so much sense \n\nCause these arguments that are made against gay marriage\n\nThere isn't. \n\nMy reaction to that? Or just in general?\n\nThey didn't petition, they they just kinda wrote it up and spread it around it never actually went through they were trying to make a point\n\nYeah, I was just gonna say\n\nI mean look at um what his name? from uh \n\nNo, not Matthew Shepherd\n\nYeah, well, exactly the priest who's been going around saying that all the deaths in the Iraq war are because America accepts homosexuals\n\nSame guy who you saw the play uh Laramie Project, right? The signs you know who I'm talking about?\n\nThat's the priest, it's an actual man um I can't remember his name I just read it like three hours ago uh I can't remember his name, but um but cause people that's actually a big mentality in our country though it doesn't seem like it because we are in this urban environment and we are especially in our school there's a huge if not gay, lesbian population it's very accepting here\n\nOr from L.A.\n\nI'm not, two of my gay friends are. But, you're either from the coast, you're not really from \n\nOh, absolutely.\n\nIt just changes from year to year which it is\n\nEither although technically I mean then we have the things called common law marriage should that be applied? Because technically, if a woman and a man live in a house for I think seven years federally, they're married common law marriage is still in effect it's a law that's still on the books\n\nI think it's seven years, it may be more I could be wrong, but I know that if you live in the same house and you're not related you're technically married, and if you split off you separate the assets\n\nI don't even honestly who's Tim Robbins?\n\nUnless it's the speaker \n\nI honestly don't. This is gonna sound really bad I don't watch a lot of movies from this decade I watch old movies, so uh like Humphrey Bogart, Carey Grant I'm great but, I have no idea who that is um but, it's a common law marriage so would that apply like would it apply? Because then I mean obviously if it's homosexual people who are just living together um would it apply would common law marriage things like that apply? \n\nWell, obviously. But, I'm saying, what so you guys think? Like if you think, it works if they'd have to like do you get what I'm saying am I making sense?\n\nSo when does that happen? When does that happen when everybody agrees?\n\nIt's blatant discrimination with a lot of things I mean there's still blatant discrimination with my father's from Germany, right? There's still blatant discrimination against him, we've gone into restaurants and people have wouldn't have talked to him because he's German we've gone to like Gold's Deli I don't know if any of you my Dad has a very thick German accent, so he's gotten it's everywhere it just doesn't it just depends on who the person \n\nI know. Most people who think they're thinking are really just rearranging their prejudices so\n\nWell, there's also the whole thing that if they've now found that what they think is the gay gene do you guys know I didn't get to it I had class, but I've read his rating before. The whole problem with that is every single church in existence is going to have to completely rewrite what they're saying I mean how cause technically alright, speaking Catholic, ok? \n\nYes oh wanna bet?\n\nWell cause there's still there's still I don't know when it comes to religion  cause this is one of the cardinal sins you know? homosexuality is one of the huge sins but technically everyone's born with original sin, right? so, and they're baptized, they get forgiven this is from the Catholic point of view\n\nI'm not Catholic, but Catholic high school, Catholic junior high, Catholic college it's kind of gotten in my head\n\nUm  so would it be forgiven already? if you're Catholic and you've been baptized?\n\nCause you're born if, if it's genetic, and you're born with it how can you have a genetic predisposition to a sin that somebody else doesn't have they're gonna have to completely rethink things, and when it comes to evolution it's a little different I think it's a different kind of thing\n\nMmmm I think this is more about the people in the church\n\nOh, no, that's what baptism is you can get rid of original sin\n\nOh, it also the Catholic Church opposed the fork so\n\nYeah, they opposed utensils. \n\nIt was a very long time ago, but still ok this is they change that's what I'm saying things can change they do change look at Vatican two look at what you know some sects actually won't admit that it happened, but that's a different thing all together the Catholic Church is so interesting\n\nThere's also the argument that who says that kids are being perverted by parents who are close-minded and racist and you know any other number of things who's to say \n\nYeah, exactly and who's to say it's a perversion? who's to say it's just not natural? you are yes it's nature and nurture it's not one or the other it's both it's not white, it's not black, it's gray that's another situation where there is no black and white\n\nIt happens, it happens\n\nTo be honest, I don't think people would because just because of the way it's looked at in our society just the stigma that comes with it which is I'm not saying it's right, but \\\n\nI don't think genetic altering in in ugh  just mmm  totally different situation just totally different mmm\n\nWell, yeah, you could if it's a recessive gene, you could\n\nYeah, left hand is recessive, red hair is recessive, blue eyes, blonde hair, light eyes are recessive so if you have recessive gene, you could pass anything so it's anything that's genetic can be tweaked theoretically they don't have the science to do it all yet, but they could\n\nThat's exactly what I was about to say\n\nOk, I want every kid I'm gonna have to have blue haired\n\nBlonde-haired, blue-eyed, white skin or red head, green eyes you know like \n\nI think that's just messing with nature.\n\nA little too much?  A lot too much. \n\nWell they can't they can't change when it comes to things like that I think what you're thinking of is in the future right now, the only they can do is abort the child  they can't fix autism or down's syndrome they can't do that not yet anyway\n\nBut, like who gives you the right to go in a tweak with somebody's genetics?\n\nBut, I think I would be furious I'm not gonna lie that was that when you said that my first thought was like I would be furious my actual first thought was oh, I'm an expatriate\n\nI'm moving to Europe.\n\nBut\n\nI'm dead serious. I was a German citizen until I turned eighteen I would go get my German citizenship back I would give like I would be living in Germany that that's just I think that's way too \n\nExactly ok, if they do that they have to say, ok Catholics can only marry Catholics Christians can only marry Christians Jews can only marry blondes can only marry blondes brunettes can only marry like it's that kind of thing it's not only the religion it's more the genetics it's just like how dare you tell someone how to live their life and, I don't mean cause this isn't hurting anyone\n\nIt's not hurting anyone. \n\nLike now people and a lot of people a lot of gay relationships that aren't technically unions want to adopt and they can't because they won't a lot of places won't even the Federal government won't give up children to families that are or to people that are homosexual which just boggles my mind\n\nBecause there's so many people there's so many children that could have homes where they're loved and stable and taken care of and because people are close-minded they don't that just doesn't make sense\n\nIt's ok\n\nThrow it on the table. Poker\n\nI've heard that also, actually.\n\nWhich makes sense\n\nI can actually really vouch for that because with my parents my parents, my Dad and my brother me and my Mom so there's always the split now that my brother is old enough, and I'm old enough there's the split oh, it's a woman thing oh, it's a man thing and I can totally see where that makes absolute sense because there's always the fact that we're oh, we have to stay home because I'm the woman, and you're working because you're the man kinda thing and it doesn't happen it wouldn't happen\n\nAnd, if you think about it technically they're not allowed to be listed as next of kin if they're not married they can't be married as next of kin um I had a I know a situation where my friend's uncle he had a life partner and he died and he wasn't allowed at the funeral because the family didn't want him there he wasn't allowed to say goodbye he wasn't allowed to get keep anything from the house he was evicted from the house he wasn't allowed to take anything no memories, no photos, no nothing because he didn't have any rights when it came to it and , it's just they had been together for forty-five years, forty-five years, and they had no they gave him no rights \n\nIt's longer than most marriages now.\n\nI know, but like it's just he had no rights whatsoever he didn't nothing, nothing didn't get his pension didn't get anything it just ugh doesn't make sense so we're all kind of in agreement about the whole it's ok it doesn't hurt anyone why not have it?\n\nI mean, what changed your mind when you met your friends? I mean is it just the way they did you have an opinion about how gay people were in general or\n\nOh, some people of any group do that.\n\nEveryone\n\nSo you were the first people he came out to, or?\n\nI mean I think when you have traditional in any culture it's gonna shake the shake the walls a little bit so cause like oh my God, if I even like if anyone in my family ever told my grandmother that they oi I just went Yiddish for a second, I apologize um but, I mean it just it was a whole just complete, automatic turn-around for you or did it take time? I'm just curious\n\nYou still friends with him?\n\nDefinitely and I mean the fact that his mother sent him to a therapist because something was wrong ugh\n\nYou're lying to yourself\n\nI was really lucky, my high school um it was an all girls school, but anyone that was was very open with who they were and I two of my best friends from my high school are dating, and I am so happy to finally see them together because they danced around it for four years but we all kinda knew, and it didn't really matter we were I feel really lucky to have had that environment because there was nobody that was shunned for anything in that kind of situation\n\nNew York City\n\nWhich I absolutely know that's why\n\nAnd I feel absolutely lucky for it because\n\nWhere are you guys from?\n\nWhat part of Pennsylvania are you from?\n\nMy Mom grew up in Lancaster. That's all I have to say.\n\nOk, yeah so \n\nWell, I've had situations like that too, actually um  my uh one of my best friends back home came out to her family she lived in um  Stroudsburg kicked her out of the house I mean it's she came to live with her step Mom who got divorced from her Dad she accepted her it's completely different in other parts of the world\n\nThe rest of the world with a lot of things in general really America's kind of puritan a little bit you know like it's the 21st Century um and it's just it' scary thought sometimes to just think about how different the majority of our country thinks about it it's scary I don't know about you guys it scares the shit out of me\n\nExcuse my language, but it just does\n\nIt just changes I mean it was when immigrants first came it was the Irish and the Russian, and now it's the then it went to the African American then it went to well, it was African American and then it was African American again you know it's just and also you know it's against women and then in some places against men and it just it just changes \n\nI don't listen to George Carlin I'm a Christopher Titus [inaudible] fan, myself so \n\nOk, English doesn't English doesn't \n\nOther countries borrow form other languages English English follows other languages into the alley and then beats them and then looks through their pockets for loose grammar\n\nBut, go for it.\n",
        "Let’s just go around and\n\nYeah \n\nYes \n\nThere’s always gonna be discrimination. There’s always gonna be like that person like I still believe in this\n\nIn general you are smarter than me in math. I can guarantee you.\n\nIt’s this like different skills it’s just natural\n\nWhat there’s some like alright I’ll say I am a secretary and it’s weird to admit that sometimes because there’s the whole\n\nNo, no do people go up to him and ask him if he gets pinched on the butt?\n\nYeah, yeah. People ask me that I’m like no um\n\nDo you wear a skirt to work? I’m like no I’m straight and I’m a guy so um it’s weird to admit because it is a very girly job\n \nUm let’s see desk management\n\nUm Remax American Dream the real estate company and um yeah so I don’t know it’s it’s a good job obviously but sometimes ya know I always joke about it ya know I’m a guy and I’m a secretary ya know um it’s just the whole parody where like you make fun of it ya know\n\nOh, I totally agree.\n\nWhat? You’re sayin if a guy sees a girl in the ROTC he automatically oh I’m not\n",
        " Yea  I think one of the primary reasons for that  is that  this is an issue that's just starting to be addressed  and  to get to the CEO position\n\n It takes decades  so  I think it's in the process of correcting itself  and  maybe in the next couple of decades we're gonna start to see that \n\n I don't know  I really do feel like that's starting to change\n \n Just as great\n\n That's interesting  I thought I saw something in the paper  where  the city schools actually beat the county schools  on  um  standardized tests  just recently  like  I thought I saw it  but maybe it would have just been cities versus  yea  I didn't read far into it\n\n I just saw where they're gonna expand them actually\n\n I think to more  I think Towson University is actually going to be taking over some of it\n\n Subsidization\n\n Agreed\n\n When I  um  in my organizational behavior class  they were just discussing gender issues among other diversity issues  and really  up until like the 1980s early 90s  that was a huge problem in the workplace  as far as  women  not \n\n The industry they highlighted was the financial industry  especially where  masculinity completely takes over  I was just shocked to hear how recent of an issue that really was\n\n But  I really think all the lawsuits that came out of that  are what  caused so much change\n\n And that's what really  um  not only propelling the movement forward  that's also that's why you're seeing  that celebrated  that the females are  reaching the CEO roles\n\n Oh  yea  yea  yea\n\n I think we're already  on the right track  and  maybe  I'm  prime example  just bring it up  that it's already in our education system  you tend to see schools already working out  especially  in your business classes  diversity is a pretty hot topic  I know  um  part of the scholars program  for the  the business school  and they spend  a whole year  it's part of their  um  Sellinger scholars experience\n\n First year  it's just all diversity  alone  that's  that's how big they think it's  becoming an issue  in the  just important from a management standpoint  you have to be able to recognize it  recognize that there are different viewpoints  different ways of communicating  for a while  women wouldn't be  um  promoted  because  their way of communication wasn't really  perceived as  confidence  from a male  when it was just a different way of communicating  that has nothing to do with confidence  I think education is just the key thing  you gotta educate the people who are gonna be out in the workforce  dealing with it  and  those people haven't quite reached  or gotten far enough in  that's why I think we are gonna see the positive  um  effects  in a couple of decades\n\n I think it's a pretty huge marketing strategy  because people are starting to realize  we're missing half the audience out there\n\n And if you can start  hitting that  whether it's just your product or your TV show  of course it's gonna do better  cause you're appealing to 50% more\n\n I think everyone's really discriminated on  sometime in their life  for something or other\n\n I just don't think the effects  of discrimination on men  is readily shown in society  clearly  it hasn't affected positions within companies or anything like that\n\n  But  I mean  of course  everyone's discriminated against\n\n Um  I mean  I really  already said that  I mean  I think  they do  everybody gets discriminated against  you can always pick out a  particular situation where someone's discriminated against  I just don't think the repercussions are really there for men\n\n I mean  it's an issue  but  we all feel like it's working itself out and  slowly turning around  things aren't really just gonna happen overnight \n\n I have a personal experience I'll share.  I think  um  the place  I have an internship at  um  PHH  it's a place out on [inaudible]  I don't know if you guys know about it  but  I found it really interesting that I when went there  I mean  this is  it's a fleet leasing company  it had a lot to do with cars  so the stereotype is  there are gonna be like 90% guys working there  but  it's the complete opposite  I think there's like 70 girls  70% women  and  30% men  at the department I was working in  there's 7 supervisors  and then a director  the director is a woman  6 of the supervisors were women  there was one man  so  I mean  not to say I was surprised  I just thought that interesting  cause  you'd hear all this hype in school  that it's such a problem  and I got there  I was like  maybe men are being discriminated against   that was just a joke at the end\n\n I just found that interesting. \n\n\n\n",
        "What's missing is every time it happens, they're all on the daily news you know it's like it's like um the third or fourth story you hear about in your local news everyday you got the St. Mary's or the not St. Mary's it wouldn't be at St. Mary's, but whatever \n\nYeah\n\nYeah, it seems like there isn't actually a valid argument against it.\n\nI was gonna say I still think it's very generational we're at a time right now where people already are becoming more accepting it's already more of the culture like you said like you have two friends that are probably around the same age as you maybe, but they're out per say like you know they're gay whereas like it was a type of situation where the generation before us if those same kids would have come out their parents would have kicked them out of the house they would become pariahs not only with their family but with the community now it's like you go there's certain cities certain cultures where you can go to and be accepted, thus making it more a part of our country in general like being gay is not like it's not being necessarily a minority you're just part of whatever you are, and you have a different sexual preference it's more accepted, it's not close\n\nIt's still not perfect.\n\nAnybody lives in the northeastern pretty close to it\n\nYou're from L.A.?\n\nI didn't know that.\n\nLike Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins?\n\nI was just giving you an example \n \nYou don't know who Tim Robbins is? Tim Robbins is the guy from Shawshank Redemption been in a lot of other movies\n\nNo, I [inaudible] absolutely I just really don't like the topic in general because I think it's just like it's like blatant like bigotry or whatever you want to call it like it's in front of people's eyes but everyone has opinions about it like if everybody was was completely um respectful of everybody else's personal preferences of sexuality and what not then there would be no question about it\n\nSo, it's blatant discrimination, but people are cool with it. Most of our country is cool with it apparently. \n\nOh um to some people it's not so clear cut um well, that's part of the controversy um at least one of the things that's been brought up some cite it as a disease or sickness in the sense that it's a result of a biochemical imbalance in the brain and there's some places some churches that offer therapy to correct um\n\nWhat?\n\nWell, another part of um the controversy is that some I can't speak to the validity of it, but um some people would cite environmental factors in terms of like determining whether someone is actually gay or just confused um so there's that whole issue and it's also what I've heard anyway, and part of the argument against homosexuals being able to adopt um is that it might um pervert the child's world view, whereas I think it would rather lend them a more open mind\n\nAnother thing that well that I read about I can't remember where um that's not good um \n\nBut, with regard to um genetic planning or family planning um like say uh handicapped people there's a debate over this um have the option to have a child that is handicapped um they can go in and actually do that like a deaf couple actually wants a deaf child that would have otherwise been normal there's been debate though I think it's speculative at this point um concerning whether or not a gay couple could if they chose artificial insemination or something like that could do that assuming they could isolate a gene for that \n\nUh I don't know\n. \nSome people say that it's just I'm not supporting it in any way  um they say that that um it's an extension of this idea well if you know that say you're child is going to have autism or what not you can go in and change that so as to suit what you want to do can't you change and do that\n\nNo, you're right, that was just a thought disease\n\nThat's what my friend said that uh he was serious that uh if ever that did come to pass that he would just up and leave\n\nAnother statistic I just don't know if it's accurate or the source\n\nUm, but um the general trend at least is that gay couples tend to show less dissension or greater cooperation than heterosexual couples I don't know if that's true or not\n\nIn the sense of like in the sense of rather than they're being conflict over like things that could be written as like a gender difference um that there's a heightened level of understanding between people with similar needs and expectations and\n\nThat as a result of that that it would provide a better environment in which to raise a child \n\nJust, I was incredibly close-minded it was um probably right before high school um and I just went on the assumption, and like based on what I was told and based on what I had heard um like they were some group to be shunned, they were just there to intentionally weird out other folks which is completely ludicrous\n\nRight, but I thought this applied to everyone [inaudible]\n\nBut, like then a friend of mine just sends me an email one day and says, look I'm gay and like he sent it to two people me and another friend\n\nYeah, and was like I probably will need your help now more than ever because he was having some problems telling his parents and his Mom sent him to a therapist to like get that checked cause she didn't believe him and his Dad just I he still doesn't get along too well with his father because of that um or at least it didn't help anything so it's just based on what he has told me and another friend of mine um is bisexual she hasn't told her parents that um but, her friends and everyone they're very supportive of her but, for her parents to know they're really traditional Indian parents it wouldn't be good\n\nUm like I was sort of confused at first, but like given a day I just thought through it like he's still one of my closest friends I've known him this long, I'm not gonna up and leave and it just made me reassess what I had previously thought and um and I called him afterwards and saw that everything was fine still talked to him \n\nYeah, he came by to visit like a while ago.\n\nMaryland\n\n",
        "Ok    um  I  personally  am  fine with it  um  but  like  we had this discussion before  I feel like  the term that they use  is  not right  like marriage  is not right  like if it was  like  how  I think they use like civil union  or  whatever  or  I don't even care  but  I feel like  marriage is like a sacrament  and  it should be kept as a sacrament  just  so  just change the name  but  yea  other than that  I think it's fine\n\nYea\n\nYea  I don't think  I think it should be non-existent\n\nLike as  yea  like  making it legal in a state  or per state  I don't think religion should matter  and  I mean  I guess  per couple  like  it  that's their deal  but making it legal  I guess  I don't see any problem with that\n\nRight\n\nMaybe  I guess it  would  but  still just  the name of it  like it shouldn't  like  if it's not gonna be called marriage it should have absolutely nothing to do with the church unless the couple's Catholic and they want to make it an issue  and I don't  I don't understand why they would even bring it into it\n\nUh-huh\n\nYea\n\nI think they just want to be recognized  as any married couple would\n\nRight  I think it'll be  like  voting for it  or anything like that  I think it'll get easier as like  like  years down the road  cause like  people right now are like  the  main people who are voting for this right now are like  ya know  like middle aged  older people  who were raised like  to know that  homosexual couples were bad  and homosexuality is horrible  and  a lot of other stuff  we're kind of growing up with it  and we're seeing it as it's normal  so  I think years down the road it won't be  as big of a problem\n\nYea\n\nYea\n\nUh-huh\n\nUm\n\nYea \n\nYea  I know  yea  what's the point\n\n[Inaudible] \n\nYea\n\nI don't either.\n\nUh-huh \n\nIt's nothing they won't see in the future anyway \n\nSomeone play devil's advocate.\n\nI guess I see where they're coming from  but  I don't know  I don't know \n\nRight\n\nSo\n\nNo\n\nSome tension\n\nYea\n\nGenetic I think\n\nYea  I still think it's a little bit of both\n\nI mean  if you have it  you have it  but  I guess if  you can like  I guess act on it  I guess \n\nYea\n\nRight  yea\n\nThat's weird\n\nYea?

Or?\n\n[S6] Yea I mean and it's not like you there are a handful of married Catholic priests around the country and the way to do it is to become an Episcopalian priest first \n\nOh, really?\n\nSo Episcopalians can be married? \n\nWhat are the other religions that you guys know?\n\nI didn't even know priests I feel kind of stupid saying this but I didn't even know priests like under the Catholic religion could get married I guess I just know what I know from my town, from my church, and that's\n\nMakes me feel a little better [Laughter]\n \n\nI guess to continue the pedophile thing um did you I'm not very clear on the whole situation are any of you? On what happened like was there a cover-up or something I just remember hearing different rumors about\n\nUh-huh\n\nA couple cases?\n\nWere you guys impacted at all by it?\n\nDo you?\n.\n\nAnd what did he think?\n\nOh really?\n\nDo you think the church would that would stuff like that would change if um priests were able to be married?\n\nBut isn't it like I don't know I've heard stories like even on TV like Special Victims Unit and all like those Law and Order shows [Laughter] it's like you'll have married couples married men who have like that secret life and they're pedophiles\n\nBut they do they do have those urges even though they have a wife\n\nIt'd be an easy job \n\nI agree but I don't think it's ever gonna happen\n\nI don't think it will ever change.\n\nThey're set in their ways\n\nForever\n\nWhy do you think that is?\n\nYou don't think it's as pressured over? \n\nYou don't think it's as pressured life is as pressured?\n\nEurope we're talking about?\n\nDid you guys ever hear there's a new um movie coming out with Dakota Fanning in it but you heard about that?\nAnd they're did you hear?\n\nThere's like a rape scene and she's like a little girl being raped by an older man and there were a lot of people that were protesting to that just because it gives you like a like you were saying like a visual\n\nLike the idea?\n\nI wanted to go to church after I saw it [Laughter]\n\nYea intense \n\nWhat does your uncle think?\n\nDid he ever give you into any insight as to why he thinks does he want priests to get married?\n\nOh wow\n\nNo not you [Laughter]\n\nI don't know I kind of appreciate that structure\n\nSometimes I do I don't know why\n\nWhat are you now? Are you anything? Or?\n\nOh\n\nAnd what are you?\n\nWith as him?\n\nYea\n\nWhat did you guys start questioning? I'm just curious. \n\nOk \n\nOh about abortion?\n\nUm I I think it's so easy to say like no abortion but then when you are in that specific situation it really depends on each person like cause I know I've had friends who have ya know had the near mishap like their period comes a month late and just they freak out about it and that question comes to mind and then when you kind of sit there thinking about it I actually have a good friend of mine who had an abortion when she was in the 8th grade so at that point in time I guess I would understand it but I don't know if I would ever be able to do it\n\nI don't like I agree with like the whole rape thing that's just an awful thing\n\nTo think about it and you're right about like you may not want to give up the baby once you had it in you for 9 months and but then but then would you be able to live with the baby\n\nCause you know what half of that came out of such an angry such an awful type of thing\n\nUh-huh No I agree with you\n\nUh-huh\n\nIt's not free is it free? No.\n\nThat's what I thought [inaudible]\n\nI don't know cause like I said I was Catholic I guess but then like what is your opinion on this like I say that that but then I would consider in like a situation like that an abortion\n\nWell to say what I feel like yea\n\nIsn't G-d supposed to forgive us?\n\nIs against the religion to go to smoke?\n\nI understand the whole like when you sin we're supposed to be sinning like at least when we have sex\n\nCause it's supposed to be a sacred act and you're supposed to produce and that's what sex is supposed to be I just never thought about smoking as a sin\n\nLike cigarettes or like weed stuff like? \n\nBoth ok\n\nOk any substance\n\nWhat were some the reasons why G-d did you read it? Or you just\n\n[Laughter]\n\n\nThey only had 6 weeks?\n\nOh ok.\n\n I almost forgot what we were talking about\n\t\nI remember you bringing it back a few times [Laughter]Thank you\n\nOk yea I don't think they will\n\nI could see where you guys come from on some different points but yea I just don't think we will\n\nI feel like it's effortless like you shouldn't even try to bother almost I hate to say that\n\nYea to try to change it cause we can't really you were right like you said you have to be up in the hierarchy to actually make a change and\n\nWe we definitely can't\n\nThat's a good point.\n\n\n",
        "  But, I feel like if you're gonna  Ok, sorry  If you're gonna  sorry\n\n  [inaudible]\n\n  So Catholics believe that like Muslims can get into heaven, but Protestants can't?\n\n  Well you said Catholics.\n\n  Purgatory\n\n  I don't know what you mean\n\n  Oh my God,\n\n  I can't believe that's the good thing to do.\n\n  What about like female priests, like you said?\n\n  That's true\n\n  That's how it is here, but that doesn't mean that's how it is everywhere else.\n\n  And I think in order for  like it's not the United States where the catholic Church is gonna change. I think it's gotta be in Europe first  ya know  cause that's where it originated and that's where it's roots are from\n\n  Yeah  so I feel like changing the catholic church is like in regards to \nwomen being priests  I don't know if that will happen\n\n  By limiting them you don't think that it's a big deal\n\n  Like I don't even know like I feel like a women priest wouldn't get as much respect  people wouldn't necessarily go be gung-ho to go to a church with a woman priest  I feel like it would be hard for\n\n  I'm not saying that's a reason why women shouldn't be allowed to be priests but I'm just saying it would be hard for a women priest to get the same respect in the church.\n\n  It's true.\n\n  Completely?\n\n  It's really hard to base things on the bible though cause there's so many ways to interpret it. You can construe it however you want.\n\n  That's why churches are so different.\n  Cause it's kind of inconsistent within itself and you don't know how literal or how figuratively to take things.\n\n  I think especially the being allowed to marry could affect it  with female priests I mean I don't really see that connection as much.\n\n  It might not have come out though\n\n  I wonder if the majority of pedophiles are married or unmarried.\n\n  Well like if it's true that more unmarried are pedophile then it would be like repressed sexual desires that are causing them to do these things to children which would mean that priests would be more likely to be pedophiles because they have repressed sexual desires  so that would be an argument for it\n\n  It's not a reason\n\n  Well, yeah. You definitely need the priest to have something messed up inside of him to want to do that.\n\n  To become a pedophile. But the church might also contribute to it. It can exist without the person also being messed up and it can exist without the church.\n\n  Well yeah  but that goes without saying.\n\n  Yeah.\n\n  Yeah  I think I meant to say that.\n\n[S19]I think  well  let me try and explain it. You definitely the person to be messed up in order for them to be a pedophile and if the church.\n\n  A predisposition towards pedophilia  um  and if the church says that he can't marry it may also contribute to it but only if he already has that predisposition.\n\n  So if the church said marriage was not fine as it currently is  it wouldn't make priests who weren't already predisposed toward pedophilia become pedophiles  they have to have that already.\n\n  But they already have to have the predisposition.\n\n  What?\n\n  I feel like as soon as you're a priest, you're a priest.\n\n  That would be helpful  well  maybe not every year but every like five years\n  Do you think there'd be like enough priests like that if they weeded out people?\n\n  Especially compared to the historically less people wanna be priests nowadays I'd say\n\n\n\n",
        "And I think it's like a it's got to be a situational kind of thing because if it's to prevent a school shooting then obviously you got to act on that information whether or not it's an invasion of privacy.\n\nI don't think they should actively seek it out like have a commission that looks at students' profiles, but if they've come across information that could \n \nAlthough, if you're talking about pictures where like you're holding a beer can, that still doesn't prove that you were drinking. There's no way to prove from a picture that you were doing anything, at least drinking.\n\nThat's true.\n\nI think that it'd be necessary to have a system where they listen for code words like bomb or assassinate those kinds of things I think it's something like in the D.C. area they monitor more heavily but like that that doesn't mean they're listening they're listening for like the words and then they would listen in on those conversations\n\nRight, it's for our own safety so\n\nI think people are against it because it seems like racial profiling because a lot of the calls they pick up are from Middle Eastern you know terrorist [inaudible] so I mean it seems kind of racial, but that's just the way it's just the way it is\n\nRight, the ones that are threats.\n\n",
        "well  I don't know  I feel like we should open it up first to the ladies\n\nDo you feel discriminated against?\n\nI feel like  I mean Hilary is a step  but  right now she's not gonna win  she's not gonna come close  they're going to elect a black guy before they elect a woman  so  um  I don't know  it's kinda hard to debate this because  I mean  no one is really for gender discrimination \n\nbut um  I don't know  I feel like it really is changing right now  so  um  there's almost in some places  we're coming up with this kind of reverse discrimination  where  um  more money go towards like female sports teams or whatnot in order to  uh  feel like  they're like overcompensating for discriminating in the past  it's this entirely new issue coming \n\nSomething else that comes to mind when I think of Hilary though is that  uh  ya know  how is she coming to power? Well it was because she was married to Bill  ya know  a man who was president  so  I mean  it's a step but it's still only a little step\n\nI'm not doubting her ability to do anything\n\nI was just commentating on how she  kind of gained the ability \n\nSomething I did want to mention  someone before said something about the world wasn't ready for a female president  I don't really feel like it's the entire world  I mean  look at countries in Europe and elsewhere  and ya know  females have equal power  I mean  the leaders of their countries have been women before  like several times  and  I feel like it's just America  I mean not just America  but  America is behind other countries  in  uh  equal rights for women   I don't know you. You can go.\n\nI'm actually taking a class on Islam  and  like  really like Americans cant like   imagine  like this is an entirely different culture  and like the women  like  we've been sending people over there to try to make equal rights  but  half of the women don't even feel like they're being discriminated against  they feel like this is how  the way things are the way things should be so  and  like how they have to wear coverings all over their body and  all that  I mean  they feel it's kind of empowering actually  so \n\nThere's still only so many like management positions  like  the CEO of the company  there's only one  I mean  there may be more girls in college  as long as there are guys  there's still  like  a really good chance the guy will get the higher opportunities  so \n\nSomething else you have to wonder about  like I'm not saying I'm on a certain side of this  but like  whether private companies should have to worry about something like this  I mean it's the same question  like racially too  like  just for like a weird example  um  like Baskin Robbins only hires girls  I think \nWell the one  at least the ones where I live do\n\nlike is that discrimination or is  I don't know\n\nI think it's really hard to achieve absolute equality between males and females.  Um  and  like  even at a time when like females might like  gain more power than men  ya know  I don't know  it's kinda hard to phrase what I feel like.  Someone is always going to have more power.  You can't really avoid discrimination.  It's  ya know  humans are humans \n\nAnother question we have to ask is do we want everything to be exactly equal? I mean like  do we want a company to be like  split fifty-fifty female-male  I mean  I mean I'm sure there are women that want to live as like a housewife and males like as the primary like  moneymaker in the family  and ya know  in some families it may be the opposite but  I feel like as long as there's like a fluctuation  like it's up to personal choice  I mean that's as close to equality as we're going to get\n\nI mean  it's that kind of  it's that certain brand of feminism that says that women have to be men and  it's the  that just can't happen  I mean  um  embracing femininity  or like  I don't know it's just  that's equality too\n\nUm  I guess something else  that I just started thinking about  my sister  um  I think she's getting like a minor in gender studies or something and  like there's this question of like what gender really is  like what makes a woman a woman and what makes a man a man  and  I don't know  I don't really know where I was going to go with that\n\nIt seems like this question is still in the air  I mean  like with technology too  I mean  there are like  I mean there are like sex change operations and there are like men who feel that they're like  better suited to live as a woman and  I don't know  gender is just a highly like  like right now  like we're not sure  like what it really means  or something [inaudible]\n\nI guess what I was trying to get at was like  I mean there's this like socially defined male and a socially defined female  and like  what are their real roles in society? And some men feel that their role isn't as what is socially defined as male \n\nAnd I guess the opposite of that is like  talking about the draft before  like females in the army  so  there's like  for every example for discrimination against one sex there's an example for discrimination against the other \n\nWell  I feel also that like  I mean the children  let's say they're raised as a female but they feel like they're a male  they're going to be really tomboyish\n\nI mean  they're gonna probably wear pants  and  like dress like a boy\n",
        "Yea\n\nWow\n\nYea\n\nYes \n\nI don't know\n\nI don't know I'm not well-informed on it but I feel like the government really hyped it up and played on people's emotions a lot after 9-11 and especially with the weapons of mass destruction and everything and \n\nI don't know I felt like going after Osama Bin Laden was a good idea but when it got to Saddam Hussein and Iraq\n\nAnd Yea it just took on a whole life of its own\n\nThe thing started out as like us going into get Osama Bin Laden \n\nHe's in the Middle East now and hey as long as we're here \n\nRight\n\nRight\n\nRight there's no way we can win this\n\n I mean we're going in in uniforms and stuff and they're like the townspeople\n\nAnd unless we change and we look like Iraqi civilians with machine guns there's no way we're gonna win the war\n\nIt that's what it sounds like except we did the same thing in Vietnam\n\nI'm so ignorant like I really don't feel like I don't understand why it's our problem\n\nRight right what's the UN for?\n\nBut they could they could have more power \n\nNo I mean I think it would be a good idea to give the UN more power instead of getting into situations like this on our own \n\nWell or you'd be like what the hell? Get out of my country which is\n\nWell that's like half the country \n\nYea \n\nAnd I think they really played on those kinds of emotions in people like everyone felt that way after 9-11 and the government comes along and they're like we can do something about it\n\nYea\n\nSo what made them think it would work better if we've already been there we know the situation and we know like how they fight we know the land is going to be like working against us the whole time the people how did that sound like a good idea in the first place? Like other than emotionally\n\nYea\n\nYea \n\nI gotta go back to the whole it's not our job thing I mean it is our it's our responsibility to work towards it \n\nWell yea I mean right and those people deserve like a better life than they had under Saddam Hussein\n\nYea but to go in just as us I mean \n\nYea right there weren't too many willing from what I understood\n\nThat's like everyone you are drafting  \n\nYea \n\nNothing will change\n\nNo I totally support getting rid of all the wackos and I totally support taking action it's just one country against the world and that sets us up even more is this this power that like some Iraqi's have painted us as like the the guys who just come in and like take over everything and just force their own way on other people and I mean we need the support of other we need the visibly and economic support of other countries to be able to keep doing this\n\nYea but I mean we've been trying to get it on the right path and nothing's really changed I mean we've been having like the elections over there and stuff but in the neighborhoods things are still going the same way I mean people are still shooting each other and there's still the same amount of tension and political unrest and\n\nBut\n\nNo I agree\n\nI agree we have a responsibility to do something but until someone comes up with a plan I mean\n\nDidn't President Bush declare the war over? Like a long time ago\n\nLike a couple years ago\n\nYea \n\nYea \n\nEspecially when it's not our culture too and we're trying to go in and fix it\n\nYea\n\nRight\n\nYea\n\nI think we should've I almost think we should've waited longer to go into the whole thing until people's emotions kind of settled down cause everyone was so so gung-ho about it and you should never be that I don't know\n\nYea\n\nRight\n\nRight that's the thing yea we should have waited to decide whether or not to go all out and how much we wanted to do and how much time we wanted to spend there\n\nI mean you can never tell everything ahead of time but it doesn't seem like we really had a place\n\npicked up a newspaper\n\nBut \n\nYea\n\nNo that's true like everyone like I don't mean to be down on Bill Gates or anything but everyone celebrates him so much cause he donates to all these charities and stuff he gives like a million away but I mean \nTo Bill Gates a million dollars is like\n\nYea \n\nSo I mean he's setting a good example but\n\nYea\n\nYea \n\nYea\n\nI don't there's one thing I don't understand is a lot of I've heard a lot of people compare the war in Iraq to Vietnam and but what you said is true nobody cares about the war in Iraq but the war in Vietnam everyone was protesting and there was so much going on but was the was everyone here that uncomfortable in the 70s that made it that much bigger a deal\n\nRight but I mean that's what's supposed to be if this is like Vietnam and we see the same thing happening and so many people are saying hey it's Vietnam all over again why still doesn't anyone care? \n\nYea\n\nThat's true\n\n",
        "Oh, my I have nice, fun opinions about this one um absolutely I mean, think about it the Catholic Church once condemned the fork\n\nThey did. They condemned utensils. They need to change with the times I mean look at just the way our society is does not fit with the way our society was when the rules were set down in the medieval times.\n\nI have a question. Who's Catholic? Are you Christian?\n\nWhat are you, just out of curiosity?\n\nYou're Jewish? Ok, um I'm non-denominational anything I don't believe in organized religion.\n\nBasically um I'll go to church if I feel like I need it I think I don't need to go to church to speak to a higher power if that's what I need so to me, the Catholic Church is absolutely bonkers\n\nWell, that's also because you don't have to go confess to a man who has no right to tell you [inaudible]\n\nIt's like, Ok because they're right because we said they were right in the past, we have to say they're right now, because if we say they're not right now that means automatically they're not right then\n\nCatholic Church if you think about it they say a lot of times the reason they say they can't change something is because that would mean that they're admitting that they're wrong, and they can't be wrong they're human give them I mean what do you think about on the issue with the Pope?\n\nWhich makes no sense he's human\n\nBut, that's not possible. No human can be infallible.\n\nNow, I've gotten different opinions on this one\n\nNo, go ahead.\n\nThe Pope was in Hitler's youth that's not an error?\n\nThis particular Pope was in Hitler's youth, but if he's infallible is he automatically infallible from time he's elected Pope? That doesn't make sense.\n\nUmm, still\n\nBut, he's also said like he's stated that it was his choice he's stated it he has talked about it it wasn't by coercion for him this is something I feel really strongly about I'm sorry this is just there's no way for a person to be infallible especially if oh, Ok, so he becomes Pope and everything he's ever done has never been a mistake\n\nI was raised Catholic so I know the dogma I was raised Catholic and Lutheran weird combination I went to church twice every Sunday my entire life I was baptized when I was in fifth grade my parents gave me a choice to be Lutheran or to be Catholic it was crazy I'm sorry, I'm sorry all of my friends are Catholic it just doesn't make sense to me and also\n\nI think that it needs to change I think that it's a lot of parts of the Catholic Church have always needed to change I mean women aren't allowed in the clergy\n\nWhy honestly according the Catholic Church, women are the root of all evil that is still doctrine\n\nEpiscopalians and if it's in the Catholic Church they're \n\nYes they are Episcopalians, and I can't remember the other one they're a branch of Catholicism\n\nIt's only if you were married before you became a Priest you can't be married after you become a Priest\n\nThey're Catholic\n\nMy friend's an Episcopalian Catholic\n\nIt's a branch of Catholicism I'm Protestant I am Protestant I'm baptized, I used to teach Sunday school\n\nEpiscopalians are a branch of Catholicism they just don't agree with everything they're still considered Catholic\n\nUm but, when it comes to Communion I've gotten different opinions from different Catholics on this is it the body and blood of Christ? Is it symbolism? Personally, not doctrinally because I know the doctrine personally, as a Catholic, do you believe that it's really blood and flesh that you're eating cause that's what it's supposed to it's supposed to be transmogrified into body and flesh of Christ that's what the Catholic Church says\n\nOk\n\nAs Catholic, you're supposed to believe that it's literal.\n\nScience we have the proof that it's not possible, also things like the view from the Catholic Church that a Priest can forgive you for your sins \n\nI honestly think that as a society, we've grown the point where we've realized that no one can forgive us for our sins besides ourselves and God.\n\nThen why is the middle man there? I mean I understand that it was there during the Dark Ages because people didn't really connect with God, but people have the ability to now.\n\nOk, I can see that. That's  I could see that's the reason for having a Priest the confession doesn't make sense to me it never will\n\nI don't know I don't know if I agree because according to Catholicism you're not allowed to go up to the altar unless you've confessed that day on Sundays when you go to church\n\nI don't agree with organized religion in general that's just my thing\n\nOk, I have another one. Sorry when it comes to issues of contraception, right? The Catholic Church is against it now back a little not even far back families were a lot bigger because you could support them on land, could support them money could support them that's not possible now, and to expect a just basically you're supposed to you're allowed to have sex with your parents with you're a spouse your parents? haven't slept in two days \n\nWith your spouse and not only for procreation reasons, but you're not supposed to use contraception? It's not I think it's almost what's the word I'm looking for? Not detrimental, but it's irresponsible of the church to say you can't use contraception just population wise especially with the amount of people that are Catholic and the amount of people that dogmatically follow that follow what the Catholic dogma is dogmatically follow? doggedly follow what Catholic dogma is\n\nMy mistake, I was thinking of something else.\n\nThen there must be another, there's another I know there's a branch of Catholicism that's not I must just be mixing up the name, so my apology\n\nBut, they also have to be married before they become\n\nBut, just back to what I'm saying about the contraception like I think it's irresponsible not only fiscally, but for the world in general it's irresponsible\n\nLike, do you have any opinion on it whatsoever or cause I know there's a lot of Catholics that do listen to it, and a lot of Catholics that don't so and as a Catholic should you listen to everything that the Catholic Church says?\n\nSo then don't you think it should change? if you don't agree with it if there are things that you don't agree with for good reasons shouldn't and there's a lot of people that disagree with it, but they're still claiming to be Catholic isn't that a problem?\n\nBut, shouldn't they change then? if they're ridiculous\nThat's what the question's asking should it change?\n\nI'm not saying everything has to change just there are some things that are definitely, majorly problematic\n\nQuick question about the women and the clergy thing do you think that adds to gender discrimination just going back to do you think that like the rule that women can't be in the clergy and they can only be nuns do you think that adds to gives people more of an excuse to say oh, it's ok because it's the Catholic Church that does it just back to what we were talking about before actually yeah I mean I guess people could use that as a rationale and I guess it is gender discriminatory\n \nIt's not tradition, it's rules like there's a difference between a tradition and a rule\n\nIt has nothing to do with the religion.\n\nOh, absolutely.\n\nUhh let me say something about that the Bible did not arrive by fact from heaven it's written by man\n \nThe same thing with the Torah and the Koran\n\nApparently?\n \nLike um what you were saying about it's discretion I know a lot of very, very intelligent people I'm going to use my grandmother as an example she built a pharmaceutical company in a time when you know women didn't work in Germany like went to med school you know she's a very intelligent woman she believes everything the Catholic Church says, and will listen to everything the Catholic Church says regardless of logic regardless of science because it is the Catholic Church and the Catholic Church is right, and there is a lot of people like that I'm not saying that's just the Catholic Church there's Muslims, Jews, Buddhists not so much Buddhists uh, Hindus any religion almost is like that\n\nAnd, it's a big it's this whole that whole again \n\nHonestly no it's I just think that sometimes there's a problem with blindly following something\n\nYou know what\n\nThere's also that, but I don't know I don't think that I have to I have my faith I'm very strongly about my faith, but it's not \n\nNo, it's faith to me. I believe in God.\n\nI believe in God, I just have my own beliefs about who He is and I think that's absolutely Ten Commandments great thing because they're moral\n\nThose are things that \n\nLike which? I'm curious.\n\nAbsolutely I don't think it's um\n\nI don't know if it's mmm I think that Ok, I can see what you're saying I absolutely see what you're saying, but like things like thou shall not kill\n\nThou shall not commit adultery, thou shall not steal\n\nWhich technically\n\nThat's a different one there is adultery I can't remember exactly how it's worded\n\nSabbath is just technically day of rest. Technically if you want to bring it down to bare bones, it's the day that God rested, and it's honestly Sunday yeah it's a day of rest for me\n\nThat's fine. But, I honestly saying that you have to go to church every Sunday is a little ridiculous. I don't think that you have to be in a certain building to speak to God.\n\nNo, I totally agree with you but, the Catholic Church is one of the only religions that completely negates every other like they say the Catholic Church you're Catholic, you have to be Catholic you're gonna go to heaven if you're Catholic I know it's not like that I don't know I'm not sure how it is exactly with the Jewish religion, but the Christians, Protestants you can come up to the altar and you can get a blessing no matter who you are Catholics you can't you cannot come to the altar of God for communion if you are not Catholic\n\nYou can't, not you can't I went I've gone to Catholic Church since I've been baptized I'm not allowed I've talked to priests, I've talked to nuns of different sects you're not allowed to get a blessing during communion unless you're Catholic\n\nYou are only allowed to be at the table of God if you are Catholic.\n\nSince I'm not Catholic, and I was baptized Lutheran and confirmed Lutheran I was not allowed to go up for communion at my Baccalaureate Mass even for a blessing I was not allowed it was a Catholic Church\n\nThat was at St. Patrick's Cathedral.\n\nThat's at St. Patrick's Cathedral you're not allowed no\n\nI'm just saying what's doctrine.\nThat's fine, I've never been trained as a Eucharistic Minister.\n\nUm but I was not allowed to go up to the altar at St. Patrick's Cathedral, which to my father was a huge deal because my father was born and raised Catholic he goes and does confession that's his thing and he hasn't had he hasn't confessed, he won't get communion you're not allowed you're technically not allowed to get communion if you haven't confessed that day\n\nIt's exclusive. The problem with the Catholic Church is that only Catholics are right I mean there's room for error, there's no room for if someone is Muslim you know but leads a good life technically they can go to heaven, but no they don't go to heaven and they're in limbo mmmm\n\nUm the Muslim faith says everyone will go to heaven because everyone is inherently Muslim, which I think basically to me and to the people that I know are Muslim says that just everyone is inherently good and if they lead a good life they're gonna\n\nWhat about the Crusades?\n\nThat's God, but what about the Crusades? People did the same thing in the Catholic religion.\n\nI'm not saying it's\n\nOh, I know. I'm not saying there's not problems in any other religion, but that's one that I notice that bothers me really like that bothers me about the Muslim religion there are things that bother me about the Muslim religion about every religion which is why I have problems with organized religion I think there's problems with all of them I mean it's great that people find that people find solace in itself\n\nBut, according to religion you're supposed to follow it to the letter or you're\n\nI'm just saying that that's what that's the dogma though\n\nYou're supposed to\n\nYou're supposed to live it according to the religion.\n\nI chose not to that's my choice\n\nBut, if you have to choose to be in the Catholic Church, you're supposed to follow it to the letter of the law.\n\nThat's then they then they if you speak to strict Catholics, they will not consider you Catholic\n\nMy grandmother does not consider my father Catholic anymore.\n\nBecause my father married a non-catholic woman, and because he doesn't go to church every Sunday. \n\nDid you fast on Ash Wednesday? You're not supposed to eat on Ash Wednesday or Holy Thursday.\n\nAre you? Sorry, my mistake I kind of I forget you guys are freshman\n\nOk um my mistake cause I thought \n\nSorry, my mistake.\n\nAnd they're supposed to be followed otherwise it's a sin.\n \nI think the picture of right has changed over the ages too though.\n\nUm that's your opinion I don't begrudge you your opinion um  I hope you don't begrudge me mine\n\nI'm not so much saying conform as I'm saying that there are certain things that do need to change.\n\nNo, I don't attack every there's many things about any religion that are good and pure and fabulous for anyone that not everyone maybe because for everyone it's different, but I mean there was a time when I was very religious I taught Sunday school for four years I was um kicked out of my church for teaching what was taught to me in my Confirmation class which was that the Genesis was uh symbolism, but the woman who ran the Sunday school didn't agree with the priest, so she kicked me out for teaching what I was taught\n\nAnd, I mean there's problems anywhere um  but, it kind of disillusioned me I guess to it so my views have changed they've evolved, and I think that sometimes some parts I think that the Catholic Church needs to evolve with humans with our mentalities not everything needs to change because they're I mean the basic tenets are still about being good, but things a lot of things that are rules are based on like you said money and power and does the Catholic Church really need more money and power? Does any religion really need to be the only like it I don't know I don't know where I'm going with that I lost my brain stopped\n",
        "It's awful that that's the truth, but I mean I also have friends in the military  a lot of his buddies have died over in Iraq  but I don' t think it's worth it at this point for people to continue dying  I mean I don't necessarily think they died in vain  I mean we fought the good fight but I mean the time is up   nothing  whatever goal we set out to accomplish has just been hazed over and it just seems to be like the same situation for the past like few months and it's just not getting anywhere  so I think it's time for us to get out of there.\n\nWe didn't lose as many, is that what you're saying?\n\nWe didn't  proportionally we haven't lost as many soldiers  is that what you're saying?\n\nWell we're not  I mean  I don't know\n\nYeah.\n\nI think also that it's a lot  with Iraq kinda went under the cloud of 9-11  Afghanistan  alright take any person off the street  why did we go into Iraq?  Al-Kaida, 9-11! Terrorism!  What?  There's no like  like the whole WMD  I mean \n\nWell I mean who knows. It's all hearsay. They coulda like moved them  or once they didn't have them there anymore  I mean what were we doing there? That's kinda silly for me.\n\nI mean well of course we don't  ya know  that's the way it should be\n\nSee, like, that's the thing.  For the longest time I was for the war and then actually everything just kept on stacking up and all the things that kept on happening  it just wore me down and at this point  I'm not at a point where I can just stand up for the war anymore  and it's not like  it's not like the liberal media or any other person like forced my decision  it's not like  no one converted me  it just got to the point where I was just so sick and tired of hearing like too many bad things for every good thing we do over there\n\nYeah, but  there's kids my age that are dead  people  kids shouldn't be over there dying at this point I don't think\n\nYeah, but\n\nYeah, at this point  yeah\n\nThat's a good point. Yeah, if a soldier like ran into a burning building to save a baby or something like that  like something like that \n\nYeah\n\nIt's just  some of the stuff like really hits home because like over the summer I had that job  that one kid that was over in Iraq  he uh joined before 9-11  and he's from Iraq originally so he kinda had his own like personal reasons for bein over there  so  he went back after  he was part of operation storm Baghdad  he was part of like the front line  like right after 9-11  well right after they went into Iraq, excuse me  and um  he went back again  talking to the kid, and we're on our way to work and I noticed he's like smoking a pack of cigarettes  and I'm like oh you smoke when did you start doing that?  and he's like well I got a carton for a buddy, but he died  and it's just like damn  like it's just to the point where like  I don't know  it shouldn't be like that  it's not worth it to me anymore\n\nNo, it's not like lack of enthusiasm. It's just like people  American kids I mean are dying\n\nWell I mean it'd be different if we were like  I don't know  I don't think  in the long run, I don't think it's gonna be worth it to get involved anymore\n\nWell but also like with that  you're making a good point   I mean we're sending kids over seas to die  they've got the home field advantage and they're ready to like do whatever it takes  I'm not gonna fall into the stereotypes but they're willin to do whatever it takes to get us out  and win  and like they I mean it's just like we're over there and like we see some video of marines or army dudes throw a flash ring at a flock of sheep as they're like driving by in Iraq  I mean they're kids  I mean they're like playing games over there  I mean I don't know  I just  the more of what I see over there  there's a certain extent of things they do to keep themselves sane and to kinda let loose but some of the actions they have done over there  I mean the whole thing with the marines and shooting up the village  that's awful  I mean  does everyone know about that?  like there's a \n\nNaa. It was a big news story. It was over the summer  and even my  my um marine buddy  he said definitely does not look good  a bunch of marines like crapped and shot up a whole town complete with women and kids  it was all over the news  I wish I had \n\nIt was not a valid reason.  I'm not gonna continue cause I don't know the  I can't be like talking out my behind  but it's just so much scandal  and for everything we don't know about that goes good  there's probably just as much stuff we don't know about that goes on bad over there\n\nWell I don't know if that would hold true cause if there was no negative  I mean why not?\n\nWell, yeah  I mean it's like why or why not?  That's the big question, but there's overwhelming\n\nEven when I wanted  like when I was supporting the war  it's like even the people who were supporting the war weren't too completely revamped the way we're doing things over there  I mean they train the Iraqi policemen  what was it like 2months?  It's like you're in and then you're out, now go police the streets  I mean it's they don't have enough time to actually  and I mean if it was at the beginning of the war I'd be like sure let's like take a minute and sit down and really devise  but I mean we're already too far into it where it's just too late man  I don't know  it's too late man  but that's the way I feel about that\n\nYeah, yeah  that's the one thing  I mean there is a very valid point  I mean if we do pull out now  we're sending like\n\nWell, yeah  we're saying like yeah the terrorists have won  I mean I hate to over-generalize and use this parallel, but the same thing with Vietnam  I know it's overused and used incorrectly a lot of the times but it's appropriate in this case where like it's just time to say we cannot progress any further without substantial like kickback\n\nWell if the bad doesn't\n\nWell, they'd still hate him but\n\nWell no  like\n\nAnd it's not just the war though\n\nAre you kidding me?\n\nNaa  you keep talking about the economy\n\nAnd even more than the economy  I mean you need  you can't even like\n\nHe like drove out  Bush drove two private companies into the ground  bankrupt before he even became President  he also drove his car into a telephone pole drunk\n\nThat's a point, but even at the end of Clinton  I mean the bubble's about to burst  I mean you can only have economic prosperity for such a long time  but I don't really think with the war and everything  he didn't really help that much anyways  it's not the same thing like in after 9-11 everyone's like storm Iraq  or storm Afghanistan  find those expletives  it's not the same \n\nNo, man.\n\nI'd  I'd just well\n\nWell, no  I mean  like she's  I don't know  like with the whole thing  I'm from Connecticut  so there's the whole thing with Joe Lieberman running  as opposed to Ned Lamont  Ned Lamont, yeah  the guy's like some  I   yeah, he was running under the whole slogan of actually bringing our troops back  which is  even like in this discussion  I mean that's not a bad idea  but that's kinda like all he  all he was about  and so like  he won  he was  he actually won the democratic primary but then Joe ran as an Independent and won  I believe  I think that's how it worked  yeah I think that's how it worked  but um   when they were asking Hilary  cause like Bill Clinton  he's like oh yeah I'm gonna support Joe no matter what  and they asked Hilary who would you support  like depending on who wins the primary  she's like I'll support whoever  whoever wins the Democratic primary  and I mean stuff like that is just not  as a moderate I really don't see a big deal about  I mean party politics are strong to some extent  but you shouldn't let that define  I mean just cause someone's a Democrat  that shouldn't  you shouldn't like rally behind \nBush  that's relevant\n\nAnd that's all I have to say about that.\n\nDo you  when George Washington was just a small boy  he had a cherry tree  he chopped down that cherry tree\n \nIt's not  it's not even as he needs to pull the troops  if he does something and like drastically revives the way  I mean it still  it still might not convert other people  but \n\nAt least he's doing something  I mean he's just kinda yeah send em over\n\nI don't think it'd be very smart for a President just to come out and say oops I messed up  cause I mean to some extent he is the leader and\n\nBut there's a sly way he could be doing that\n\nThere's a sly way you could like change things so that the political analysts and such could go in and say hey he apologized to us without even saying anything\n\nRight. Yeah, exactly. Well I was just saying that'd be more along the lines  if it's not him saying he messed up  it's good enough for most if he does that\n\nThat's  that wouldn't be a smart move at all\n \nA lot of them don't believe that this is all for nothing like he was saying earlier  but I mean it's a point where like \n\nYeah  I mean like there  like  it's a shame  cause like as I was saying my buddy  my buddy like all his friends are dyin over  I mean it's a shame because me and my other friend  we can't talk to him about the Iraq war cause I mean we have these certain like opinions and it would just like upset him so much  no question  I mean he has his own reasons cause I mean he was born in Iraq and like he came over here when he was like a little tot  and like now he's  but like  as for like Joe American  I don't think they have that like vendetta or whatever you would call it to go back and set things right in a foreign country where they have never been before\n\nYeah\n\nUm \n\nI don't know  I mean like he  his Dad  he says his Dad when he was over there  uh   he was a dentist  and like he  this is a funny thing  he got like a letter from Saddam saying like keep up the good work, you're being a good dentist Like  so that's like the one funny thing he has  and then um \n\nYeah it was  I don't know  it just always struck me as funny  but um no I don't think they um  he actually was scared  he didn't even tell his parents he was going over to Iraq the second time  yeah  they don't know  cause they  yeah\n\nYeah, about that  um \n\nWell, no, cause he thinks that like he's going back and freeing his people\n\nYeahhh  like his brother  like hates him  I mean that really  even within his family  that's a  again we really didn't get into it cause \n\nYeah  that's like sayin like so I heard your sister had an abortion  like how's your folks dealing with that  like  it like  it's not something that uh  something to make light of at all  like I just did.\n\nNope\n\n\n\n",
        " Right\n\n I think I've written down the same comment for this ten times at least\n\n I hate this topic, I'm sorry I'm just gonna throw that out in the beginning of this, but\n\nCause I just think it's stupid like we're talking about all these really like important controversial issues, and like freedom of speech obviously is important\n\n Yeah\n\n Phone conversations are a lot more private than \n\n Well, inherently they are more private than Myspace you put stuff on Myspace for people to see, but you don't\n\n Well that that's like all um I think I'm thinking about this more in terms of like if you're doing controversial things if you're having you're calling somebody to plan a to plan a attack to plan a terrorist attack or and you're also posting it on your Myspace\n\n Right, but you know what I'm saying like the Myspace you have to watch very carefully what you put on there if you don't know that everybody's gonna be looking at it but you're putting stuff on there so people do look at it but, when you call your mom or your dad to tell him you got a bad grade\n\n I mean, it shouldn't be you're calling your mom or your dad you're not calling um the rest of the people in the world to tell them to look at your site\n\n I live off campus.\n\n I'm above the school already like\n\n That's a private that's your house\n\n Mmhmm.\n\n Yup\n\n Mmhmm.\n\n At our school uh, here the athletic director um, Joe Boyland has a Facebook account, and he looks at all of our pictures you can get in a lot of trouble if he sees anything like people smoking or drinking if their not 21 you know so like they do it happens here like just as \n\n These kids here\n\n Well, this is the same thing as an employer because a lot of kids here that can get checked by the athletic director are making uh 35,000 dollars a year technically\n\n Oh, yeah cause they're going to Loyola which is 42,000 dollars a year for like six, seven thousand dollars it's called their scholarship\n\n Right so those kids can lose lots and lots of money because they're taking a beer pong and Boyland has a Facebook account and um sees them\n\n What's your Professor's name?\n\n How old is he?\n\n Oh, one of the chem. professors here came over to have dinner with us he was a very out there guy\n\n I don't know, I don't remember his name.\n\n Yeah, that's gotta be it.\n\n Yes, he does.\n\n Sorry about that off the record\n\n Like what the strippers do?\n\n Ok\n\n Just trying to understand what you're talking about.\n \n Yeah, I mean you represent your company or whatever your school\n\n That's acceptable, right?\n\n They were going to, but then I don't know what happened they didn't so I'm not friends with the girl personally um and it happened right after I graduated so I I know I went to school I talked to my principal I know the story from a nun, so I don't know which twist I'm getting, but like still the point of the matter is they expelled her for something that seems like a minor infraction, but when it comes to the Myspace situation with the shooting it seems like it's a good thing so almost it's kind of like a double-edged sword kind of thing with the privacy it's really I mean how much privacy is there really in America or in the world? nowadays anyway\n\n You actually preach more community you know than\n\n Yeah, but we go to a 3,300 kid school you see the same people all the time everybody knows each other privacy here is just not an option in general\n\n I mean listen like I know, listen like obviously there's Penn State and then there's Loyola \n\n You know everyone in your class too, you just have more of like a high school you know the kids in your class you've spoken to them I mean there's many classes at many universities where you don't even talk\n \n So it is you.\n\n Are you saying public schools?\n\n You all aren't saying the same thing then.\n\n Mmhmm Well, I guess if school's teachers and principals and guidance counselors and everything they invest a lot of their time and who they are you know into the students, and they want if students upbringing is gonna be dependent on these different administrative individuals then, um who is to say that it shouldn't that it is Ok then, right? for them to want to check up and make sure that they're on the right path it's almost like it's just another way of I mean, and if they're doing something inherently bad you know and they find out it's also their responsibility to make sure that kid doesn't do that and get in trouble and go down the wrong path\n\n And do the wrong thing so I think I guess it's Ok to have a level um a certain amount of inspection and, and, and less privacy I guess\n\n No, I agree.\n\n I've been at Loyola since ten, I kind of want to go home. \n\n No\n\n That's like the whole isn't that what makes like Facebook the Myspace like completely ridiculous like interaction and and privacy like you subscribe and throw that out the door when you sign up to those things\n\n Sure, and everybody has different needs for it, but it's completely like like revolutionized college\n\n I mean, I don't know like what it was like um because like when I was um I guess a freshman was the first time that Facebook came out\n\n I'm a junior here.\n\n So, like I'm the first class of completely Facebook\n\n Oh absolutely I\n\n Right, right\n\n Yeah\n\n Sure well, it served more of a direct purpose now, I mean I mean now it's kind of like a \n\n Yeah, it is.\n\n I think that's the next step, so I'm assuming that's the next step\n\n I mean I God, I hate at first I I mean I have uh a Facebook account per say, but like it was like it was almost like a slap in the face to what what is college you go from where you were comfortable to not and you knew everybody .to going to a spot where you have to go up to somebody and like meet them\n\n You get these groups like Loyola 2009 or 2008 or whatever and you have faces and you know what they like and \n\n But you've never met them yeah there's no interaction\n\n It's completely just changed.\n\n I mean we pillow talk all the time.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "I think it still is an issue but um I think it was more of an issue in the past and like nowadays it's not as widespread\n \nWhat kind of job was it?\n\n A lot of times well the one of the main problems I have with this entire issue is like a lot of time there'll be situations where people will say that it's gender discrimination like in some decision that some employer makes or whatever but I mean how can you know that there aren't other factors to take into that like I mean how can you be so sure that it's just because of gender? that a certain like decision was made I mean in certain decisions where it's so like obvious then like then I would definitely say discriminating against gender is like wrong but I think most situations you can't really say for sure\n\nOr it could just be arbitrary I mean if you're going if there's a man against a woman and they have the same skill set if you know if they choose one the other could yell gender discrimination but I mean it was just an arbitrary decision\n\nBut that is the same job? It's not because of different\n\nI also think its kind of important having a Mom that's there to stay home and take care of the kids. I mean I think like like kids nowadays these like little five year-olds that run around with like cell phones and everything are just like kids that are dropped off at the day-care at like six o'clock and picked up at eight at night\n\nYeah\n\nWell, also I feel I mean I don't know if this is gender discrimination, but I mean I feel that women are more like suited like naturally to care for like the young or the children or whatever\n\nLike I mean like a kid I mean kids when they grow up they want mommy like you know? it's not like\n\nI feel like if a man were to try to take that role like oh, I'm gonna stay home and take care of the kids it'd just be like everyone would say he's a deadbeat and has to go get a job and\n\nWhat do you guys think about like the feminist movement like in general?\n\nI'm not sure like for sure but to me it seems like feminists are trying to like close the gap between like the differences between like men and women almost trying to like make them equal like exactly and I think that like that's kind of a dangerous \n\nEven like a dangerous thing to approach I mean \n\nYeah\n\nThat too\n\nSo, I think uh  it's shown that like men are better at math and women are better at like kind alike analytical problems \n\nEspecially with the whole conflict in the Middle East right now, I mean \n\nHow women are treated there is terrible\n\nYeah, that would be really bad for us.\n\nWell, what do you mean by like a man's perspective?\n\nMy Mom herself believes that she doesn't want to see a woman president\n\nThe U.S. is just like too hot right now with all issues and we're too spread out all over the world in too many different conflicts. I mean England I think was I mean I'm not you know a big history buff but I feel as thought England was a lot more passive than like we are like now\n\nOh of course, yeah\n\nEspecially in a country like America where everybody's so different, and on so many different pages.\nGender discrimination wasn't even an issue until like fifty years ago until people started being like hey\n \nThe job is done.\n\nAlso with the feminist movement I'm not sure if this is entirely true, but it seems to me that like the connotation of like a typical feminist like focuses more on like a hatred for like the male than like trying to help like females as into raise their position\n \nIt's kinds just like trends that have developed over time like I mean it's not like the male as like a conscious collective decided to just discriminate against women I mean like we said like from the beginning of time the male has always had that position as like the you know the alpha going out and getting the food and the stuff like that\n\nYeah, there are no solid laws that you can really like put it cause like I mean what we said before where I mean you can't really tell whether it's discrimination against gender it's never so clear-cut like that where you can just say for sure\n\nAnd also you know it's people on their own that have to or women or men that are on their own that have to take those I guess women mostly for the jobs have to I mean like we said anyone coming into the school could go become an engineer\n\nI could see how the courts could be more in favor of giving women the kids because if I had like my kid and I was giving it to like a day care  and there were just like two people that were exactly the same standing next to each other and one's a man and one's a woman I mean I would want the woman to take care of my kid just cause I don't know I feel like women are more like I don't know better suited to take care of kids than men are more natural\n\nYeah\n",
        "Do you like memorize these questions?\n\nI think things like we talked about gay marriage before a lot of people are for it, but the Catholic Church isn't and if the catholic church were they'd probably be fine with it. So, maybe that's one aspect where they could just generally go more with the 21st century view of things.\n\nI think the beliefs are fine, but it's more of like how they practice them.\n\nWell, I don't know it's just the Catholic Church reputation for being like close-minded.\n \nWell I mean that's the problem with like every religion I think. People just cling to a part of it until it really [inaudible]\n\nBut there's more to being a catholic than\n\nA lot of people think that since they go to church every weekend like they're set. But, that's also another way you can misinterpret it.\n\nBut, you do other things\n\nSo you think it's like a more personality thing?\n \nWhat do you mean by fundamentalist Christian? \n\nLike Catholics? Extreme Catholics?\n\nDo they claim to be Catholic though?\n\nI feel like in views like that like more political views like gay marriage, abortion, things like that if the catholic church has to change their views on that then every other denomination has to change their views on that.\n\nSo\n\nSo when it says like change their ways I feel like they are referring to priesthood, and priests not being able to marry and no women priests things like that\n\nYeah well I'm just saying I feel like change your ways can't apply to like principles stuff like that Cause then like every person in the world that feels that gays shouldn't be allowed to marry has to change the way they think about it ya know?\n\nI mean basically our society is moving towards gender equality and women's rights and things like that but\n\nOk to have Catholicism opposed to that seems like counterproductive towards society's rules so\nDon't you think less and less people will become Catholic?\n\nBut then\n\nThat's just because our society's so accepting of women and if other things change in out society like we become more accepting of gay marriage then we'd probably want the catholic church to change it\n\nBut then honestly I don't think it's like taking away from the religion that women can't be priests. That may be sexist but I'm a girl and I don't think that women should be priests\n\nYeah kind of\n\nYeah, I mean I think it's like unfair to the women that want to be priests but I don't think like it's gonna bring like\n\nYeah but I don't think that it would necessarily bring anything more to\n\nYeah\n\nYeah, but to combat it the only thing to do would be to let women be priests [inaudible]\n\nIf it took that long for the catholic church to change that aspect I think\n\nI think women priests is a whole different can of worms.\n\nAnd I mean even in the bible in the old testament the person that was considered a priest is one who gives a sacrifice for a community and like all you hear about is men in the bible that did that.\n\nSo obviously, if the catholic church is gonna base their practice on what is biblical and what is biblical obviously men are head of the family they are head of most things\n\nThat was the problem with the Protestant church. \n\nI mean it could have helped like honestly you don't' know but like at the same time there are men that are married that still are like pedophiles so\n\nIt's a contributing factor\n\nYeah I feel like it's more at the fault of the Priest than it is with the religion cause\n\nBecause if you have those feelings anyways then you have no business being a priest.\n\nAny psych majors? diathesis-stress model?\n\nUm it's you inherit the risk of developing a psychological disorder and it may or may not be triggered by the environment. So obviously priesthood would be the nurturing environment\n\nNo, you're predisposed towards pedophilia not towards priesthood.\n\nThat would\n\nSo changing that one point of view it would attract more people to priesthood but then it would be sacrificing one of the principles of the religion\n",

I feel like I feel like in that case it was important to go and look for them because if we had found them we woulda been like nice saved ourselves so we looked and around and we didn't have them they didn't have them which is kind of not you know I don't know I feel like it was important because we could have just turned our backs on it and then what could have happened?\n\n[S1] Yeah, they were probably dismantled, if anything.\n\n[S1] I feel like if they coulda done and I don't have any good examples but like if they coulda done I feel like they coulda helped them in another way I mean obviously getting rid of Saddam was like the biggest step ever and then maybe not implementing a democracy, but implementing some certain rights or giving them sort of government maybe is there like a more basic government system they could have tried to employ?\n\n[S1] I never thought about it like that.\n\n[S1] Yeah, I was gonna say didn't it become a revolutionary war? \n\n[S1] Also being the most powerful we see a country that's just so weak and then I mean obviously if we think about it we're like oh a country that's not doing so well, given them a democracy like it does seem like if you don't think any further than that like democracy works out well let's give them one of those like it does seem like a pretty good idea until you try and think of how you do it and I think I think that's why because they I mean it's been, what two years that we've been there?\n\n[S1] Three?\n\n[S1] Four? Great but I'm ya know but it just keeps I just feel like why they've still had to be there because they're realizing it didn't work out exactly how they planned\n\n[S1] And then we'd have to do it again.\n\n[S1] What he would do\n\n[S1] Yeah\n\n[S1] I mean even I have a friend who's on his second time over in Iraq now and he's over there now and they told him that he doesn't know when he's coming back and all those sorts of things and I mean as much as they're fighting and it's obviously what they believe in What is it anymore? Like what are they exactly fighting for? and obviously you're trying to fight for the best for that country but even what I don't even know if we know what we're doing anymore\n\n[S1] Like I don't I mean obviously I'm not when he gets home I'm not gonna bring up the war, but I don't even know if they would know exactly what they're fighting for in just in direct terms of that whereas do we know what we're fighting for anymore?\n\n[S1] Especially then when they didn't really have a choice.\n\n[S1] Right\n\n[S1] I mean, yeah, and that's why we've always in a lot of the past wars that you feel like people are successful because they're fighting for what they believe in they're fighting for what they love they're fighting for what they think is right. How are you fighting when you don't know what you're fighting for? When you don't really know what you're doing everyday by going out and waking up and risking your life\n\n[S1] It's not gonna make anymore sense now.\n\n[S1] I agree. It's easy for us to talk, but we don't actually\n\n[S1] Right\n\n[S1] Good luck with that.\n\n[S1] It's definitely an option. I never really thought about it in that respect.\n\n[S1] Right\n\n[S1] And it's also and it's also why we're hoping it becomes like obsolete by then you know with all like they're trying to get our cars to run on vegetable oil I mean and this is like you know getting ridiculous but I mean if not that a hundred years is a long time but if the end of it is in a hundred years hopefully we have another I mean they've only really started to do this I'm sure people have worked on it for a long time, but really a lot you've only heard about it in the last couple of years and we've made some you know some better\n\n[S1] I mean how big could they be making if they're gonna keep working on it you know?\n\n[S1] But even if it becomes something no, I mean I definitely think it'll become something that the government can make money on but, if it's something we're not gonna run out on in the next one hundred years I'm for it you know, if it's something that is gonna be an alternative to oil and we don't have anymore oil\n\n[S1] I mean that's a ridiculous amount of people.\n\n[S1] And I think that it's also a lot of people who I mean as we all agree we really couldn't come up with a main like reason for the war and I think that's a lot of it too is what makes it even worse because then you hear things like that you're like oh man and they send more people over there and we're not even doing anything but, if there was a clear goal in sight and these people were working towards something then I don't know if there'd be any objection I mean there would obviously be objection to having people over there, but not as much if you thought there was a clear goal in sight but that's what makes people more angry about it is that they're not even sure what they're fighting for much less why there's so many\n\n[S1] I mean, you'd think.\n \n[S1] He acts like we don't have a TV.\n \n[S1] I think what his motivation needs to be is looking at other problems like North Korea and things like that and kind of focusing on what could be in the future instead of going on I mean not to say that we didn't I mean the argument about if we had to be in Iraq or not like we were there we are there it's happened but now at this point in time the argument is like stay there or go and I mean we do have so many people there that even take some of them you know like move some of them and I mean I think we have to realize that there are bigger threats out there right now because Iraq is not a threat to us right now really like so much and that we need to realize that there are other threats to us\n \n[S1] I kind of agree leave it as a stand-still \n \n[S1] I think a lot of it is he's not worried about re-election he's not worried about I mean not to say this is not his main motivation but he's not worried about re-election he's not worried about anything like that so I think he's going I think he's gonna say that he's just doing it for the way that he can be like no, it's fine everything's ok I believe that I mean there has to be a part of him that believes that they're doing something cause he wouldn't just be leavin em there you're right you're not gonna leave all of your American soldiers over there for no reason and they're getting hurt everyday but, I think there's definitely so he has to believe it somehow but, I think a lot of it is there's not really a motivation for him to have to make a decision right now cause it's like you said I mean it's kind of like fifty-fifty because if he leaves them there, there's gonna be half the people that want them back, but if he takes them out then it could be something worse\n\n[S1] He woulda been exactly but if it was such a simple decision, it woulda been done\n\n[S1] He does. I mean he's gotta know something.\n\n[S1] What he should be doing so he's gotta be thinking that this is something he has to think that it's best to keep people there or he wouldn't be\n\n[S1] Right, he's not like let's ruin America like that's not why like I really can't see I mean sure people don't like him but I really don't think it's a conspiracy theory like him against the world\n\n[S1] And then it also becomes an issue of what do you do then if taking them out's not if taking them out's not the answer and leaving them there is making everything not so good then ok like what does that mean?\n\n[S1] There's gotta be a solution. I think that could also be part of it. He has to believe that there's some reason they're there but also it could be so even if he started to believe that we shouldn't be there, what should we do? what is he gonna do with them? gonna make a human wall around the country? like there's nothing to do with them like he can't win either way basically\n\n[S1] Right\n\n[S1] I think something needs to be done and I don't think now is the time, and I don't know what to be done is to be done so I don't know I mean that was just like not needed to be said actually but you know I don't know if there's anything something needs to be done, but we don't know what it is and they don't know what it is or I feel it woulda been done\n\n[S1] Focus on other things that we need to be worried about.\n\n[S1] Cause ultimately, they are the ones that know everything it's not us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "You have to know that anything you're posting on the internet can and will be found by someone there's very few things even if you delete it off of a website like Myspace or Facebook, it's still not on the internet somewhere it never disappears it's always out there\n\nRight, but with a post or something like that \n\nYeah, like on Myspace or something like that I know the bulletins when you make them it goes to anyone who's your friend can see it, and a lot of people don't have restrictions on who can see it so if you're putting it out there like you kinda have to know that anyone could see it\n\nI think it's the kind of thing for appropriate reason I don't know if necessarily like I hope they don't have enough time to go on every student's webpage and try to see what exactly what they're saying about everyone you know that would be a ridiculous job but, if it's for something where someone brings it to their attention that there was a threat or there was something like that then then like you say it was public information and anyone could see it, so \n\nNo, it's ok.\n\nYes\n\nThere's like a certain way I think it works the certain way is that you can have a limited profile where like you can only see the person's name and where they're from and their main picture, but you can limit it to but then most people don't limit it anyone in the entire world can see it\n\nYeah\n\nAbsolutely not so it goes kinda along the same way as if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it like don't type it either you know like all those sort of things anything you have to expect that like everyone and like their mother can see your anything you write ever on the internet so you have to know that before you post anything you have to almost wonder if the guy with the school shooting was like looking to get caught putting a bulletin up on Myspace being like I'm gonna shoot the school up you kinda have to wonder if he was looking to get caught\n \nLike if it's brought to their attention like someone was probably like, hey I read something about our school getting um you know somebody shooting up our school then sure, check it out but I don't know if you necessarily need to spend all your free time looking at your students and trying to figure out what they're doing wrong\n \nBut, I I agree I think they did do that because I mean any of it I guess is like evidence, but I think it's also that when you're getting in trouble for something they can use that as evidence I don't know if necessarily they were just like, oh today I'm gonna look up this person and then call you and be like, haha I hope you had a good weekend I'm gonna get you in trouble now so I think it's something that they use it as kind of a tool for proof and evidence but I don't know if they're necessarily searching for it cause I don't know if you should necessarily be looking it's like looking for trouble I mena like I don't know [inaudible] you just need to know what you're putting out there you need to know if you post a picture of something that's not exactly right then you should know that people can see it\n\nProbably not, how many times ya gonna believe that one? Um, they've also said that some places um  like check up on you on Facebook and like Myspace if you have a job.\n\nIf they're hiring you for a job\n\nAnd, they'll like kinda check out What do we think about that?\n\nUm, some places when you go to apply for a job they'll look you up on Facebook or Myspace and kinda look at all that kinda stuff how do you feel about that?\n\nI'm not sure how it works, I just heard they that some companies I mean maybe someone has a Facebook account or has a Myspace account and will kinda type your name in and see if \n\nRight, depends on your network and again it depends on if you're being safe about it and only having your friends view it, or if everyone can view it.\n\nI agree, like from nine to five I'll do what you ask me to do.\n\nRight\n\nBut, I don't know if that's if they're necessarily checking for a rapist\n\nYeah, like what are they gonna say? You drink too much? It's like, thanks mom. You know like thanks for checking up on me\n\nI think that's an extreme case though.\n\nPictures of him in like the back store room searching through all their stuff.\n\nI feel like for the I feel like you have your job from nine to five and then afterwards after five it's kind of your time and like you said as long as you're of age you do what you gotta do just be ready to go to work at nine again\n\nAnd not be drinking during the day or you know anything like that and then I don't really know if they it was surprising to me though that a lot of companies would care cause I guess I agree with you that like you represent the company, but at the same time you can't tell me like the big bosses in the company don't have a good time on the weekends [laughter] you know so you don't almost I don't know \n\n[Laughter] where they go make their phone calls\n\nThe way I see it I mean if it's one of those kind of things where like you said why do you have to listen to my conversations with my Mom but, if I'm talking to my Mom and we're talking about what happened to me that day like first of all they're not listening, but if I happen to say the word bomb to my Mom and they do start listening if they're not gonna necessarily find anything by me and I'm not gonna really be saying anything about being a terrorist because I'm not but, if this program can even catch one terrorist and so you ahd to listen to me tell my Mom about a test I had then like isn't that worth it? you know, if we can catch even one person more than we would have even without listening to phone calls at what the risk of them having hear me talk about my weekend then I don't care\n\nRight, and if they find that it works and they can really catch them or stop something from happening from this then go for it.\n\nBut, then again I feel like half the conversations that I have I don't even want to listen to them much less someone else listening to them and I mean most of the things and that's why cause I do understand it's like the whole feeling of like is someone seeing me right now? Like is someone listening to me? Why do you have to you know why do you have to always feel like you're being watched?  But, at the same time, I'm not gonna do anything wrong, so go ahead listen to me talk for hours on the phone about anything you know as long as im not gonna and I agree with you, as long as it's nto gonna be used like somehow against me anything that I say as long as it has that one purpose then go for it catch that one person\n\nAnd, I mean they definitely weren't like ever thinking that there'd be a way to tap phone conversations and I mean first of all\n\nAnd they were never thinking that there could be a way people would be able to have their private conversations  uh  I don't know cause I agree with you on how like why are we even violating that right basically but, at the same time\n\nRight, exactly I'm all for if you can stop comething from happening or catch one person then you know it's worth having you to worth me feeling cause honestly I don't sit around and like wow, wish I had more privacy on the phone it's like one of those things that doesn't really effect me so whether it's happening or not try to catch someone like stop something from happening then I'll be ok with it\n\nI mean yeah, but I mean when you and it might be racial profiling like they could see it as that, but again like they're not gonna track all the calls from here to Wisconsin because I mean what are the chances?\n\nAnd, so obviously like the ones that they're gonna be listening more for are those kinda calls to and from the Middle East or those calls so it's kinda like well I'm just trying to call back home.\n\nYou know, like I'm trying to call my family or trying to call somebody I know there and then you're being listened to just based on that one reason. But again, I mean kind of how are you gonna how else would they do it? Like you know if that's where they're finding that these terrorists are coming from then again like it is reality you're not gonan track they would be wasting time tracking from here to Alaska it wouldn't make any sense they need to kind of you know\n",
        "Well\n\nWhereas you actually you know you sign an agreement you know for Myspace\n\nWell, here's the question, well this specific topic at least involves school officials looking at Myspace web pages now can is it acceptable for school officials to tap kids' phones?\n \nI was was thinking of high school like home phones\n\nCause let's say I mean I don't know how they uh  if this well I mean if the student's doing it from a computer, you know when they're home you know posting this Myspace or whatever[inaudible] can they tape their phones?\n\nYeah, anyone can\n\nYeah\n\nExpelled?\n\nThat's I went I went to an all-girls, Catholic high-school too and there was this similar situation in that the girl's um which was stupid of them, but they were looking at these photos on a school computer\n\nOn someone's Myspace and it was pictures of you know some of the girls drinking and, um uh and so the school can access all the websites that you go to on the school computer and so the principal saw this and I can't believe they actually expelled the girl but, they just they just called the parents and told them about it\n\nWhat school did you go to?\n\nThe [inaudible] look at it\n\nSame thing\n\nWhat do you have any idea\n\nWhat she exactly said?\n\nI mean that has to be considered because that's probably what the situation is like the example with you know preventing a school shooting is probably the same thing as I'm going to go kill someone so you have to investigate that I think\n\nThen you'd have like an F.B.I. official at every house in America.\n\nSorry, you were doing that\n\nYeah\n\nWell, yeah its public information I mean \n\nI'm curious, what did uh  did she her family take any kind of action against the school?\n\nWell really in a school you know privacy really isn't a very important thing the important thing is you know education and safety\n\nI think at least in terms of a school, safety is more important in my opinion\n \nYou're talking about the internet?\n\nWas there some kind of warrant for that, to, to\n\nI mean  well but I mean that's kind of like searching someone's house too they don't need their permission as long as they have a warrant\n\nWell\n\nNo, no please\n\nI mean, I think same thing with searching the house if there's a legitimate suspicion for it and they do get some sort of warrant for it, then it's acceptable but, I think that they should know about it the same rules should apply to a situation like searching someone's house\n\nNo, I do. \n\nI understand, but then also just I mean to talk about this specific topic of the school I think that safety is more important than privacy\n\nWell, yeah.\n\nI think\n\nI think it needs to be sanctioned by like a court order.\n\nWell, usually the courts\n\nWell, I guess the courts don't establish a standard, kind of like they, they\n\nThen I guess that's the way it is for that. I guess that's the way it should be for unless someone can think of something better\n\nI know, but I think the things about the problem is you can't really standardize like individual it's never gonna be standardized because individual cases are so different\nI mean I don't think the government and the executive branch by itself has the right to tap people's phones.\n\nRight. \n\nI mean in terms of I don't know in terms of schools like I know people I think it was my junior year we had a lock down drill and the school brought in cops and dogs to sniff out drugs in people's lockers \n\nI mean, and you know a lot I mean a lot of people complained about that and were angry about that, but I thought about it and it's school property I mean the school has the right to do whatever really search whatever it's school property the locker isn't your property, it's the school's property and so \n\nUnless, unless you give unless you give the government reason uh\n\nTo take away your rights, which once again I think comes down to with what we were talking about with warrants and things like that.\n\nWhat was the original question?\n\nYeah I mean internet public space school officials, part of the public\n\nNo\n\nYeah\n\nFreshman\n\nI know I get people from my old high school who I never talk to a day in my life like trying to friend me\n\nOh, I can't do that. I can only do two.\n\nNo, they can't do it.\n\nMy grandma does that actually my grandma has a screen name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "I'll go um I'm number twenty. alright well uh the way I've always viewed it if you actually look at the definition of marriage it's the union between a man and a woman, and I'm not opposed to gay people being together or anything but um I just don't think it should be called a marriage exactly I think it should be a legal union or something of the sort um so like that way it obviously wouldn't be um wouldn't be like referred to as a marriage within the church or anything uh which is that's the way marriages start out then they become legalized like when the judges started doing it and um what do you guys think about that? I think it should be more of like a definition type thing.\n\nDo you think it would hinder their lifestyle if it was not called a marriage?\n\nWhy wouldn't they be happy?\n\nUm can you clarify\n\nYeah go into a little more detail\n\nAlright yeah that's what I was trying to get at just making sure at the same level there\n\nWhat ya could do ya know is for the people who ya know wanna be involved with the church you can be married within the church but also be married make it legal as well\n\nWell it doesn't.\n\nYa know so like there's no change in that.\n\nEspecially Benny D.\n\nBenedict as our Pope right now.\n\nIt's definitely against Catholicism\n\nIn the catholic church?\n \nGung-ho or something?\n\nCause it's not really involved in your life\n\nAre they catholic?\n\nWell I know two gay catholic people I've never talked to them about it though so it's not gonna help.\n\nI think there's always gonna be like a little portion a little portion of the catholic church the followers that is never the leaders but that would definitely think it would be alright but it would always be the majority that would most likely be against it I feel.\nYou went from the extreme to the extreme\n \nWhere exactly is everybody from? I'm not sure if you guys had said that or not. You're from Alabama originally. I'm from Maryland\n\nAlright so we got we got the full spectrum here.\n\nIt's all political to me I mean jeez everything's freakin political nowadays like as sad as that is but that's really what it comes down to  is politics Does anybody want to add on to that? Because I think that would make a terrific thing to add on to.\n\nI have nothing to back that up.\n\nCause like I feel like there's those people such as myself um I am a Republican but I sure as heck don't follow everything Republicans follow ya know like ya know generally a lot of youth nowadays joins a party just because their parents are in that party. Like for instance my mom's only republican because she's against abortion stuff like that uh that's a huge contributor to why I am a republican cause ya know I'm against abortion But ya know that'd be like that isolated thing where like ya know you follow that stuff\n\nYou also got the border states. Maryland is a border state.\n\nBut then like if you think about it then like goin back to the civil war ya know when you had the confederacy it'll just be like those southern states will just have one general view whereas the northern states will have another view\n\nWe'll just go after everybody and like it'll just be hell in a handbasket.\n\nI don't even think it should be a state issue I think like you said it should be an individual issue um well I think it should be an individual issue like I don't think government should be tied in at all\n\nYeah, ya know it's I, I, don't want it to be called a marriage because that's a union of a union between a man and a women well in the dictionary too like legally if you wanna say that that's right now as a fact that's what marriage is like that's what it says by fact but ya know I don't know I just feel as though it should be called something else feel very strongly about that.\n\nSends it out by dove.\n\nIt's just fun to make fun of the guy.\n\nGo back to the topic though. Does anybody have any feelings about anything else? I feel like everything was kinda already thrown out there. And like gay marriage leads to abortion, leads to?\n\nAlright, that's cool.\nOr Richard something from Survivor One the guy who walked around nude yeah he has a son I don't know maybe we can talk about the gay people that we do know and maybe their feelings on this how about that?\n\nWell obviously yeah\n\nYeah very close-minded on the Bush issue and you can't blame them.\n\nSo you said, your gay friends were atheist?\n\nYou said you have a lot of gay friends?\n\nAre they religious at all or?\n\nDo you know anything about yours?\n\nAlright well I know this is kinda like ironic I guess you could say since we're talking about this I know two gay guys both of them were involved in church and both have played Jesus in the stations of the cross\n\nUm I believe the youth minister probably does and you know he's a cool guy he's chill and all ya know he's modern ya know I said ya know like five billion times right there\n\nUm he our youth minister ya gee I keep sayin it\n\nOh man, it's a habit he is very he's like 24ish um so he's very in with the modern ways I guess you could say but on the other hand ya know he still has faith in his religion and everything so I think the new generation has just as much faith just their more lenient on different things so we were saying how the um church could change their views in the future I do think it's possible like you said but then on the other hand agreeing with number eighteen because I forgot your name um that it will take a long, long time for it to get there\n\nIn Alabama?\n\nChristians in general Not even just Christians\n\nBut um let's see if it was legalized ya know arrgh there it goes again but um you were saying how ya know you have friends oh my God almighty alright so you have uh you have you can basically ya know Oh my God!\n\nIt's like saying like when you're a 13 year old girl.\n\nWestside Story Sharks\n\n\n",

        "Well, talking from personal experience um my Dad's an engineer and you know when I was growing up he always used to joke around you know don't be an engineer there's like no women in the field and stuff like that, and it's it's you know really true when I do talk to him there's never any women in like high level positions in the engineering field and I think there's still a lot of fields like that where women aren't um equally represented as men are given uh positions that are as good\n\nHmm?\n\nWell, yeah, which are dominated by women and then you know you look at our government and what's the first time in U.S. history that there's a female speaker of the house and only the second female secretary of state I mean it's been such a there's such a lasting tradition of gender discrimination, I think I think it's kinda like what we were talking about last time there's just a lot of [inaudible] of racism and things like that it's really um if it ever is completely possible to do um it's gonna take a lot longer to eradicate from society\n\nYeah, that's why that's like I said it's the same thing\n\nWell that's another thing I hate it was last year I was reading an article in Newsweek about education, and about how it seems to be like a pendulum swing in the other direction in elementary education, whereas it used to be that the teachers always focused on the boys because you know the boys had to go to the schools and things like that and and how now it seems like the education is much more focused on girls because there are and you know there have been studies and stuff you know, boys and girls learn differently and that it's and then it seems like teachers are more catering to girls and like the boys were being left behind and they kind of become like the goof balls of the class and and [inaudible]\n \nYeah, I mean my Mom uh  she and my Dad are the same age and so that means they got married in like the early 20's and you know they both graduated from college and then they didn't have enough money for both of them to go to graduate school so who goes to graduate school? my Dad so now she's now she's a teacher \n\nHate them for that by the way.\n \nIt's well the whole SAT is socioeconomically unfair I mean\n \nYou know I remember I think it was I don't know a year or two ago I was reading an article where they were talking about Venus Williams, and they were talking about the disparity in um uh prize money for male and female tennis players and you know they were asking what she thinks about a solution you know because people were talking about how maybe it's not fair because you know men play the five sets and women only play three sets\n\nAnd, I thought it was interesting Venus said that well, why not just have them men play three sets \n\nI mean what did what did what was it the president of Harvard was it last year? who who you know in a public speech or something put down women and said they can't uh uh achieve uh or they can't really learn or understand math or science as well as men or that guys\n\nYou remember this?\n\nYeah like I don't remember exactly what he said, but it was something to that effect.\n\nYeah\n \nI mean the president of Harvard \n\nMmhmm.\n\nBut then again, I also think that present is there's also a stereotype against women settling down and just having kids just wanting to be a wife and mother from certain areas I mean my high \n\nI mean my high school you know God forbid you would ever say anything like that that you just want to have a family and be a mother you know and if it's so I went to an all-girls, private, high school\n\nSo you know, it's gotta be you know a hundred percent graduation rate and going to college you know?\n\nIt, it can't be anything else\n\nAnd, and, and what I'm saying too I think is I guess just in the realm of education there's kind of like a pendulum swing in the other direction trying to make up for that norm that has been in place for so long you know in terms of elementary education and\n\nYeah\n\nYeah, as long as people are aware of it because I mean it's always gonna be there\n\nJust because you have individual people with their own ideas and their own uh um biases and thoughts about the way the world should be and things like that it as long as people don't forget about it and continue\n\nJust look the history of of this country the number of women who do wait to get married, or don't marry at all or get divorced and live on their own it's increasing\n\nThat's because all people are concerned with is getting drunk.\n\n\nThat's, that's all the conversations\n\nYeah, I used to do it with my friends over midnight breakfast like [inaudible]\n\nAlthough actually I just went to I just came from uh an event uh organized by my Spanish professor uh it was called um from Baltimore to Palestine and back it was a whole presentation on the Palestinian culture and music and art and things like that, and there were two speakers there and both of them talked about the shooting\n\nUm \n\nIt was um it well it counts as a cultural event like in a lot of classes, people are required to go to that's what kills me no one you know people organize these things and no one actually shows up I mean it counts for me as a cultural event, but I would have gone anyway\n[S11] I showed up when I I think the week they were doing all the stuff about the gay gene, etcetera, etcetera I couldn't go to most of them because I was in class, but the one's I did go to the small turnout boggled my mind the same thing with the Holocaust\n\nSeriously\n\nYeah\n\nYeah, no it is.\n\nI mean\n\nNot to mention if somebody actually brings up something in class you know it's like pulling teeth to try and get people to speak\n\nNot surprised.\n\nI know and it is\n\nYeah\n \nThat's who I talk about these issues with is my professors\n\nHistory and Spanish\n\nDouble major\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Yes \n\nOhh, we got some hesitation.\n\nI mean ever discrimination is pretty bad.\n\n\nLike there’s always gonna be that thought in the back of everyone’s head that women aren’t equal because they weren’t equal for such a long time they still aren’t really but they were seen as really being below men and that’s still gonna be residing in the back of everyone’s mind\n\nI think it’s funny.\n\nThere is, I’m not gonna lie.\n\nWell in the same light like it is like scientifically men do have better brains when it comes to like math and sciences.\n\nWell that’s what that’s what studied have said and like women have better brains when it comes to like writing\n\nAnd like women have better are better when it comes to like language and writing and stuff like that.\n\nNo, where I work there’s a guy day secretary too.\n\n\nNo \n\nIt’s weird how when men take on feminine jobs they get made of but when women take on masculine jobs it’s fine.\n\nThat’s kind of I think war is on a different level\n\nBut you have to be physically capable to be in the war \n\nAnd a lot of like you’re not gonna get a lot of little Barbie doll girls that are gonna join the army and be really good \n\nLike doctor, lawyers and like\n\n\nYeah I was gonna say that the male nurse\n\n\nLike stay at home Dads\n\n\nI think it’s more the female in male role minus your ROTC example is more accepting than the male in the female role\n\nIf a guy is a gymnast you’re just like ok\n\nLike a ballerina\n\nYou’re like oh\n\nSo awkward\t\n\nI think I would look down on a guy who lost to a girl in a wrestling match, and I’m a girl. Like\n\nYeah I guess why not?\n\nI think it’s weird that they allowed it. It’s like girls playing football.\n\nOne year, girls joined our football team but like our football coach was a huge jerk so like there was no way they would ever get playing time like and it’s weird cause they can’t go in the locker rooms during half time cause ya know\nIt should have been R \n\nIt couldn’t have been G. It musta been PG.\n\nBut, yeah. Two totally different things even though it’s just ya know the human body, but different genders I don’t know\n\nEven in history though women have been painted naked.\n\nActually I take that back statues\n\nYeah definitely. I think that’s true.\nI don’t know how like gender discrimination works \n\nIt’s ok for a woman to be portrayed as sexual objects, but if a man is then \n\nIt wouldn’t be as normal. Like you’re used to seeing a woman portrayed and selling sex and stuff like that\n\nYeah\n\nOh yeah\n\nI do remember that.\n\nIt was weird.\n\nI don’t think either should be.\n\nTo make it fair, they both should be\n\nI think in that sense, men are but if it’s like a CEO position at a top country company and a woman and a man are qualified for the same position like who do you think is going to get the job?\n\nWho’s the other one?\n\nOr who?\n\nWhat?\n\nI don’t know who that is.\n\nI don’t watch the news.\n\nThat’s tricky.\n\nMe too\n\nYeah and he’ll have like the whole black community behind him.\n\nOh really?\n\nOh ok then Hilary’s a shoe-in\n\nLike women in top positions like even in the Office Jen do you watch the office?\n\nWhat? She’s Michael’s boss\n\nLike she gets not respect\n\nYeah but like they like they treat her as she’s\n\nLike they don’t \n\nThey made out in a hotel once.\n\nLike now into the third season they’ve established a relationship but even now like none of like the people under her take her seriously they don’t take their relationship seriously\n\nThat’s a good show. You should probably watch it. But even like the way women are portrayed in that show like one character\n\nYou have the secretary\n\nYeah who her story line is based around Jim\n\nJim’s girlfriend\nYou have the alcoholic and then you have the like homely looking one.\n\nYeah\n\nAnd she’s larger\n\nUm like you have your stereotypical women and like all of their story lines are based around like relationships like Angela is in a relationship with Dwight Pam’s relationship with um Jim um \n\nThe alcoholic doesn’t really have that big of a role she just drinks sometimes and then Phyllis has a relationship with this Bob Vance from Vance Refrigeration \n\nOh I definitely think it says something. And Jen it’s her relationship with Michael I think it’s definitely negative because it’s like talking basically their roles depend on men\n\nIs an alcoholic\n\nYeah\n\nPlug watch the Office 8:30 Thursday nights \n\nYeah the stereotypes\n\nWell, Hilary’s more established.\n\nI don’t know. I honestly don’t\n\nNot anything\t\n\nUm\n\nHow’s that short?\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Better?\n\nNope.\n\nI'm Jewish.\n\nYeah, I think it's I just think it's like like you don't you talk about the Methodist church or the Episcopalian Church\n\nIt's something that's like been given power through like centuries yeah\n\nWell, see that's the thing the Pope isn't supposed to be human\n\nThe Pope is supposed to be an extension of Christ, right?\n\nWell, this particular Pope wasn't.\n\nAll German born boys and girls were in different\n \nYeah, but they're not Catholic.\n\nEpiscopalian\n\nI don't think so. I don't think they have anything to do with\n\nI don't know, what do you think of that?\n\nYeah, yeah I just\n\nHmm, that's interesting.\n\nDoesn't every religion has that that's old\n\nUm, just as an aside real quick I just uh texted my Episcopalian, theology major friend it's not a branch of Catholicism\n\nIt's Ok, it's Ok no, it's alright I just wanted to clear that cause \n\nNo, no that's fine. That's fine. I just had to make sure for myself.\n\nTrue.\n\nIt is one of the only denominations of any religion where women can't be the head religious \nRight, all the rules you're gonna look at  for every religions I don't mean to always bring it back to like every religion, but Catholicism isn't really so far off from like different sects Orthodox Judaism or\n\nOr you know different um you know strictly following Muslims and so forth in that the rules were written in a time and age where everything was different and they're not gonna change you know the written aspects of it you can't people don't have the power you can't rewrite the Bible you can't put amendments to the testament\n\nRight, yeah I know, I know\n\nOh absolutely but that's what I'm saying, if they're not gonna put amendments, you shouldn't interpret it differently, but when you're talking about the rules that they still follow well, yes, the Catholic Church probably needs to change their change their rules to certain things, but like on the same hand like I mean you also just have to like use your proper discretion proper time and place discretion on things\n\nLike Loyola not giving like Loyola doesn't have at the Health Center like you know condoms or day after pills and things like that even though we have a school that like you guys said drugs apparently you know so\n\nSure right I mean you know what I'm saying? so it's \n\nYou have people that strictly follow it yeah, sure\n\nIs is there a problem with your grandmother following her the religion that has probably done a lot for her in her life\n\nBut that's what makes religion different than like your own opinion on things is that you have\n\nThere's the whole aspect of like you're not the only thing making decisions, you're not the only reason that there is you know\n\nYou have a philosophy, it sounds like\n\nOk, sure.\n\nMmhmm\n\nBut they're also, I mean three of them are for your treatment of uh three of the Ten Commandments are for your treatment of God and the other seven are how to treat your fellow man, and I think of the ten probably two or three four or five of them aren't applicable to common to now\nLike which I don't know um what I'm gonna think off the top of my head I don't know um what the Ten Commandments are but um not everybody for example uses God's name in vain all the time\n\nThat's breaking the law.\n\nSure\n\nIsn't it covet your neighbor's possessions, isn't that what it was?\n\nThere's also keep the Sabbath holy which\n\nThey're all kind of one in the same. More or less\n\nThat's more of  Jewish way of looking at God though, that it's completely all around you and you don't have to be within something because God is like um an all encompassing aspect of your life that you don't have to go into a spot to see or talk to\n\nIsn't the like Muslim faith don't they have other ways of going to\n\nBut, they also believe in preach these um I don't know what it is what the word is, but you die for in the name of\n\nAllah? Maybe to be a martyr yeah\n.\nI mean I'm not talking about that, but anyhow they go to heave where they're if you do this, you go up to this magical place where it's you and like seventeen virgins something like that that's why all\n\nThat's why all these people strap bombs and\n\nIt's just supposed to give you guide headlines to which you interpret with what it means to yourself.\n\nYeah, but there's no according\n\nBut, I think the point that to us they're trying to make is you don't live your life according to the religion\n\nYou live it around not around, but\n\nYou're not supposed to do anything. You don't have to you chose not to\n\nRight, you didn't have to\n\nI bet they would.\n[S10 Why, cause\n\nSee\n\nBut, even still really just dictating different laws that aren't set in stone or \n\nI think everyone agrees with that.\n\n\n\n",
        "I mean who's but who's to say that you know the society of the 21st century is so great or \n\nYeah, better or I mean that that the Catholic church should conform to it, and I mean maybe it's a good thing that on certain issues it clashes\n\nSo, agnostic?\n\nWait, what?\n\nWell, he's human, but he's infallible.\n\nYeah, he's not I'm sorry\n\nHe's not without error I think like in terms of his actions or anything like that, but in terms of doctrine\n\nBut why, but why is it that you think that it should change? being not a part of it\n\nThat is something that I feel we should change as well.\n\nIn uh  to point out that there are some married Priests in the Catholic Church\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church \n\nExactly I'm just\n\nHere's my question what does that have to do with 21st century and why the church needs\n\nIt's, but it's not \n\nBut, it's not the Priest who is forgiving you it's God forgiving you \n\nIsn't that a personal choice, that doesn't really effect\n \nIt's Ok.\n\nBut, there are Roman Catholic even married Priests\n\nI know, I know, I'm just Priest thing it wasn't a \n\nSorry that [inaudible]\n\nNo, I don't.\n\nUm, yeah I mean I don't think you need to agree with everything that the uh  Catholic Church uh proposes or uh the stance on issues I don't think you have to support everything that it says in order to be um part of the church uh and I do think there are things that should be changed like I do think that women should be allowed to enter the clergy and I think that Priests should be allowed to marry um I mean\n \nYeah and I like what you're saying I think there are certain traditions that have become so much a part of the Catholic Church that I think it's hard to change them but I think they should be changed like I think the whole Priests not marrying \n\nWell, yeah then yes rules like with the whole priest not being able to marry thing the whole reason that priests were banned from marrying in the first place is back in uh the what century were we in? \n\nYeah, something like that yeah because it was common practice for priests to marry, but then once they start once the Catholic Church starts becoming powerful and once priests are owning land and the kids um get the land and not the church you know that's a problem for the church because they want the land so all this so you know one of the main factors in priests not being able to marry is power\n\nI mean there there is rational and there are people who spoke about who wrote about how priests shouldn't be allowed to marry because they should be completely devoted to God and the church and he can't divide that sense of responsibility between the family and the church, but I think I don't know if you agree with me that one of the main reasons was money and power money and land\n\nUm, and you know so it's something and then it's something that became part of the rules and just has become tradition then\n\nWell, yeah, and \n\nYeah, yeah I think that people\n \nI mean I think people tend to dismiss the Catholic Church and maybe all organized religion too easily because particular things that they see need to be changed, but then I think there are lots of things that go against the life in the 21st Century that are important stands against it \n\nThat's another one.\n\nWell, there is you know thou shall not um  commit adultery and thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife, and and there's\n\nAnd there's though shall not steal, and it's thou shall not covet thy neighbor's possessions.\n\nWell, yeah one's like the action and then the thought I guess\n\nThe thing is with the Catholic Church the Catholics find rest in God\n\nAre you\n\nSee, I always at least I was always taught that you can\n\nBut, if you put your hands right you get a blessing\n\nOh, that if you're not Catholic when people are going up to receive communion, you don't receive and to show that you're not Catholic you don't receive you put your hands over like this and um and then they the priests will give you a blessing\n\nWell, that's that's something\n\nThat's something new to me because I've always been taught something different so\n\nAnd as a Eucharistic Minister, I was also taught that I am not allowed to refuse communion to anyone. Whoever goes up whoever goes up to obtain\n\nRight, well, I'm just saying this is what I've been taught in a Catholic Church.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut, here's a question why does that why does that exactly if people you know want that in their life and they want that kind of life why should you \n\nPeople don't\n\nBut a lot of people the majority of them don't \n\nOnly if you're nineteen or older.\n\nI'm eighteen.\n \nFor us, it's just don't eat meat.\n\nSee, going back to the original question I don't think that the Catholic Church should conform to anything I think that it should if necessary change to according to what's right is or \n\nYeah, well what they feel is right, not necessarily what 21st Century society perceives as right like I mean I think there was a bunch of it in the Catholic Church goes against 21st Century society because according to what it believes are right like you know they're against the death penalty, and abortion and [inaudible] which I think is necessary there are necessary stands that \n\nNo, no I no I completely understand where you're coming from I just don't think that organized religion needs should necessarily should you know conform\nNo, I I agree with that\n\nBut, I think but I think that I think you can't attack like every\n\nWow\n\n",
        " Yeah I don't think I'm not sure if we can pull out right now because I mean if we leave then the situation there is just gonna get horrible probably but at the same time I don't know what we can accomplish from staying because I feel like we don't have sort of a set plan we're just kind of like there and I don't know if there's a lot of things that they don't tell like the media and everything  but uh I, I never hear anything like real, solid goals just kinda we're there and we keep sending troops and we're gonna be there for however long it takes\n\n Also, I mean we don't know what kind of intelligence or you know information the government had I mean it could have seemed like it was solid and sure that that Saddam Hussein had WMD's but I mean we can't be sure we don't know\n\n I'm not so sure the fact that we didn't find any indicates for sure that he didn't have them at the time cause I mean I could imagine he could have however many thousands of weapons depots I mean in the second that he got sign of an invasion he could have just ordered anyone to just take it and move it out\n\n Yeah\n\n I just don't know how sure they uh or how feasible our objectives are for establishing a democracy there cause I mean it's a democracy in the middle of the Middle East how's it gonna work?\n\n Someone in my chat group said that um the U.S. what they're doing in Iraq could be compared to like or could be called modern day like colonialism\n\n Like what do you guys think about that?\n\n I mean I could definitely see us like taking on that imperialist role like just forcing our views on a people that's not ready for it, clearly\n\n I think over two years.\n\n Yeah, I think the President at this point just needs to stop being so stubborn and just open his ears to the country and just listen cause he's getting so much criticism now I mean\n\n That's why the whole like idea of a just war and all the theories behind that and the people who's jobs are just dedicated to that study that's why like that typically is so important to the military just so that they know I mean if they're putting their life on the line they want to be fighting for something meaningful and just I guess\n\n We were talking about in one of my classes um five different points of um what makes a war just and he showed how the war in Iraq hardly meets like any of them I think cause it's all about like feasibility of your objectives and like proportion I mean like we we sent in like highly modern technology and it's against these guys who just have AK's and everything I mean \n\n Yeah\n\n I think the most important thing that I want to see is just clear objectives I mean it's either we're doing this or we have to get out. We just have to accept the fact that nothing is happening I mean no progress is being made.\n\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n Yeah, it's the same with the whole WMD thing. \n\n Yeah, it seems like that's uh something that we could just turn towards any like ya know he has oil, we're going there\n\n Oh yeah, what do you guys think about that? The whole oil situation.\n\n Do you think like maybe Bush is just stalling the entire war? I mean cause right now it's not safe enough to actually take that oil out of like the country. So do you think what do you guys think?\n\n It's kind of scary. I mean it reminds us of like World War II times when they had to ration.\n\n And they say once um once oil become so rare that I mean it's just gonna evolve into wars just over oil like world wars\n\n Like Hydrogen you can just get that by splitting water get H-two and then oxygen gas\n\n Um coming back to Iraq um I hear last night on TV that we have like 160,000 people over there extra that are not actually military, but like privateers that are like mercenaries so we actually have about like over 250,000 troops there when everybody only thinks that we have like like I think its like 145,000 like military what do you guys think about that? I mean I mean that's I think that's the most\n\n I mean in Vietnam I'm not sure if we hired mercenaries to\n\n Yeah\n\n I'm not sure, but I think there's more actually hired people over there than actually U.S. military actually no no, there's less [laughter] a little bit less\n\n No?\n\n Well that's true yeah\n\n Hmm.\n\n Well, North Korea is a definite threat  I mean Iraq\n\n I mean Iraq like I don't think it was as clear cause of the whole was there WMD's or not? but I mean North Korea they have a massive army I've heard that like eventually it'll surpass ours I'm not sure if it's like getting to that point already\n\n Admit defeat\n\n So what do you think his motivation is?\n\n But, how feasible is that though for a man to actually say that just for his reputation to keep all these troops over there and plus, I mean won't his reputation go up if he pulls them up?  I mean the entire country I mean even in the situation we have at worst, the entire country wants them out\n\n Well, no not yeah most I mean \n\n If it was such a simple decision then why hasn't he\n\n Yeah, I feel like he must know something we don't.\n\n Well, I mean he knows a lot of things that we don't.\n\n But uh you know what I mean because like you said he doesn't have to worry about re-election, so I feel like since he doesn't have to worry about that he can actually do like you said what\n\n I agree we need to come up with something \n\n We need to either come to a solution or just accept the fact that there is none and accept that lesser of two evils, and pull out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Yes\n\nWhat I don't understand though is like how we initially really even just diverged to Iraq after September 11th we sent our troops to Afghanistan like a couple weeks later\n\nThe next thing I know I'm hearing that there's a war in Iraq and I'm just wondering what's going on in Iraq now\n\nI thought Osama Bin Laden was the guy we were looking for and now they have weapons of mass destruction which we find out they don't actually have and I I don't know it all went down hill we just destabilized their government we took Saddam out of power but we didn't really accomplish anything we just left them in a greater state of chaos than we went in there to\n\nUh-huh\n\nYea I think that's a good example I think the government definitely did take advantage of 9-11 the whole like catastrophe and everything\n\nAnd they kind of used that to push their own motives in a way as wrong as it sounds I think that's probably what might have happened because \n\nYea they sent them over to Afghanistan to find Osama Bin Laden then all of a sudden they're in Iraq they capture Saddam Hussein in a matter of months and Osama Bin Laden is still nowhere to be found and I just find that really weird because I don't know Saddam has like these people who are made to look like him and everything like that but somehow they found the right guy whereas Osama like I think he's probably one of a kind\n\nExcept for nowadays when now he's becoming probably a bigger threat Al Qaeda's like growing and becoming a bigger threat now that we're over across seas and we're kind of we got all this focus on Iraq we're still trying to stabilize that so they're I don't know for all we know they could be planning something\n\nTo take advantage because we're all over there\n\nThat makes three of us\n\nUh-huh\n\nUh-huh yea I think that um what was I gonna say um yea I think that um we can't really pull the troops out until we finish what we started I mean we went in there we did probably as much damage as Saddam Hussein did in his in his time in power and now if we were to just leave them in this state they would it would just be complete anarchy I mean you'd see everybody would be worse off without us over there at this point because of the government over there isn't stable at all like the the whole like system of government that they decided to choose they decided that they're gonna throw a democracy into Iraq if you throw a democracy into Iraq these people are used to totalitarian dictatorship they're going to really know what to do with this I mean you're giving them something completely different than what they're used to \n\nIt's like it's like bringing someone I don't know bringing someone from back in time to the modern country or something and just showing them something that they've never seen before and they're not used to that at all so it's gonna just cause more problems than actually solve like sure they could want freedom but this isn't the way to go about giving it to them \n\nYea I think it only had like three parts go in set up democracy leave\n\nBut they forgot about all the stuff \n\nOh yea I definitely think it's a much different culture I mean like especially since Muslims like the Muslim religion and all of that like I mean people see like Iraq and all of that as like the government forcing the forcing like the strong practices of religion which it was an everything but now that's so ingrained in the people's minds that trying to change that those ideas it's just gonna be a lot more hectic because you'll have all on one side the people who don't want to change and then you have the other side is the people who do want to change and when they clash it's just civil war I mean we've already seen civil war start and just break out between the Sunnis and the Shiites so I don't think you can really clash our cultures and expect a good result from that\n\nI'm trying to think of something else to say.\n\nI probably have something somewhere but it's not floating to my mind right now\n\nI think yea I think in order to get democracy first you have to make them want it I mean if you look at the establishment of America like the colonies back in the colonial ages like you had the Monarch and everybody was satisfied with the Monarch they had the Monarch here the parliament and all of that and the people over in Britain if their thoughts of um democracy was pretty much anarchy they were afraid of it they didn't want it they didn't want to think anything of it but then once they got over into the colonies and they wanted to declare independence from Britain because of like the I don't know just the force that Britain had over them they kind of changed their opinions on it and they wanted it rather than opposed it I just think if we want to do that if we want to setup a government in Iraq first we have to find something that's going to work for them and work for us\n\nYea I definitely think that something definitely could have been done in the beginning like they could have had some way to go about doing this and fixing everything fixing some of the problems over there but I think their approach to it was completely wrong and they've just ended up screwing things up worse than they've actually fixed so \n\nYea \n\nPublic \n\nApproval rating yea\n\nYea\n\nNo definitely not I don't see that happening\n\nYea\n\nAnd a lot of those countries don't really like each other \n\nIn all honesty I could see that though I could definitely see um this just be like the complete obliteration of Iraq and this be like their last stand before the fall\n\nAnd somehow they're gonna fall to the powers around them and they're going to expand their territories maybe\n\nI mean with all the damage that has been done so far they're basically living in ruin I mean \n\nIt's completely destroyed \n\nWhat? Us um being destroyed?\n\nI could definitely see um some kind of other power overpowering America I mean history only shows that I mean with the Roman Empire you've had the Roman Empire you've had the British Empire all these different\n\nYea like all of these different empires just rise and fall and \n\nIt's I mean you can't say that America's gonna be the top power forever I mean someday someone's gonna rise up and takeover and for all we know it could be Russia or\n\nChina yea or even Japan\n\nYea \n\nHis wife \n\nYea\n\nYea I definitely think that one of the one of the government's main tactics especially for this war had been the using fear to kind of either gain support or like just keep the people quiet keep them in subordination so they can go out and do what they want because I mean if with the Patriot Act if you think about it how suspicious that kind of is like ok so now if they're if you say something against the war at like out at a public speech they could accuse you of being a terrorist or something like that and it's just putting all this fear into the people who want to stand up and say something to come out and say it and then you have on the other hand like these like they they had those whole terror warnings like they had the little meters like the green, orange, red, and yellow and stuff and just like having something like that just so people can say like here's your daily weather report on the chances of a terror attack and people just think oh ok today there's a high chance I support the war I mean I support the war on terror we're gonna fight them and fix this\n\n",
        "I agree  it's kind of a  cause I'm not catholic but I grew up going to church and so it's against my religion, but on the other side I have a lot of gay friends and like it's seemingly unfair because it's like hindering their lifestyle also so.\n\nNo  but then I think they would still not be happy with that.\n\nYeah  and like I feel that if it was called a union instead of a marriage and it was like distinctly  like there was a distinction between the two  like they would feel like they aren't getting the better treatment still because they aren't\n\nWith the separation of the church and the state  I think that  because  like  like  if a gay person is gonna get married they're probably not gonna get married in the church because there aren't many churches that would marry like a gay couple anyways  so I think that in that way the separation between a marriage and a union would work because the union could be associated with  uh   like getting married in  um  like a court or something like that  whereas a marriage would be in a church.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhat I mean?\n\nWell  a union would refer to like being joined as a couple in like a courthouse whereas as marriage would refer to being joined as a couple in a church.\n\nYeah. You would be like the same thing  just a different name so yes\n\nBecause the whole  I don't know\n\nIt doesn't accept gay marriage.\n\nI'm not a catholic  well I'm Protestant  four square  and my church is like adamantly\n\nWell like  they don't dislike gay people but like they're against gay marriage  oh yeah  die-hard like Republican at my church\n\nYeah, I grew up in the south  I grew up Baptist and like I feel like  exactly  it would a lot different like\n\nWell\n\nIt's not as liberal  like  I'm from  like I lived in Alabama till I was twelve and then from then till I came to here I lived in New Hampshire  and New Hampshire is a lot more liberal than it was in the south \n\nYeah exactly  like  all the kids I went to high school with were like hippy\n\nExactly exactly and when in like the south  like completely different  I don't think even most of the people I grew up with in the south even like drank that much in high school so  and like my sister who she grew up more in the south cause she's almost four years older than me as opposed to me cause I spent most of my older years in the north  like  just her perception on like drinking and drugs and stuff like that  completely different than mine  just cause like all my friends were like oh whatever it's fine. But her friends were like adamantly against it when she was growing up so \n\nDown the coast\n\nSo like where some people are gonna be open-minded you're gonna have your conservatives completely against it  so\n\nI don't think it should be a federal issue. I think it should be up to the individual states cause not every state is Republican and not every state is Democrat so\n\nThat's true. I feel like though if it was made a constitutional law that there was no gay marriage  I feel like that would cause more controversy and more like disruption.\n\nThan individual states deciding whether or not they're gonna legalize it. Then you're gonna have bombs in the streets.\n\nI feel like that's gonna cause more rise  that'll cause rise in the streets  if Bush is like no gay marriage for anyone\n\nHe makes bad decisions. We all do.\n\nUm  they obviously feel that gay marriage should be legalized.\n\n I don't have a lot  I have a couple\n\nNo.\n\nDoes the church know they're gay?\n\nYeah  it's funny cause like  the people in my youth group  like people my age\n\nNo. New Hampshire  are like against abortion  against anything like that  ya know  so\n\nYeah  well it's not even just the catholic church it's like the\n\nYeah  but then like I'm friends with them  and I don't  I'm not like  I don't feel\n\nIt's ok. You can keep saying it.\n\nLike that have gay friends, but they wouldn't support gay marriage  ya know  so\n\nLike they aren't gonna go like burning crosses and like setting fire to people's houses but \n",
        "um I don't really know what to say I I guess the whole point that I was taught about the Catholic Church was that because it is old and ancient and has remained the same it's one of those things that's like constant kinda like the rising and setting of the sun and that it has actually gone through a lot of changes through out of the years like with the corrupt bishops and popes and everything and like new laws will be put into effect um like cause I do know that they could marry priest's could marry and have families and then when the corruption happened they made the rule that they couldn't anymore and I think nowadays there are some things that can change like um I think we've gotten past the part of corruption and I think priests should probably be allowed to marry um and I think that they should maybe I guess I think they should have the ability to change some laws like become more modern like they should allow women to become priests rather than just always nuns but other than like changes in that sense I like how some things can stay constant like yea you say the bible is outdated but in a way it's not because you can also apply it to nowadays life than just have the modern view of it I don't know a lot of sermons or masses I've been to have taken like the old readings and then taken like life examples now and they find a median in a way it's modern in that sense but it also has other changes it's structures that kinda could be changed I don't know if that makes any sense at all but\n\nYea \n\nI feel like it's a good foundation to work off of but I don't think it should be changed  \n\nAnd is that true though I mean the way I read this article um just like a week ago my roommate was reading it to me it was in like the Baltimore Sun and it was about how like politicians who supported gay marriage or who were pro-choice like the new pope was trying to write some sort of thing that was going to forbid them from receiving communion and like that's one thing that I like with the Catholic Church that I feel like they're kinda like you have to accept everything that we say which there's like a whole lot of rules or like ya know like you're not a true Catholic I don't know like what those laws are\n\nno I mean I guess it's like the infallibility of the pope that like if he like puts out some I don't know what they're called [inaudible] I don't know something he writes some sort of message and I mean the church is still very political our pope now is very ultra conservative and so that's moving the Catholic Church like as the whole he's then because of his beliefs he's moving it more to be more conservative and like after such like a long reign of Pope John Paul who was like trying to like get things to be a little more\n\nYea and we're not gonna use the word like liberal because I think liberal and Catholic are kinda\n\nbut um so yea I don't know\n\nthey're not really coming in between you and G-d they're just like there if you want them and no one's forcing you to take communion no one's forcing you to like believe everything that they say I definitely don't believe everything that they say and I'm like still a Catholic I still consider myself a Catholic but probably more of like the modern type of Catholic if that's what you're getting at um and like I guess like in other words the reason why the main reason why we have a pope from my understanding it's just to like make sure that all the churches across the nations are teaching the same passages that same Sunday is that correct? And then like they're not gonna tell like every individual priest this is how you say you say the sermon this is what you have to say and like this is how you're gonna relate it to life they're like this is what we're teaching go at it I mean\n\nright \n\nIt's also been around for years though so like that also has a huge part of it \n\nif something's been around for so long it's gonna influence something\n\nI'm not gonna agree with you\n\nDefinitely not agreeing with you um ok so like we were saying in Africa and everything I'm they're not killing other people being like oh you're not Catholic we're not gonna kill you or oh you're not Catholics or we should convert you because you're not basically if you want to listen to the message and then believe in it that's fine and if you don't that's fine and like it's not it's not like they're saying like oh well you're Jewish and you want to come teach Judaism to these people we're not gonna let you they don't do that they let \n\num no \n\nand what you were saying about like the Catholic Church and that like if you don't like follow everything I would say like that's something that I'm like kind of confused about because um I mean this is my fifteenth year of catholic school like being in Loyola and I do not agree with everything that the Catholic Church says but I I don't I mean even after fifteen years of being taught like the laws or whatever you want to say it like the Catholic Church I still don't know does that am I not Catholic then because I don't agree with everything? I feel like in some ways that you're supposed to believe everything but that to me kinda seems ridiculous too\n\nNo that's not true\n\nUm that's like all the churches I've been to they um the priest has always said that you can take what you want from the sermon and apply it to your life in how you see fit and he like they leave open doors for you to interpret how you want which that's your thinking it's not someone saying like this is how you should think so the message that they're telling people is there and like it's basically going to be the same message across everywhere it's up to the individual to take the message how they want and interpret the message how they want no one is going into your thoughts and being like do it this way\n\nSo they're really like they're controlling your mind it's kinda like when you go to class\n\nwell I mean like I understand that cause like a lot of people that I know see it that way\n\nno I can understand what you're saying cause if you want like if if you just believe a certain thing because the church tells you to\n\n And you say like oh well the Catholic Church says that ya know I don't know what contraceptives are like not\n\nYea so but if you just take everything and don't think for yourself then \n\nYea like if you choose to I don't know\n\nright I think that's what I was just trying to trying to say \n\nNo you can't say that\n\nYea I am southern and that is so no one is Catholic in the sorry I'm from the sorry no one is Catholic I'm like the minority I did not know I think I went to school with maybe five people that were Catholic there were more Jews in the south than there were Catholics so I mean everyone is Baptist and like there's so many form of Baptism I mean Baptists I cant even keep track of it and like when I go to my friends churches it's I like it cause it's a different way of teaching the same message and I mean like it's really funny cause whenever I go to someone's church I never expect it to be Catholic and then like the past weekend I went with my friend to church and it was Catholic and I was like this is really weird ok so I mean you can't say Catholicism is the cause for the conservative thought of the south because no one's Catholic \n\nwell I mean then again that's also other people's opinions like I know you're not religious and that's fine I know tons of people that aren't and I mean like I think a lot I think the tides will turn like right now people who are religious are in like power so you hear about it maybe a few years from now people who are in power aren't religious and you'll hear about that I mean it's always changing it's like whatever people it's always changing\n\nYea\n\nI totally eat\n\nYea\n\nyea no I agree with that totally cause like \n\ngo ahead.\n\nno you go first. \n\nThat's fine\nyea and I totally agree with that cause um like actually my dad has a friend who wanted to be a priest but he also wanted a family so he chose family\n\nwell also I think I don't know if Lutheranism has the same message taught across the nations I know Episcopalians do they'll have the same scriptures taught across everywhere and Catholic do but I don't think Lutherans do I could be wrong on that aspect\n\nBut I think a lot of people that is another option I mean but I don't think a lot of people know about it as much and also people like to know that the same things gonna be taught if you're in an AP class and you're gonna be taught like a certain chapter in a textbook I don't know that was like a really poor analogy\n\nBut \n\nI think that it was Jesus wasn't married so \n\nYea\n \n[inaudible] \n\nyea because it doesn't \n\nI mean again it's kind of like the whole whoever is president if they don't agree it's not gonna change right then and so you have to wait for someone else to come in and be like oh I'm hearing what the people want and I'm gonna like listen to them so \n\n",
        "You also have like a shorter history the United States being relatively young in the grand scheme of things suffrage in France [inaudible] whatever in Europe whatever didn't\n\nTrue, and that's another [inaudible] so I guess we're more progressive in the grand scheme of things than most countries, but since I'm like I think it's pretty obvious there's just certain fields and professions where it's dominated by one or the other I mean for Loyola Loyola's a female dominated school\n\nYa know and I mean\n\nEither way\n\nOh, I mean I I \n\nI'm in a class right now where it's 32 people and I'm one of four guys, and I'm almost positive I'm being discriminated against in my grades cause I'm a guy\n\nChild welfare\n\nAnd my like for example the last thing we had was this like project on a child welfare agency, so I did Outward Bound um my girlfriend's mom runs it in Philadelphia and um I got 140 out of 200 on it, and it was exactly what she asked for, but she didn't consider it a worthy enough child welfare organization even though it only deals with children people in my class girls were making up camps they worked at you know and talking about how they've worked with people and getting an average of 186 was the average grade on the thing and like I just think she respects the opinion and I know I mean the professor's a little a bit out there too I mean she's kind of a feminist type\n\nNo, I agree.\n\nYou also I mean to our country's credit you have um the evolution now of the stay at home father which is which is\n\nMuch more prevalent yeah absolutely that's my family my Mom brings home almost\n\nShe's a veterinarian, which is another until when she was in in med school in vet school it was Pennsylvania it was one of the three women to graduate in her entire class you know now it's a female dominated profession you know it's interesting it's the evolution of \n\nI thought that it was culturally unfair.\n\nYeah, I found that out too.\n\nAnd I hated psychology here because and I thought it'd be interesting, but I ended up hating it because you have like seven tests and they're all multiple choice questions, and it's impossible to learn\nAre you?\n\nI mean I'm a history major, so I didn't take a multiple choice test until I got to that class.\n\nHmm\n\nThere um there may be a professional course now that is a precedent set by uh Wimbledon this year is gonna give equal prize money to this is the first time for any sport \n\nRight, Wimbledon's gonna pay the male champion and the female champion equal.\n\nNope, nothing no other sport\n\nYeah, it's the first sport \n\nAlright \n\nWhich, is true, they do play more sets.\n\nYeah \n\nNo, I completely agree with you.\n\nNo, I know what you mean. I think um for like individual um I don't know I hate to point to sports, but it's kind of like an interesting way to look at the entire situation um for like individual sports or like an individual practice per say for like a veterinarian or an M.D. whatever like everything should be equivalent or based upon how well they're doing how much work they're doing or you know your clients they have yada, yada for team type things whereas you might have like um per say like you know a company or a big business where you have like the different levels or whatever um uh you should you know that should all be the same way according to \n\nRight, the team as a whole exactly um and then it doesn't you know whoever is the leader it's a shame because you still have a generation of older, white males that run all the corporations for the most part but that's something that's gonna be in the next ten to fifteen years twenty years changing just as speaker of the house, just like\n\nBut, as soon as these people start to retire you might start to see it\n \nI mean my family always preached more just like you grow up to be happy you know?\n\nIt's also like what a large portion the middle wants\n\nYeah I mean \n\nBut, also there's like the east coast and the west coast mentality.\nI think it's similar to the east coast in terms of like um equality and progression right and then there's like \n\nRight, and I'll use a specific example of a person I know from [inaudible] Indiana, which is northern Indiana um where this girl who was she was valedictorian of her high school for a thirty eight hundred kid high school Ok? she's like a scratch couple under golfer with offers now to like multiple schools big time like Stanford for one Ok? she's not gonna go she's gonna go to taxidermist school as a hobby and be a mom\n\nThat's what she wants.\n\nAnd she's right and she's the norm for like she's not like a girl if that same girl went to your high schools she'd go to Yale or Stanford you know?\n\nReally?\n\nThat's crazy that's also the same like the same um demographic of women that you know are are um you know like against abortion you know what I'm saying, Ok? like it works\n\nBut, it's the truth though.\n\nTradition, and you know\n\nRight, and that's it's just not it's impossible it's really, really hard to break that\n\nIf some guy came along and like swept you off your feet, and you completely you know took your mind off of school for the first time in your life wouldn't that freak you out and you'd possibly think you'd want to go on a date to see \n\nReally?\n\nIsn't there like a counter to that statistic you meet like the person you're\n\nThe experiences that you judge I'm not judging that you look upon when you're in your 20's and 30's and if you're having your first relationship when you're 25, 26, 30 years old you're very reliable to make a mistake that you possibly could have made when you were 19 and it didn't matter \n\nSo you lied.\n\nOk, I got ya\n\nOh no, that's fine.\n\nWell that's I'm sorry\n\nWell, that's something else.\n\nLike all the topics we're talking about.\n\nThat's why I hate I'm gonna throw this out there I think that Loyola's like the least enlightened college campus I've ever been to\n\nAnd it destroys me because we have there is very few like open forums for academic endeavors like open your eyes\n\nI know, people don't give a shit.\n\nI don't know. Like I go to the University of Virginia or something\n\nAlright, well I'm a \n\nNo, I know, I know I mean like half my school goes to Penn State and like I almost went to Penn State and\n\nRight, but within Penn State you have ten thousand kids that do care and that's twice as many three times as many people that go to Loyola that do care you know what I'm saying?\n\nFelt good didn't it?\n\nI think that's interesting\n\nNo, I mean the thing is I'll have to call my friends at home my friends from home that go to um you know Lehigh um or like um you know Ithaca or just different schools whatever um Villa Nova and so forth that um like that are actually more aware of the [inaudible] and I think that starts with our Professors here I'm not gonna lie I have had now seven or six classes since the shootings began yesterday morning and it hasn't\n\nNobody talks about it in class, yeah\n\nI know I think I mean\n\nNobody\n\nYeah\n\nThat's Loyola like 55% of the kids here are just gonna work for their parents\n\nOh yeah oh yeah well that's any private, expensive college sure, sure, sure\n\nWell yeah they don't care, but that's like that's different they didn't have to get good SAT scores and have good GPA's to go there\nYeah, yeah this might just be a generational thing too though maybe \n\nWith whatever it just sucks\n\nI think it could also be my friends here. Idiots.\n\nPlus I'm not in classes with all my friends and you know they don't care in my classes either\n\nTo talk right? I've never that's exactly what I yeah I know\n\nSlow down. What?\n\nOh, injury awareness day\n\nI thought you said self-interest.\n\nS10] If they needed the research credit, people would do it.\n\nYeah, it could be a Thursday.\n\nI know, and to go back to the point I don't think that it's gender specific here I think as an overall like our campus is just [inaudible]\n\nBut, I mean it's at the same time like like we don't go to you know Harvard or Princeton, and like where there's like student activists people, groups, organizations still prevalent I mean can you name a student group here\n\nWhy did Why did you guys choose Loyola?\n\nMe too.\n \nWhich is a good quality of Loyola small\n \nOh yeah absolutely\n\nWhat is everyone's major here?\n\nSo psych major with a photo minor\n\nDouble major?\n\nDouble? I'm a history major myself but I  I think my question would be um you're kind of in the same boat as me the history department is strong you have um like a lot of professors that you can get in touch with easily you know have dinner with if you need to meet them and understand them um this college is probably not \n\nMy question for you though is I mean I didn't I didn't know Loyola specifically strongly within those categories within bio and chem., but um I'll give you the name, maybe you know him my roommate Ryan Cunningham you know who he is?\n\nHe's a biochem double major also you probably have classes with him um probably I don't know anyhow I mean do you find that like it's academically enriching and what you wanted it to be for that major? because I think most of the people here already come to school already with a plan which is different from most schools I think you go to college to find yourself a lot of people here go here to be in Sellinger\n\nYeah, yeah, exactly\n\nRight\n\nBut it doesn't take you any further, is that what you're saying?\n\n",

And  and  the school has  has this policy where like  if you go into the student life office you're not allowed to look on Facebook because if they see pictures of drinking they are obligated to, once they see it, they're obligated to do something about it\n\n So  the  the middle ground that we've found is that they aren't going to go out of their way  looking for something\n\n But  if it is  brought up for a reason which is under the realm of that umbrella of violence or threats or anything like that  and if they investigate that rightfully  then they can take you down for everything they see  like if they see a picture of you drinking a beer and you're a freshman and you're 18  then they'll take you down for that  as well as what they were originally looking for\n\n No  no  it is  it happens  it happens  I mean  if you have a solo cup there's only so much they can do  if you have a solo cup and there's beer in the background and you're not 21  then you were in the presence  and you were at a social gathering\n\n So they can get you for that charge  if you have a beer in your hand but you're not drinking it  they can't actually get you for drinking but they can get you for possession  and if there's an actual picture of you  actually drinking  then it can be possession, underage, all that, and if there's a picture of you with a beer bong then they can get you for all of the above and excessive  and if it's clearly in your room then they can get you for all the above and social host\n\n Yea  yea  so you know about this stuff\n]\n You know about this stuff  but  I mean  just tell your residents  don't be stupid  just  don't put stupid pictures up\n\n The end of the hall  do those cameras rotate?\n\n They do? Alright\n\n Because  they checked  do they check the camera for an incidence which was related to that room?\n\n They checked the camera for an incidence which wasn't related to that room  or any of the residents who lived in that room\n\n Well  once they see it  once they see it\n\n Once they see it  they have to do something about it\n\n Yea  and the other thing is the law under the law doesn't exactly  I mean  for the most part  doesn't really extend onto this campus because of the fact that it is a private institution because of the fact that we legally agreed to abide by the code of conduct as specified in the handbook  so when you get in trouble you get a letter talking about which parts of the handbook you violated  so  they really have their own law code on campus  and their own judicial system  and  none of the legal stuff really applies  unless  well  whatever  yea\n\n Yea  someone who's good with  making them self seem like a horny, gay, 13 year old  on  online  like  that's good \n\n What do you do for a living? Oh  I bate pedophiles online   Yea \n\n Yea  but I mean  like  like  there's  there's also lots of upsides to things like  Facebook and Myspace  as social tools  as  things  as mechanisms for making freshmen feel more comfortable and more at home  when  whatever's going on  um  ya know  new surroundings and whatnot  can research the community  join groups \n Yea  yea  kill hours at a time when you should be doing homework\n\n Yea  Facebook is  but Facebook is public although it's less  it's a little  like  Facebook  is public but you can expect a little bit more privacy just because of the way it's setup\n\n But  but  by the same token  while everything that you put on  Myspace  is  public as we've already decided  everything that you put on Facebook is owned my Mark Zuckerberg \n\n And his crew  which means  and you agreed to that when you signed up  I did too.\n\n I checked the box too  which I think is gonna be great if he decides to be an asshole about it 21 years from now when we have like Senators  and what not who are now  and they have really embarrassing pictures of themselves on Facebook and he  can do what he wants with them\n\n For the most part  I mean  I'm sure they could make it hard for him  but he can  most  mostly do what he wants\n\n Oh  yea\n\n Yea  I work as a recruiter  and I spend a lot of time on Facebook  looking at seniors Facebook profiles\n\n And  it's good if somebody has a list of all the activities they do\n\n Because then  there it is  it's a list of everything  it's right there  and  it's not a showstopper if they have a crazy picture of them like hanging upside naked chugging a bottle of vodka or whatever  but  I mean  for a lot of recruiters and for a lot of companies  like  it definitely is\n\n Yea\n\n Yea\n\n Jeez\n\n Are you a convicted felon? Yes or No  Can you make sure of that? Yes or No?\n\n From the moment you put it up  it is property of Facebook\n\n Yea\n\n Yea  he pretty much has a  are you  what year?\n\n Ok  last year  we sent out a letter  remember it?\n\n Ok  it  it  went to all the mail stops  it went to everyone's mailbox on campus  and it said  ya know  student life doesn't prowl around but ya gotta be careful because professors do and a lot of other people have Facebooks and even some administrators when they get curious  they have Facebook accounts  and they all look around and they all check  I mean  and they might  and you don't know  so you still have to be careful and watch yourself  and also  Mark Zuckerberg owns everything you put up\n\n Got an important message\n\n People  people do that  but  I mean  it's still linked to the email address\n\n It's just craziness  but Facebook does have its good sides too\n\n As a publicity tool  social\n\n Yea\n \n That's a good idea  as an administrative tool\n\n Depends if it's a public or a private school\n\n Well  there was a public school  I don't remember where it was  but I read a USA Today article about it  like  almost a year ago  yea  it was a long time ago  where  it was a private school that kicked out a kid because he was gay  it was like a very religious school  something like that  um  and they did that  and as a private school like  they had the right to do that\n\n I  I guess more or less  I don't know how the case turned out  but  as  as a private school  I think that they  had the right to do that  but  at the same time  there was an argument that it was  that it was discrimination and that that put him  like  in a  ya know  it's against like federal laws against discrimination and what not  and like  I think those laws apply  to like that school in a certain way  I don't even know all the details  but  I think they apply even more so to public universities\n\n Because  cause  if it's a public school it's getting the funding of a state government or a federal government then its actions  ya know  have to be  in accordance with  because  because then the state and federal government is accountable for what they do  so \n\n Yea\n\n The cops here don't like busting us up  like \n\n They don't want to bust us up  and the RAs here  with some exceptions  with some exceptions  who feel like they're on a moral crusade  most of the RAs here  most of the RAs here don't like writing people up either\n\n But  when the RA knocks on the door and it smells like weed  and the RA has to call a GRC to the student representative president and the cops and they have to make a big deal out of it  and when the cops get those calls  a lot of them are just like  oh  shit\n\n We gotta go bust up a bunch of kids drinking  ya know  what are they really doing bad  they're just drinking beers or whatever\n\n Yea   we have to move  we can't just sit in our cars on Notre Dame and make sure no one gets robbed\n\n Like  yea  and  and by the same token  like  cops in  in suburban towns  cops in my town love busting up parties  they love hauling in all the kids who were being roughians  and corrupting our society  but  like  if you had a bunch of 12 year olds at a kegger  on York Road  ya know  or on the Alamaeda  like somewhere in [inaudible] neighborhood  I don't think the cops would really care  cause they have much worse things to attend to  ya know?\n\n Yea  so from an enforcement standpoint  but then again  that's the question  ya know from an enforcement standpoint  how do you prioritize one law over another?\n\n Could be\n\n Yea  so  where do you  how do you prioritize? \n\n I guess  I guess what it all comes down to is like  the law is an inanimate thing  but  the people who are supposed to abide by it and the people who are supposed to  um  enforce it  are  animate and have judgment  and have to make split second decisions a lot of the time  so  it's just like  I feel like there's a lot of  if not so much gray area  there are just a lot of questions which people are  are always asking about like  well how do you reconcile it to  like  if  a bunch of cops make a bad decision and  say  highly politicized example \n\n Like Rodney King  ya know  does that mean all law enforcement officers are crap? No. But it just shows that there is a very human  dimension to law enforcement  just like there is to any other profession  like  Enron  that was just human people  fucking up  like\n\n If  if it is for terrorist reasons  ya know  and  if it is clearly a threat to national security  I think absolutely \n\n They should go ahead and do it  and even to an extent  if  if there are  ya know  administrative things in place which would prevent that from happening which in a lot of cases they are  then  like sure  ya know  the executive branch  I  I think they should have a little bit of leeway with doing that  but then there's just a really important question that comes up from that  is  or  a couple  like  who gets to make the call of who they tap? And\n\n And  should that person be accountable  or not  cause if you hold them too accountable they might not be able to be effective  but they might be over effective if they're acting without accountability  and then  also  if they hear  if  if they tap  ya know  some kid  who they think is a terrorist  and they hear him talking about money laundering  or they hear him talking about coke dealing  can they  can they prosecute him for that? When  they were going after something totally different\n\n And  and  when  although there are circumstances where it's justified  it still is sidestepping the auspices of the justice system  more or less  which could be justified in certain cases  but  like  I mean  then  are they allowed to all of a sudden pull cases back into the justice system after stepping back out of it\n\n I don't know  I'm not saying it's morally wrong  I'm just saying these are like philosophical questions  which just punches out of the bag\n\n Um  yea\n\n Privacy  and then  and then like out  outside this country it's even  it's even more complicated  like we used to have all these  all these ties  ya know  back in  like during the Cold War  we had all these ties  ya know  with like  or  even in like the 60s with Noreaga and his bankers  and all these people  and the Cold War we had like  human assets  like people who we paid  and then  they got rid of all of them after that  and then 9-11 came around and they were all scrambling  like  well where are out human assets  who can we talk to? Ya know  and that just raises the questions about  well what about  privacy of people who are outside the country who are outside our jurisdiction  but  forces which originate within our jurisdiction are deliberately acting in ways which  but  there  there's no government in  ya know  at the time  there was no government in Panama to make sure it didn't happen  or the government in Columbia in the early 90's  like  ya know  we were all collaborating or whatever  so  I don't know  can't really say if you're for or against  it think it's just so situational  it's just so hard to make a blanket statement  it's good  it's bad\n\n Cause it's so situational\n\n Yea  bad call  bad call\n\n\n",
        "Well um considering that ya know people's religions views might effect how they think about it but it's also only a portion of the population what do you guys think is the um  relationship between church and state should be in this situation\n\nBut then\n\nBut should people be allowed to use religious reasoning when they're arguing for or against gay marriage\n\nBut people just use it cause it's a marketing tool like in um in Pennsylvania like Rick Santorum made it a big big staple of his platform and he got elected for a term in the Senate just cause I mean I guess it was important to his constituency um and they thought that way but I don't know it just kind of blurs the line between the two in a way\n\nWell do you guys feel that to grant um gay couples the legal rights that come with marriage just in terms of filing for taxes and cosigning mortgages and visiting each other in the hospital and adopting kids and things like that do you think that to grant them a an institution while although not called marriage in eyes of the law is viewed equal to marriage do you think that that would infringe upon say Catholic social teaching or any of the other popular religious views\n\nWell people argue against it on on religious grounds but even if even if people don't overtly argue against it on a religious grounds I think a lot of people argue against it because they say oh well the fabric of society will come apart and then ya know people are gonna start marrying animals  and then it's just gonna break down our whole future and all that but it might all stem from a religious an essentially an originally religious argument\n\nI think most of the gay couples who do want to get married just want to do it like I was saying for more of a legal status rather than for the idea of it like so they can do things like cosign on a mortgage buy a house\n\nYea\n\nYea or at least get get the privileges that married couples do even if they don't get ya know communion or whatever\n\nBut still I mean say say hypothetically if a politician represented an area that was like a very like say Utah it's that's a very I mean I'm not trying to stereotype but there's a lot of Mormons in Utah\n\nA lot a lot of very faith based communities in Utah so you do think that then Politicians from Utah would be warranted using a religious argument even if it was in political forum? like against gay marriage\n\nOr it might not be what makes them vote but it might be what ends up turning them into\n\nA single issue voter\n\nWhere they're voting because of abortion or because of gay marriage as opposed to because of the whole picture\n\nBut um then it's how about for another question if it is gonna be going on a state by state basis and judges in state supreme courts are gonna be the ones who are gonna be like passing laws ya know allowing ya know a particular city or judges in a particular city will say ok well we can do it in this city um how do you feel about that? If they're going against the grain of what's allowed in most other places like do you think that that the judges like a judge somewhere should be allowed to decide just cause that that's a big argument that comes up against gay marriages oh well these activist judges shouldn't be allowed to be deciding this\n\nIt's gonna be a hell of a court case\n\nThat's not gonna happen\n\nHis basis for that is he believes that marriage should be between a man and woman end of story\n\nEnd of story and but but he's just putting that in as a symbol though cause he knows it's not gonna make it through\n\nHe doesn't control either house anymore like he knows it's not gonna make it through he's just putting it up there to make all the people who voted for him because of that happy\n\nBut then you get into questions about who has the right to make the decision whether it should be state by state like the Supreme Court probably wouldn't want to take it on because they they might think that it was unconstitutional for them to legislate on something like that and even if Congress took it on I'm sure someone would challenge it up to the Supreme Court saying it was unconstitutional It should be a state by state thing.  Then either way even if like one state allowed gay marriages I don't know I'm just thinking legally could turn into a big fight everyone's just kinda putting it off\n\nDo you think that um gay couples bringing up children is detrimental to the children?\n\nI'm glad we all agree on this but I guess it doesn't make for  a very interesting conversation um \n\nThat's what I'm trying to do \n\nWell the church's stance at least now what it's been whittled down to on homosexuals having sex is that it's not immoral except for in the sense that it's not for the purpose or procreation\n\nAnd so they say that procreation is the only justification for sexual activity so they say that's bad\n\nIt depends which which priest would would it depends which priest's rant you read because there are a lot or like which theologians book you read but\n\nNo that's pretty crazy G-d wars\n\nYea seriously\n\nI know a Jesuit priest who's openly gay\n\nBut he was totally celibate\n\nLike that South Park episode\n\nYea\n\nYou are very confused\n\nWell do you think homosexuality is a choice or a genetic thing?\n\nRight\n\nWell we don't talk about it but in Ancient Greece they were all about it\n\nIt it was their thing it was like did you guys see the um the movie with Brad Pitt\n\nTroy yea um his his cousin in the movie is actually like his his man-bitch in in the story it's like his lover\n\nIt was like a boy who was younger than he was and in the movie it's like oh cousin how I have missed you and my roommate called it out he was like um no \n\nI mean yea that just points to like the fact that homosexuality is just so taboo \n\nI don't know\n\nThat's just kinda strange \n\nCraziness \n\nWhat like mythology class?\n\nWell that explains it\n\nSo gay marriage \n\nOr paternal depending on what's going on\n\nThat's pretty crazy\n\nAmendment banning gay marriage\n\nDoes the federal government have the right to do that?\n\nBe because I mean I'm not I'm not asking that in like oh a let's start a revolution kinda way I'm asking that in like the way legal community is gonna look at it whoa hold on can they really do that\n\nAnd some lawyer who really wants to just get his name in the news and thinks he can do a good stab at it if if congress stepped in they would try and take it to the Supreme Court I don't know if it would just get shot down in district court or whatever but there would be an appeal going on and then it would be up to the Supreme Court but um apparently if George Bush is just gonna keep on appointing conservative judges then maybe it'll hold then would that be hijacking the political system of religious ends?\n\nWhat about this argument from psychologists that boys need male role models and girls need female role models in order to mature properly which would be an implication for boys in female gay couple households and girls in male gay couple households\n\n[Inaudible] exactly\n\nYea did he have a relationship with his father?\n\nAnd if it existed all over the place it might not be awkward too.\n\nSo yea gay marriage\n\nHow about in-vitro fertilization? You guys opposed to that? Where the fertilization happens outside and then the fertilized egg is planted inside to grow\n\nWell they they do a lot of that like there's there's ladies in India who take like thousands of dollars just to carry pregnancies the egg's not theirs the sperms not there they didn't actually have sex\n\nIt just they like and then the same couples who do that will pay like twenty-five, thirty thousand dollars it to find like to find like an egg donor who has SAT scores above this\n\nAnd has all these and goes to an Ivy League school and does like all this stuff like I took summer classes at an Ivy League school and there were like there were like egg donor advertisements around for like girls to make like $20,000 or something like that\nTo take all of these like hormones and all this stuff and then somehow big needle I don't know\n\nIt was crazy it was really weird\n\nAnd then just ship the baby to India where the baby can be had and then ship the baby back or something\n\nYea\n\nYea yea\n\nGenetic profiling that's a whole other question genetic engineering, genetic profiling selective breeding\n\nSo in vitro fertilization yay or nay\n\nYea\n\nI think if I were that child I'd have quite the quite the little identity crisis going on\n\nI'd be like so wait who's my mom? Who's my biological mom? Is it the lady that carried me or the lady whose egg I came from and neither of those are you so bye like\n\nYea\n\nI mean I know who kids who say that they I mean I know kids who are just like who are just like crazy sometimes and they just say they have like big like a lot of psychological issues come from the fact that they were adopted and that's just from adoption\n\nI mean it seems totally logical to I mean cause cause abortion is one issue and gay marriage is another issue and this genetic like selective genetic testing thing and abortion or whatnot is another issue so it I mean it it makes a lot of sense to draw the line and say that that ya know selecting whether or not you're gonna have an abortion based on genetic factors before you ever know the kid that seems immoral but but at the same time at least in my opinion like there are instances in which an abortion might I don't want to use the word justify but in which people do have very strong convincing reasons why they don't want to have that child like they can't offer the child a good life something like that but it would take so it's just so not feasible that society and that like the lawmakers would ever arrive at at a line like that or a compromise like that when they're all just kinda bitching at either other to to get press attention for issues like this\n\nI guess \n\nYea which is which kinda sucks it does\n\nExactly you can't\n\nGenetic testing for downs syndrome or for like autism\n\nIs is more common but what about like if you're gonna open it up to that then are you also gonna be able to open it up to genetic testing for like hair color eye color stuff like that?\n\nYea and the people who are are like I don't know I think the people who are doing that they should they're not ready to be parents\n\nLike they shouldn't be parents cause they're not ready to deal with a kid and they're not ready to love their kid or they are but conditionally\n\nYou're gonna not love them are you gonna like send them to a concentration camp or something?\n\nLike that that's just\n\nYou can't do that no\n\n",
        "Yea  I think when it does exist it has more to do with the mentality  and an attitude  that you  like you said  that's kind of left over  from an older period  um  like  human society has been structured on  like  a paternalistic kind of mode  for  practically as long as it's been around  um  and I think that's only really started changing to any great extent within the last 100 hundred years  and I think because of that  while we've come along way we still have a longer way to go\n\nLike  male oriented\n\nLike in terms of  like  a male hierarchy  almost of things  like the women are the ones who stay home and take care of the kids  whereas the men are the hunter-gatherers  stereotypically\n\nYea  I think that change to a post-industrial economy has had a lot to do that with that  cause  since the economy is more service oriented now  those are jobs that don't have as many stereotypes associated with them  and like you were talking about  even today to a certain extent people still associate  the  job of a nurse with a female and associate the job of a doctor with a male  even though that isn't necessarily true  when you actually look at the numbers \n\nThat's a long stage  til they're 12\n\nYea  that's like a Mercedes \n\nThat's true even in like  Fortune 500 companies  if you look at the CEOs of all the Fortune 500 companies they're still by and large predominantly male positions  and  I mean  I think part of that is leftover because  I mean  it's a lot of white guys who have those jobs if we're going to be perfectly honest  and I think a lot of those are holdovers from a previous generation  I think that'll change gradually\n\nBut you do still see it there\n\nUm  I think that Dole ran in the last election\n\nBut she didn't get the Republican nomination  and  um  I forget what her name is  but somebody ran as a candidate for Vice President on one of the major tickets  in the early 90s, late 80s I would say \n\nYea  Nancy Pelosi \n\nYea  she's\n\nI was excited about having a women in that job  but  I don't really like Nancy Pelosi\n\nUh  like a month ago\n\nWithin the last election the Democrats got the majority in the house \n\nUh-huh  she's the first woman to hold that job\n\nHarvard  I think Harvard just nominated their first female president  too  of the college\n\nI've only met like two in my entire life\n\nAnd come from a family of  like  nurses\n\nCause there definitely is that militant branch of it  but they're also like a lot of feminist literary critics and art historians these days who are doing like revisionist histories of things  which are kind of useful cause they're looking back  at like early art works  early pieces of literature and pointing out ways in which  they  there's this embedded mind  paternalistic mindset  like  like we mentioned earlier  and I think that's a useful function  that's not necessarily the same thing as just carping  I mean \n\nRush Limbaugh's Femi-Nazis\n\nWe Rush Limbaugh the political commentator who I hate with a vengeance\n\nUm  he coined the term Femi-Nazi for extreme feminists  that he doesn't like\n\nYea \n\nYea\n\nI don't know  I think it's interesting how a lot of the majors around here  tend to be male or female dominated  and  I don't know  depending on what they are\n\nLike  I'm the  last time  I'm an Art History minor  and  last time I checked  all the Art History majors were females and I'm the only Art History minor\n\nAnd Speech Path too\n\nI mean  I guess you could expect it to some extent cause there is a higher percentage of females on campus in the student body  but  like  when virtually all of the majors in one particular discipline are female  you know  that's a big difference\n\nUh-huh\n\nThat's cause guys wait longer to take classes like that \n\nBig sunglasses\n\nGuys were supposed to wear Timberlands for a while  I don't know what happened to that\n\nI can't pound back 12 beers\n\nI don't weigh that much\n\nIt's a double standard\n\n\n\n",
        "Um  I think it's important for them to modify their policies since there's so many  or there's such a shortage of priests  but, at the same time they have to measure how much change they really wanna do because I mean for them to stay constant is really important  because it's such a large like institution  global\n\nWell, um\n\nWell, yeah. Some changes like  like that  that wouldn't effect essential like theology of the Catholic religion  but would appeal more to like modern society\n\nYeah  I mean I would agree with that. I'm just not sure why  um  that's there in the first place  or what's the like origin for that  I mean that might be important to Catholics to keep that  I mean I'm Catholic but I'm not even sure why like priests can't marry\n\nWell, you have to take it from the perspective  I mean like in theology class  I had like the same question and my teacher explained it to me  how the church  like if you take the view of the church as in everything they're talking about and everything in the Bible  all their teachings  if you take em to be true then you're gonna want to like save everyone you can  like Baptize everyone  you can in order to save them  so I mean that  to make them change like doctrines like that  like that would effect  I mean I think that would effect their central belief  like things like Vatican two  it appealed more to the followers to Catholicism  I think why they're so  I think why the church is so I guess wary or whatever to change  um  like allowing priests to get married and having female priests is because that's changing more of like the church and like the inner workings of the church  than just like changing like a ritual of like mass  just to appeal to more people\n\nI mean yeah that is a possibility though  that's why they have to  it's kinda like a balancing act\n\nYeah  I mean nowadays it's so much more like lazy  like I mean if you want to be Catholic you could just become Catholic  I mean in medieval times  like also in theology my teacher  good teacher  he uh said how you had to go through this whole process of being Catholic where it would take like years of like study and everything  and also I think  I'm not sure if this is true  um  I don't know around what time period  I'm just gonna say around medieval times again  um  at least like one child from like a family would like be entered into a monastery or something like that  like I feel like  like nowadays there's nothing like that  I mean if a son were to say he's gonna become a priest the parents would go nuts most likely\n\nWell, yeah  if you're doing the same thing every week it loses that special  that specialness  I mean it's just kinda doing the motions  going\n\nYeah  that's like a huge debate in theology.\n\nI think what they officially say is that there's kind of two forms of reality that like the Eucharist has  like it'll have the physical form and then like I guess like the spiritual form if you wanna call it  and they say like the physical form  like over transubstantiation  the physical form stays the same like it stays bread and wine  but the spiritual form will change from bread and wine to the body of Christ  but I mean like that argument itself is kinda  cause you can't really prove that\n\nThat's a good question.\n\nAlso  um  you know they say if they ever allow priests to marry it might lessen the instances of like pedophilia happening  I don't know if I agree with that  cause um for one  um  I feel that that was kind of like expounded by the media and like they made it sound a lot more widespread than it actually was  but also um I think  I mean unfortunately pedophilia can happen like anywhere  in any profession  it doesn't have to be priests like  I don't  I don't know if it would  I don't know if that would be a legitimate reason to go change\n\nExactly\n\nBut, you've got to wonder  of all the cases that have come out into the open  there's stilla bunch that haven't been put out  that you don't know of  I just don't understand the connection  like why priests would do that\n\nSo you think it'll just pass like with the generation?\n\nWell, lessen at least?\n\nIt's kind of funny  cause I mean  wasn't it within the past like half century that the church has admitted that the earth was round or something like that\n\nWell\n\nUm  I mean I think they can't be quick to change with everything because then it'd just trivialize the entire message of the church  it would just kinda be like a fad that just changes with people's views  doesn't really mean anything\n\nI could imagine  like um in some religions  for marriage to be essential  cause like that feeling of love could tie you to even like deeper to whatever God you are thinking about\n\nWell, I think with that  like again to like Catholics  like the act of making love or whatever is supposed to be like the ultimate gift from God  so I mean they just don't want us to trivialize it and just treat it like  you know an everyday thing  it's supposed to be like a gift that you like take with responsibility\n\nYeah  that's kind of trivializing it in itself  I mean  you know  kind of dulling it down\n\n",
        "I mean on one hand I would say that I'd I'd want them to change I'd want them to start opening up and start accepting all these new possibilities\n\nBecause I'd like them to adapt to it but at the same timeI want to say no I don't want think they should be forced to do anything I don't think they should be forced to adapt because I mean you have free exercise of religion which I I pretty much believe in anybody can do what they want like in terms of religion unless it's like too obscene but\n\nYou gotta draw a line somewhere but like if something they're not really causing that much harm to like anybody else outside of that so\n\nI feel it's up to them because some of the issues that they side no against like gay marriage, abortion, and all of that you can you can do that in other religions maybe not legally according to the government but\n\nThere's still a I don't know in other religions they accept that\n\nYea that's one thing I think is a problem in the Catholic Church they think of G-d they're all G-d fearing um \n\nHe's gonna unleash his wrath on you [Laughter] if you do something terribly wrong like all of that but then there's those other religions that see him as this just like kind of a friend as you were saying which is\n\nI think it's a better way to approach the entire situation I mean like if you're gonna see him as the creator I mean he obviously cares about you, loves you and all of that and he wouldn't really want to punish you just for simple things he gave you your will so he expects you to break it\n\nOh sorry.\n\nGo ahead\n\nYea that that the problems with the Catholic Church date way back when and they're still even going on today I mean if you take Martin Luther for an example he basically created the Protestant Church and with his um was it 95 theses\n\nTheses yea he listed all his problems with the Catholic Church like taking indulgences and all of that\n\nAnd some of those problems still go on I mean you still see corruption you still see problems with like pedophilia and all of that in the Catholic Church and it's gotta stop somewhere I mean\n\nYea\n\nBut it's a big of  human nature but I think it also has to do with the Catholic Church repressing like all the emotions that humans would typically feel and then it just kind of gives these people these like little outlets where they try to express those feelings but it always ends up in someway that is wrong\n\nOh the repression of that like emotions and all of that \n\nI think almost in reality because of what actually happened I think it's just because it was like a clash of like the values pretty much in the church\n\nYea I think it's one of the few religions in America I believe \n\nEvangelical\n\nHm?\n\nEvangelical yea \n\nYea it's very rare I don't think I've ever I couldn't give any examples of when it's happened but I know it does happen \n\nYea that's \n\nLike I mean I don't think it's really wrong if you like are raised in one raised an Episcopalian and then like all of a sudden your eyes open up to Catholicism and then you decide to convert and you're already a married priest but \n\nBut if you're just using it for that purpose I mean it just kind of adds to the whole like the problems that we were talking about before like the problems that arise in the church and all of that\n\nThere were a couple of cases I think up around in the New England area \n\nWhere priests were like I don't know like I'm not sure how exactly they were caught if they were like reported by the children themselves or if they were actually like walked in on which would probably be really awkward\n\nYea go ahead keep going\n\nYea that's point one thing I want to point out like people have to learn to understand that it's not the entire Catholic Church like the Catholic Church itself does not support that but then you have these select cases in there which are causing the problems and kind of portraying this image among the entire population cause that's what you'll hear about for the next couple of weeks I mean and just the whole image of the Catholic Church is being tarnished by these couple of I guess scoundrels who I guess are going out there and doing these things which is I mean one reason why you could say that the Catholic Church should change it's ways because this image is getting out there and it's not what the Catholic Church stands for so they really should try to solve the problem before it even gets worse and I think with the day and age like progressing and all of that and all these new like I guess contagions coming out there's only so much you can hold back\n\nI think it I think it would actually help it because I mean with a marriage you're able to more or less express yourself a lot more rather than living in solitarily\n\nYea\n\nYea I don't think it's so much of them actually being pedophiles it's more of the act itself it's an act of pedophilia but I don't think they're actually pedophiles I think it's just that they have all this built up in them they've been living in solitude for so long I mean how much longer can they hold it in they get to the point [Laughter] they get to the point where stuff like that happens I mean where as if they were to have a wife they'd have that outlet and it'd be a safe outlet and I mean it wouldn't be something that's going to impact someone's life forever like tarnish their life\n\nYea definitely\n\nYea it's way too conservative\n\nAnd plus you gotta think about it's roots I mean it's roots poke over across the seas so this and that's pretty much where like most of the Roman Catholic religion and all of that come from \n\nAnd it's much more prominent over there so you have to think if it doesn't they don't really I guess you couldn't really say they don't have the same problems that we have but they're not really expressed as much over there as they are over here and \n\nI think it's just because of like a difference in society like where we grow up we grow up with all these like outside pressures and all of that and all of it just caves in\n\nHm?\n\nYea the media is a lot different like \n\nThis is a very commercial society so even if you're a priest you're gonna be exposed to some of that I mean you can't live your life in just like living in a house and not see any \n\nNot see any advertisements anywhere or hear about anything\n\nYea\n\nI mean even in the context that it's doing it I mean it's still portraying this image and it's still gonna be \nYea\n\nHow can you really tell if they're Catholic or not when they come up for Communion?\n\nOh ok I get you now I thought you were just talking about mass when they get in the line\n\nThey don't really say anything \n\nYea I grew up in the Catholic Church and I just found it way too strict so\n\nI'm not really anything now I consider myself agnostic but \n\nUm you don't you don't believe but you don't like disbelieve you don't just say like there is no G-d it's not like full blown atheism or anything like that it's like I'm still open to new religions and all of that I'm still listening trying to figure out just which way I want to go  \n\nSo I was I\n\nYea my grandparents go to church every Sunday they used to have to go to the church when they were little kids everyday\n\nBecause their parents were that strict about it\n\nYou just accept it all for fact\n\nYea that's actually a tough question because when I don't know it's just kind of all in the back of your mind when you're when you're thinking about it to yourself like when you're thinking about why you want to do this or not but then once you're once you're out of it you just kind of forget all of that [Laughter] forget what actually made you tick\n\nI don't really think you could say yes or no to like an issue like that I mean\n\nYea\n\nYea and I think it really depends on like the situation at hand like depending on your lifestyle like if you're someone who doesn't have an income like isn't really living off of anything and all of that and you don't have the money to afford something like that like having a taking care of a child\n\nLike it's just a really tough situation to be in because you're just stuck with that I mean I know someone back at home she had her baby when I think she was maybe 15 or 16\n\nAnd she still has her but she's fine she has a job and everything so she's working it out but there's other people out there who wouldn't be able to do that and who probably don't have the resources to like figure all of that out on their own so when they're stuck in the situation where do they go from there?\n\nI think it's\n\nNo I think it's somewhat expensive but it's less expensive than taking care of a child for \n\nYea\n\nI think in an illegal abortion which is not safe\n\nYea that's terrible but\n\nI don't even want to think about that one.\n\nI think you can be both I mean if the Catholic Church were to open it's open it's doors to new like new situations at hand that could possibly spring up but if you wouldn't have that problem because I mean if they were to just take a neutral stance on something like abortion and let it up leave it up to the followers I mean condone it but don't like pull this \n\nYea just \n\nSee it as a sin but not as something terrible that you're gonna burn for eternity in hell\n\nYea\n\nI don't know there's some places that I think they'd consider it a sin I mean I live near Lancaster, Pennsylvania\n\nWell both I would say \n\nIn taking anything like that I mean \n\nLike yea I live near Lancaster, Pennsylvania and that's near Amish Country and when there's like a restaurant that I go to down there and they always these little pamphlets in there it always has like why you should quit smoking and then it goes all into this explanation about why G-d doesn't you to smoke and all of that and \n\nNo I just [Laughter] I skimmed over them some of them were kind of funny though I mean just some of the stuff you'll see in there like they talk about like parties and stuff and why you shouldn't go to parties\n\nI wish we could change that\n\nYea why you should live in a farm without any electricity\n\nPretty much not to diss that or anything\n\nI mean but I couldn't do that\n\nI think I saw that\n\nAnd when you grow up with that I mean that kind of becomes your lifestyle when you go out into the open you're not gonna be used to that you're gonna be uncomfortable therefore you're not gonna enjoy as much\n\nI was trying to keep it somewhat on topic I mean trying to reel people back\n\nYea\n\nYea I pretty much agree with him that they should change I mean it's definitely part of their survival to change but I don't no I don't think they will I mean it's really tough process to actually change the Catholic Church considering how large it is and how it's all across the ocean it's that huge hierarchy\n\nMost of us ain't gonna kill nobody off of it so I feel like with if they don't change it this new generation that's coming in with the new things we're accepting, with the new things that we're doing they're gonna lost this new generation\n\n",
        "Uh-huh\n\nI kind of feel the same way because I mean if you look at TV shows and stuff you only see you see like only a couple black not just like black women but just like women in general like that's in um power and it's like I feel like men still have like sometimes it's it's like an unspoken like I don't know idea or something that's within them and they feel like you're inferior to women who are not even inferior but like intimidated by women who make more money or do bigger things than they do so how what can we do to change it? I'm not a big change person yet so come back to me on that one\\\n\nI used to\n\nUh-huh\n\nI don't even know what paternalistic means.\n\nOh\n\nYea I have a problem with that I mean I just feel like women should have the same I mean in being that men and women are both humans it's like it's not I mean yes there's like genetically cause I'm a bio major so yes it's like genetically different like things about how women can't do as much as men can but that shouldn't be like the basis of everything cause just like a lot of things now women don't even get a chance or at least women didn't get the chance and now they're more so so women are kind of creeping up and you have women now that just came out and was like you know what I don't like this I don't like that I have to just sit at home ya know that's not really like me being a nurse I just I mean wanting to be a nurse I just really feel like that's it's still although our like position but it gives so you still have advantages to a doctor who's like who usually might be you have like a male doctor like sometimes you can even tell them what to do sometimes so you still like I don't know the whole male dominant thing but it's changing a lot you can actually see it changing a lot though\n\nI don't really like honestly um I love kids love them to death [inaudible] but when they're at that stage when they're like 3 to like 12 and they just can't stop talking and I cannot stand that stage at all\n\nSo I want kids to be born and then become adults\n\nI know they just keep talking \n\nYea\n\nA small car\n\nYou really kind of hear it on TV\n\nIt's like nothing something you really hear like in like I mean I feel like it's like once again like an unspoken thing like you know \n\nIn like computer science you see like 2 females and the rest are all males\n\nIt's like male dominating subjects surprisingly now in my class as um a bio major it's um usually like all men do this like bio is a science but now it's like a it's like now the class is like 3 males and the rest is all females so it's like changing gradually though\n\nIt's cause of our generation \n\nYea\n\nI feel like if we came back to this in like probably a good 10 years\n\nYea I don't even feel like\n\nIt would be like a discussion to talk about it we'd be like yea that was back in like the 50s this is now that's not how this ya know\n\nI mean there's still I feel like if you really look at it's like a big like 180 it's like back in the 1950s there was like a good 100% stay-at-home moms and then now it's like a good\n\nYea\n\nYea you do there's a lot of stay-at-home dads now and I feel like if you have more of that gender discrimination of ok you have the men working and then the women not really working it's that creates a lot of problems in the home especially when it comes to education and like seeing well the husband's like well I make the money so therefore I can do whatever I want with it that creates like a lot of different problems and stuff\n\nYea\n\nAnd now we have a what's it called? Speaker of the house or house representative or something \n\nYea oh man I was excited about that \n\nAnd a Democrat Wooh\n\nYea\n\nAnd the Democrats just have the have the majority for the past 12 years\n\nYes it's so beautiful I'm so excited\n\nDo big things \n\nWhat does Femi-Nazi mean?\n\nIs that like the connotation he's put with like women and like if a women tries to proceed like a man's job she seems like a butch and then ya know they're kinda looked on like really intimidating and if a women tries a guy tries to proceed like a women's job or what's characterized as a women's job then they're like well ya know why's he he's a little feminine there why you trying stuff like that\n\nAnd it's sad because it's not giving people any freedom of like choice at all it's like ya know they actually well people have the freedom of choice but then they're like well ya know they're gonna get looked down upon by even family cause ya know as much as some like families say ya know go out and do what you want if you do what you want and it's not exactly what they wanted they'll look at you like ya know whichever way if you're a butch or if you're a little bit like girly or something like that \n\nYea\n\nYea\n\nThere weren't a lot it's like everything's kind of like \n\nYea it's like you still have some of those like extreme jobs where not a lot of people have ya know not a lot of men and not a lot of women but it's like gradually everything is kind of starting to go over now and starting to change a little bit\n\nUm\n\nI'm a bio major.\n\nNot actually cause right now we're just kind of taking like we're not taking like the upper level biologys yet we're just kind of taking like the lower ones where everybody if they want to be a bio-psych they don't really have take as much um of the upper level things but now surprisingly I know in chemistry and I know in organic chemistry surprisingly you see a lot of females now I'm not in it but like I've heard from experiences like there's just not a lot of um males are in that and it's really surprising well all the cause I think like all the um all the teachers all the professors are all um males and a lot of\n\nIn bio and even in well not even bio so much but chem chemistry it's not really I don't even think there's any chemistry female chemistry professors \n\nI know the one girl you're talking about [inaudible]\n\nThis campus got Hilly and Timerlands are heavy  but as you can see I am far from um I mean Uggs and all that other type of stuff but I feel like that's that's like and during the summer well I don't know I'm not really like a dress up person especially during the winter time but I think \n\nYea but during the summertime or even during the spring I feel like it's gonna be like a complete like real fashion show on this campus like everyone's gonna be really dressed up and like ya know really trying to put on like their best outfit to come to class with which I don't understand too much but\n\nYes\n\n[Inaudible]\n\nI don't even think it's like not even with dating but it's like even just like trying to like trying to get a girl when you're out at the mall or if you're just out in public then it's like it's always expected of the guy to kind of come up to the girl and be like hey, how are you doing? Kinda ya know just \n\nAnd then but it's like also like opposite like if a girl tries to do it then the guy's like what the heck are you doing? Ya know \n\nYea there are but I just I don't I feel like that's like a lot like why cause a lot of guys are really upset like you know I can never get a girl and then they get all mad at it and I'm like if you made it seem like it was ok for girls to actually come up to you not make it seem like if you know like we're all butch and we're not objects trying to come up and talk to you then it might be a little bit different \n\nYea\n\nI think that's kind of changing\n\nYea it's I mean \n\nYea it is because I mean now it it depends though because if you're like with a group of girls or whatever and you know those girls and they know that you go out on a lot of dates it like you can go out on a lot of dates and hold yourself really well at all times\n\nAnd you just like to be you're kinda like a date person you always want to go out always meet new people but it's also about how you hold yourself and usually the stereotype that's associated with girls that go out all the time are the girls that kind of go out and give it up at the same time and like ya know\n\nYea\n",
        "I don't really think it's that really invasive cause  to me MySpace is  the tell all  be-all type of website  you put it up there cause you know other people are gonna see it  so I think it's almost like  I'm crying for help being like this is what I'm gonna do  someone should try to stop me  and  I don't know  I don't really have high opinions of MySpace  so \n\nI think it is.  You have to request like someone\n\nI don't have it but I think that's what it's like. \n\nYea  I agree with that a lot. \n\nIt's kinda like the  modern way of doing like camps during like World War 2  putting all the Chinese people or Japanese people into like those camps out west  instead of just putting them in all one location you let them be where they are but you still monitor them  so it's  I agree  it's like racial profiling  it's an invasion of privacy  um  I don't know  like  sure there's like safety precautions and like terrorists that we should try and stop  but  that's not like the only ethnic group that is a terrorist [inaudible]  some people are blinded to that \n\nLike you would think they should get some type of like  warrant  if they want to do that  so that at least some other party knows what's going on  and like \n\nI know.\n\nBut also  Facebook's a bit different than MySpace cause it's got all these privacy like \n\nkeys and things  actions you can incorporate  and turn on  so that's more of like  I guess you creating your own person webpage  and only allowing some people to see it  I guess kinda like only giving out your cell phone number to certain people  where as like  MySpace doesn't really have that  from what I hear\n\nSo  I think  there are certain things you can draw the line at  like  I would draw the line at Facebook  cause like  it's as inclusive as you make it to be  whereas like MySpace  not so much \n\neach individual thing that you have up there  like  your  ya know  all your contact information  or  pictures  blah blah blah  anything that's up there you can put  like  different limits as to who can see that  I think you can even go so far as to like specify people's name\n\nlike specific people's names that can't see it\n\nI don't think you can [inaudible]  From what I've heard though it doesn't\n\nYea \n\nTelemarketers\n\nThere's a number though you call \n\nand you have your phone number taken off  so \n\nyea  I don't know  I don't think you should have to  but you do\n\nYea\n",
        "But the war didn't accomplish that.\n\nBut is it worth it to keep fighting a losing battle?\n\nWell, we're not gaining anything. We're just losing lives basically.\n\nI think part of the problem is that no one like really presented a clear goal and the American people don't really have a good idea of what we're trying to accomplish, so all we see is the bad stuff like we see people dying we don't see their \n\nI don't know if the media would want to represent a negative view though why would the media want to represent a negative view?\n\nYea, but people would be encouraged by seeing positives\n\nIf something good happened, they'd still talk about it.\n\nBut, if something like undeniably good happened you would hear about it and I don't think we've heard about anything like that\n\nThe only like feel-good stories you hear about are families in the United States doing things for people who have lost someone in the war not like anything good happening over there\n \nFor what reason? Do you know?\n\nI was gonna say like I think it's hard to keep on believing in the war even as you originally started because you don't see anything good like you need positive reinforcement to keep on doing something and even if you saw no negative and you just saw nothing\n\nBut, why?\n\nAnd since we see so much negative we just like reject\n\nAnd even with the increased troops and stuff you would expect if things were going well then increased troops would make things better but since things aren't going well there hasn't been any improvement\n\nYeah, that's true.\n\nI think it's like a pride issue like you don't want to\n\nYou have to think whether being over there is good for you or bad for you. And, if it's bad for you, just leave and don't stick it out\n\nDoesn't outweigh the good yeah it's not worth sticking it out to look like you can handle it\nThere's more to us than the economy though.\n \nWould you vote for Bush again?\n\nOk. \n\nReally?\n\nI think people just hate her personally.\n\nDo you know like what happened? \n\nOh my gosh.\n \nAt least he's making an effort to improve\n\nI think people don't like him because he can't admit that he's wrong like he thinks that people think he's not doing enough so he just does more but it's like you're using the wrong approach and you have to fix that\n\nHe could try at least.\n \nThank you for being a good dentist. \n\nOh my gosh.\n[S19] Wait, so how do his parents feel like about him being an American soldier?\n\nMmhmm. Do they see it that way?\n\nProbably a sensitive issue.\n\n\n",
        "And it falls on the individual to you know lead their own life not make excuses for anything\n\nI think employers today just care about skills. They don't have time to deal with gender discrimination because like if you have a woman with the same skill set as a man or even a better skill set if you reject her and hire the man you're company's going to be worse off because you didn't hire the \n\nI think it's important to note that there are just some jobs that favor men or some that favor women like if you're a cosmetics you know dealer you'd probably take a woman over a man\n\nAnd there are some people that will complain about gender discrimination if they can't get that job, but it's just because they're not suited to it.\n\nRight, so it goes both ways.\n\nI think it's a pride issue. Like the man for a man to have his wife make more than him I don't know just from the beginning of time the husband has like gone out and caught dinner and all that so society's adapting I don't know, it's just \n\nRight\n\nI think the feminist movement sometimes tries to find conflict where there is none. They'll see men as the enemy and you know it's just not the case\n\nAnd men and women will just fall under different jobs like nobody's forcing men to be more predominant in like engineering that's just the way the chips fall\n\nRight\n\nI think there's an issue of like other countries maybe viewing us as weaker just because of their voice on \n\nThere's also the issue of a woman being the Commander in Chief which is just I don't know in my opinion most generals are males so I don't know maybe a woman president wouldn't be able to understand I don't know I'm sure they'd be able to understand but I don't know what I'm saying\n\nI think you have to keep in mind that you know people can vote for a man or a woman so\n\nIncluding women\n\n[S3] I don't.\n\nAlthough it has happened in other countries like in Britain with Margaret Thatcher in the 80's she was Prime Minister that seemed to work\nRight, I'm not saying [inaudible]\n\nWe're a much bigger player.\n\nI think the feminist movement had it's place maybe fifty, sixty years ago but today I mean they've closed the gap so much \n\nYeah, right.\n\nAnd there are men too who will fight for women's issues\n\nLike um abortion there are men who are pro-choice so\n\nI don't know if you can actively change it. It just kind of has to happen.\n\nMaybe, the world will never you know see women as equal\n \nCustody\n\nI think that stems from the uh father being the primary bread winner as opposed to the women who just stays home\n\n",
        "I think it's kind of like a bulletin board that's like being angry for somebody reading your blog\n\nOr something like that \n\nAre you talking about the students from her school?\n\nOk\n\nThere's a big difference between what private schools can do to their students and what public schools can do though because\n\nYea with the MySpace situation I think it was a public school.\n\nYea they have a they have their own little domain\n\nThere was an incidence at my high school where um somebody cause I went to a Catholic high school too and somebody created like a mockup webpage that was a parody of our home our high school homepage \n\nAnd they took like the school seal and like made it a marijuana leaf and everything and the administrators found it and the kids got suspended for a really long time\n\nPrivate \n\nOf plaid\n\nIt just seems to be that there's a difference in forums like if you're writing in your diary or your journal that's one thing]\n\nBut when you're posting that kind of stuff online like you said anybody can see that or anybody can access it so \n\nUm\n\nI mean traditionally the the like in [Inaudible] Law and stuff like that the line has been the difference between private and public forums as to what school administrators can look at when making those kinds of decisions like um there have been a lot of cases about like people wearing in t-shirts and stuff like that to public schools and that's a form of self expression but at the same time it's inflammatory and while they might not be trying to commit an act of violence you know they are provoking other people to that so ya know that's a tricky line to draw and I think it's gotten more complicated because of the internet\n\nAgain a private school though they can pretty much go through whatever they want because they technically own the bus and and anything on the bus they have they're able to search because that under the law like private schools can go through your locker at a whim where as public schools can't do that\n",
        " Do you think it might have been an outlet for people's emotions after 9-11?\n\n And we owe our souls to China \n\n because yea \n\n Yea\n\n And China's financing all their debt so we owe them we owe them like a huge credit card\n\n Projected yea\n\n Have you guys ever played jenga?\n\n Imagine if\n\n Imagine if like the one like block in the bottom was a crack pipe and you were like crack is so bad I need to get this crack pipe out of there and you pulled it out and the whole thing came toppling down like it sucks that there was a crack pipe in there but the crack pipe was keeping the jenga things up and the [inaudible] regime sucked they did horrible things they gassed their own people they were terrible but like they maintained some kind of order and now that we've pulled the crack pipe out of the jenga pie and we took the [inaudible] regime out and made it illegal and like killed as many of them as we could like the pieces are fighting with each other on the ground like the Sunni, Shiites, Kirk  hated each other\n\n I don't know \n\n Well like I mean yea like that's why we went into Afghanistan was to get Osama and like\n\n And we tried to pay off all these warlords to track him and they actually like let him out the back door when we invaded and then we invaded Iraq so now we're on both sides of Iran like ha-ha-ha you guys can't do anything like we can actually invade them\n\n That almost sounds like Vietnam.\n\n A lot of people it's a popular thing a lot of people are doing lately it's um and you know the majority of Americans really don't give a shit \n\n Yea I like just learned about this in political philosophy there's this dude 200 years ago it was like once you people are all comfortable none of you are going to care about anything else and it's true cause like all of those middle eastern countries are the same like no one even really cares at all so that means that whoever's at the top just gets to do whatever they want as long as they make a good argument for it because no one really gives a shit\n\n If something had to be done in Iraq then something has to be done in Darfur and something has to be done \n\n Well yea you gotta start somewhere I mean\n\n We're the world police. \n\n But like the UN is just an expression of how powerful countries are outside of it anyways like if the UN tells us to do something we're not gonna do it like I mean the big bullies are still bullies on the floor of the UN just as much as they could be in the rest of the world /like they had the UN made this thing called I don't know if it was the UN or who it was but it might have been I think the UN had something to do with it it was the ICJ the International Court of Justice and one day basically I think a lot of it had to do with one case too we just decided that we were gonna withdraw from compulsory jurisdiction which means  we say oh well we don't have to do what you tell us to do anymore and I mean what's the UN gonna do about it? \n\n Well but that's because you thought they had enough weapons to blow your house up \n\n [Inaudible] for for years\n\n And we still haven't secured the [inaudible]\n\n There's still dudes digging tunnels and little cubby holes in the mountains and we're just like sitting around the mountains like they're up there somewhere oh it's a shell better watch out for that like\n\n Yea but Saddam Hussein was a nut job anyways\n\n Like he didn't when we attacked he was like he he was just delusional like he buried his fighter jets in the sand cause he thought he was gonna have to fight us no he thought was gonna have to crush yo first of all he buried his fighter jets in the sand so that he could use them after he won the war and the bridges that go into Baghdad over the river the U.S. all thought he was gonna blow them up and booby trap them no he kept them there so that after he won the war he could suppress an uprising in the south of Iraq and as a result we were just like psht ok and we just rolled over the tanks and rolled right into Baghdad \n\n And like like he was just a wacko\n\n But just cause he's a wacko does that mean we should've taken him out\n\n Well then we have a lot of wackos to take out we should get cracking yea\n\n We do\n\n Coalition of the willing \n\n The reason why like one of the big reasons why they proposed reinstating the draft this is a quote from I don't know what senator but he said that he proposed the bill to reinstate the draft so that he could get college students off of their IPods and onto the streets to end the war just like they did in the 60's that's why he proposed that though cause if they proposed a draft  who would go? No like some people would go\n\n Well some people would go but college kids especially would blow up and that's nothing new \n\n They they draw all the days of the year out of a hat and the first one they draw you're gonna get drafted the last one they draw like if that's your birthday you're gonna get drafted \n\n if they draw your birthday\n\n The stipulations to get out of it you can be a conscientious objector you can flee or or in the 60s you could do it on academic grounds which basically meant if you were rich enough to go to college you could \n\n but yea there's so many more kids in college and all the college kids would that that would that would give us like then we would start giving a shit about the Middle East\n\n Like I I'm actually I think they should reinstate the draft I I really do\n\n Yea because that would\n\n That would get people to wake the fuck up\n\n Because then because then it wouldn't just be like oh it's someone else's problem it's across the world oh well three more dudes died this morning \n\n Suicide bombing in a marketplace anyone want to go to Primo's?\n\n It wouldn't be like that it would be like this is bullshit we're not gonna take it \n\n Ya know?\n\n Well it might it might\n\n Like like we should get rid of all the nutjobs and wackos who kill people but who's gonna pay for it \n\n I mean someone should get rid of 'em we can all agree someone should get rid of 'em but but would you would you work 40 hours a week and and give up like all your money just a hypothetical situation and give up all your money in taxes to go get rid of all the wackos in the world\n I mean like that's probably what it would take\n\n Cause it would take a lot it would take a lot that we ya know we might think we have it but we don't have it\n\n No it it is but but if if someone was to take all that money and then make a military and then go get rid of all the wackos you'd basically live in a dictatorial military state and then who gets to decide who's the wackos cause then then you have a whole country where all anyone wants to do is fight and then who gets to decide what what battles we pick how we fight them how we do that we would be fighting all of the time\n\n Well it's our problem right now\n\n If we pullout I honestly think they'll keep on fighting amongst themselves\n\n I mean like all the people say well like it will become a safe haven for terrorists well duh you blow people's houses up they're going to hate you \\ \n\n Like I know a kid who goes here he's from um Serbia a couple of kids who go here from Serbia and they're like yo I love living in the United States I got ya know I'll live comfortably I go to school with awesome people I'm getting a great education but when you guys bombed my neighborhood yea I fucking hated all of you\n\n At the time\n\n Ya know it's just irrational emotions like we were talking about before like the reason that we went in to begin with\n\n Yea\n\n Like you break it you buy it\n\n And we broke it and now we bought it and \n\n Oh no no\n\n Yea\n\n Once we hit Baghdad pretty much\n\n But I mean like do you know how hard it is to build a country you have to get millions of people to all agree on a lot of things\n\n And if they've hated each other for almost 1000 years\n\n Right yea yea \n\n Yea I mean and people say we went in for oil we didn't go in for oil \n\n The Iraqi oil industry is in shambles they can't do shit right now\n\n Like you're from the city right?\n\n You're from Long Island but when you go into the city you take a bridge you take the Queensboro Bridge or something like that yea imagine if in addition to waiting inline for the toll booth you had to wait in line almost like you're crossing the border into Canada and there's a checkpoint and they needed ID from everyone in the car and they searched you imagine what a nightmare it would be to get from Long Island to New York\n\n That's why a lot of Iraqi's despise us is because we like for security reasons we setup like all these checkpoints which I guess work cause we net all these criminals that we're looking for but they hate if you're trying to get to work you're trying to commute to work and you have to commute through a checkpoint and there's like a five hour wait at the checkpoint\n\n Yea\n\n But if you break it you buy it and I I just think next time before we we break something we should really really do the homework first\n\n To see what it's gonna be\n\n Well we didn't really anticipate all of this I mean we had a plan kind of but like I mean I think in the end what I think could definitely happen is like Condoleezza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld are gonna fall on their own swords if you know what I mean they're gonna be like alright yea it was our bad sorry it was our fault\n\n Yea but that's that's the purpose of instating the draft because right now \n\n Nobody gives a shit nobody cares if you walk around on Maryland Hall and you ask people what happened this morning in Baghdad there there could be like four families that got blown up this morning like families mothers daughters kids and they got blown up cause of all this violence which is going on and I'm not saying it's our fault it's not our fault these families got blown up but like that's important and nobody here gives a shit like a kid from my high school went down in a helicopter in Afghanistan this summer\n\n And like that was the first time that anyone in my town even like looked up from their coffee and doughnuts\n\n to see that there was a war going on cause nobody cares cause we're real comfortable and cause we have a great country to live in with a lot of great things going for us economically so we don't have to care\n\n So we're it's like that way right now\n\n Yea\n\n Yea\n\n We're I mean yea why shouldn't social issues take priority? \n\n They should I agree they should take priority but they're not gonna take priority because that would be socialism  and poor people are lazy and all this stuff and that's and those things aren't gonna take priority like a couple space shuttle missions that amount of money could probably end homelessness in America but it's not gonna happen because the people who have the money like the 1% who control 46% of American assets they don't want to give that up cause they feel so entitled to it they feel like they worked for it\n\n Well and and a lot of them did but a lot of them made it by really really really really really working hard doing things like cutting costs which is an impersonal way of saying paying the people like it was just basically an impersonal way of saying squeezing the lower end of the pay scale taking bonuses at the top and increasing your revenues like I'm not even if those people did work really really hard it's not their fault it was just their objective to to make money and they did so by like concentrating it\n\n I mean he\n\n Right the only way I I will respect Bill Gates if he does what Rockefeller did and if he does what Warren Buffet did \n\n And when he dies he's like fuck it take all of it\n\n I don't even want it just put it somewhere good cause when you're talking about that amount of money you can you can do something \n\n Yea\n\n Oh yea\n\n I mean yea I guess Bill Gates just rode the computer wave all the way to the top cause he got on early and he was like PCs are gonna be huge in like ten years \n\n They were towards the end of the war they got real sick of it \n\n There were a lot more casualties\n\n A lot more causalities and also like we we had a president at the time who did like great things socially along the lines of the social problems like we wouldn't have Medicare or Medicaid if it wasn't for LBJ but like everyone pointed their finger at him and said this is your fault you bastard when in reality like JFK was the one who really in in terms of like in terms of the denominator by which or in terms of the coefficient by which people raise the [inaudible] when they came into office and left JFK came in with like 200 military advisors of  the 12 and then got assassinated and then LBJ just like took off and then finally Nixon came in and like and [inaudible] but like I don't know people just got fed up with it and we're not that way yet we could be if if it really drags on people could very easily get sick of it the other thing was the draft \n\n The draft mobilized our demographic at the time \n\n Ask your parents about it.\n\n Absolutely these are questions that just don't have answers\n\n",
        "Yes\n\nUh-huh\n\nYea\n\nUh-huh \n\nYea I don't think that we can really say that we can actually legalize gay marriage because is it really illegal in the first place I mean it's really all up to the church I think they're just trying to force like make it illegal and that's the problem here but yea like what you were saying with like it's civil rights like yea we have to learn to accept it because it's going to happen someday and sure there's gonna be a lot of issues leading up to like like when people start seeing these couples with their kids their kids will be ridiculed I mean but it's really part of the fight part of the struggle to finally get this put into place because you can't really make change without a fight so \n\nI think that's one of the ways it has to be done\n\nUh-huh \n\nUh-huh\n\nYea because in all honesty I don't like I feel that the government doesn't really have a say in like who should be allowed to marry and who shouldn't\n\nBecause you were saying earlier that they have the right to\n\nYea \n\nYea they can't I don't think they can make a law because that would um that would defy the constitution separation of church and state\n\nSo that's why that's why um they're trying to push an amendment um\n\nFor the ban of it\n\nNo\n\nYea states are I think um states can states grant the right to marry\n\nYea\n\nIn some foreign countries it's encouraged it's\n\nYea\n\nYea\n\nI think that's one of the problems that\n\nLike that like the current government has with the gay marriages because they want to kind of like right now America keeps progressing and thriving and they want to keep that up and they figure that if they allow same sex to marry then there won't be like the reproduction that we typically have and it will cause some kind of like little like bump in the progression and I just think that way that and like their views are really traditional and they've grown up with this like like they've grown up Christian or any belief system that doesn't believe in um same sex marriage and they just want to stick straight to that rather than trying to amend to their beliefs and they just I don't know they just have this like mindset from way back when and it's just kind of stuck with them and they're extremely against it like I want to point out one example um the I I forget what the church is called but it's run by a guy named Fred Phelps and it's basically \n\nYea G-d hates fags that's their basic slogan they just have this far off belief that the bible strictly says that same sex couples aren't allowed like homosexuality is like a great sin they completely they I don't know they're they praised um what was his name um Matt Shepard he was beaten to death outside of a\n\nYea he was beaten to death outside of a gay bar I believe by three men they basically they created a monument to put down I think maybe in Alabama or somewhere that um Matt Shepard entered hell on this date and I don't know that was I just think it's mindsets like that that keep it way out there like\n\nI think it I think it could be a combination of both because I mean like there's two chemicals that really separate like males from females and that's testosterone and estrogen and I think like depending on like what amount of each you have in your system cause everyone has both but like depending on what amount of each like that could also alter like your mind but then like also like your environment will have an impact on that obviously if you hang out with all these guys and you're a female for your entire childhood and you just kind of grow up like doing all these guys things you're gonna grow up feeling like you're part of them part of male society and you're gonna I don't know I think that could tell people all of it but just I think it could be a combination\n\nThat's why I think it's probably like a combination of the both those factors\n\nLike that could really have an impact and to kind of as a kid deciding where you want to stand like if you want to be part of them be one of them or you actually want to be yourself and just be like different from the group be like um I'm trying to explain it in a different way now\n\nLike yea that's really\n\nI also think it's a really bold move to try to put in an amendment that's going to contradict the constitution from the separation of church and state and then instantiating this amendment that says oh but no this is what marriage is because this is what my beliefs say because I mean that's kind of pulling the church into the into the constitution and also that's that would be the first amendment that really restricts the people rather than restricts the government\n\nYea\n\nUm yea I want to agree with you on that point like it it definitely is discrimination against a certain group of people based on something about them their character\n\nAnd I don't think I don't think that's right at all I mean you can't really say that one person is better than another and deserves this because they're this way when this person doesn't deserve it because they're homosexual I mean that's just really just I don't know restricting a person who was born equal into this country and if you're gonna say they're born equal into this country you should provide them with the same opportunities as everybody else and I think marriage is one of those opportunities that everybody well most people seek marriage in their lifetime and when you're trying to restrict that it's just it's definitely discriminating just as bad as racism in some cases\n",
        "With the way I understand  it was more than a war on terrorism  but also  to try and bring democracy to the country that was under that tyrannical rule for such a long time  and my basic  um  outlook on this  pretty much the same way as yours that I  I agree with the purpose and I agreed with it early on but it just seems  not to be efficiently \n\nIt's a drain on our economy back home \n\nJust had like a 1 trillion dollar surplus in their budget\n\nYea\n\nBut wouldn't you agree that something had to be done over there?  I mean  you mentioned that we totally broke everything done even though there was some sort of order  but  without breaking something down  I mean that sounds cliché  how could we ever build it back up?\n\nI agree  there's stuff that need to be done all over the world  but you gotta start somewhere  right\n\nI mean  if not  somebody  like the UN really is not gonna take any action  they're just more of a \n\nThey're not gonna take action  I mean  what if you were\n\nI don't think they really have that much power to actually take action  so much as just\n\nA group of countries that'll make decisions and say  this is our stance  they can't really  send  they don't have an army to send to war\n \nRight\n\nI just think if we were one of the citizens over there in that situation  wouldn't we want somebody to help us  I mean  just \n\nThose are the people that would be shooting us  that are in the war with us right now  and that's part of the problem \n\nThat's why I think it was really a kind of like an irrational move on their behalf \n\nAnd it didn't really put a plan together  and just to  sort of appease the American people  they knew they had to do something  and that's why it's just out of order right now\n\nAt the same time  the emotions played on them\n\nExactly  that's why I think it was pretty irrational and based on emotions\n\n\nYea \n\nExactly  so  whose gonna help them?\n\nIt wasn't just us initially [inaudible]\n\nNot too many are capable  I suppose \n\nWhat other rules as far as the draft  do you have to go as a college student? \n\nRight right right\n\nI just mean as far as the stipulations to get out of it\n\nThere are so many more kids in college today.\n\n[Inaudible] like what we were just talking about \n\nGranted  it doesn't take a draft to do that to everybody\n\nThat's ridiculous \n\nAll my money?\n\n [Inaudible]\n\nBut there's a lot of wealth in here that just seems to be beyond moderation  that  just like  I mean  us going to Loyola College right now  40 grand a year  and  that just seems ridiculous\n\nYea  I think there's a good argument on either side  of the \n\nOne way  it's just eating away at us domestically but on the other side  if we  pullout  it's just gonna build right back up the way it used to be\n\nI mean  we broke it down  something's gotta get it going on the right path\n\nThat's true  but  I mean  it's really not a reason to say  alright  go back to the way it was\n\nJust because we haven't gotten it right yet  I mean  we haven't found a cure for AIDS yet  but were probably not going to give up for that \n\nI'm not saying I have the answer for how to finish it off\n\nBut I don't also  I mean  I don't have an answer either way\n\nYou could defend each argument pretty well\n\nExactly  it's just eating away at our resources\n\nI don't know about that\n\nWe still deal with that at home with the airports  right  but not quite as extreme  but \n\n[Inaudible]  finance it \n\nNo  not at all\n\nYea  that wouldn't go over well at all  I mean  you talked about\n\nbeing a good leader  you gotta please the people  all the people who would be in that draft  I like  imagine the vast majority  have nothing to do with it \n\n Force them to think about it?\n\nBut at the same time we have  At the same time  not to downplay that  cause I completely agree  maybe four families die over there  but you think  probably like  hundreds of families die here  [inaudible]  poverty  or  something that we could take of here\n\nI mean  what are we doing to raise awareness to that? Some sort of poverty draft to force them to think about it  what are we doing on our own turf as well?\n\nI agree we should have awareness here just as much as we should have  Yea \n\nExactly \n\nYea  I agree with the whole Warren Buffet thing  just giving up the entire estate  keeping enough  probably  a little bit more than enough to live comfortable\n\nBut still  there was a ton left over  to help out society\n\n\n\n\n",

What are the odds  like two thousand kids in my public school  like nobody in sight  like obviously yeah it's ridiculous\n \nKind of  Well, because I mean I did both of you go to public school?\n\nI went to public\n\nWas it like a boarding school or was it just private?\n\nI don't know  I think with a public school I guess since the lockers are technically school property  that gives them the right to search lockers  I think as far as backpacks and cars go  like \n\nNo  after a school dance  one kid when into a school dance drunk  bad decision, yes  but like his car was parked in like the school's parking lot and so they like broke into his car and opened up his trunk\n\nYeah  they searched his car  like without his permission\n\nYeah, exactly. My school they  my town basically they\n\nIt's not even just the school  it's the whole town and police will take advantage of you not knowing like a law like in a heartbeat\n\nThey're come into your house if they think you're having a party  they'll come into your house  they'll arrest everyone there  even if you don't invite them\n\nCause they're stealing his car\n\nLike  I don't know I think if it's like personal property and no one has the right to search it without a warrant\n\nYeah, but even with like what  stuff on Loyola's campus  like Loyola can come in and search your room if they want  like this isn't our property  it's their property  they have every right in the world to come and search it  but if I have a house down the street from the campus and they want to search my house they can't because it's my house\n\nSo, yeah if it's the school's property go ahead They do it anyways with or without your permission  so\n\nAnd like I know a girl who  her  freshman year her roommate um got in trouble for credit card fraud or something like that\n\nI know, and like no one else of the roommates had anything to do with it, but like Lo-Po was kinda huge dicks about it and was like we're searching your room with or without your permission  if you do it with  like if you let us do it now then you can stay here and watch and ya know  so she was like fine you can search it not knowing that like they don't search her room  like if she doesn't want them to search her room\n\nYeah, she didn't know she could have said no  but if she let them search her room like she had a locked trunk in her room  they made her open it and like how would her roommate like get into her locked trunk\n\nYeah. But then afterwards  um  like a couple days later she came back and her room was completely trashed cause Lo-Po came in and searched her room when she wasn't there anyways so\n\nI think that's kind of crossing the line because you can's say one thing\n\nYeah\n\n\n",
        "I don't have I either.\n\nI think if you post anything on the internet  the whole point of the internet is that it's world wide  like  you can spread information and if you put something on there you have to know that people are going to be reading it  and \n\nI mean even if you were to say that they somehow like  let's say you had to be  friends with somebody on MySpace in order to see it and then  ya know  the school official like used somebody else  like got to it by some weird way  I think even the fact that they saved people's lives  like  that's more important than the fact that this kid's privacy was invaded and somebody read his MySpace\n\nCan you say that again? I didn't catch that.\n\noh \n\nPersonally  I wouldn't really have a problem with that because  I mean  I  if I'm like talking to my friends on the computer or even on the phone or something   if some government official who doesn't know me is listening to that  I mean  I would rather them be able to possibly like be able to catch a terrorist than have them listen to me talk about what I'm gonna wear or something stupid like that  like  I would hope they wouldn't really be spending their time listening to conversations like that \n\nAlso going back to the MySpace thing  um  like  I don't exactly where I'm going with this\n\nbut  ya know how  um  they always have people saying how  like  oh well this child was murdered because he met someone on MySpace  and blah blah blah  I don't really think it's an invasion of  well I guess we already established that  invasion of privacy like that whole thing  because it is public  and  it's kind of like when you see police officers listening in  or like IMing people  like we were talking about  is IM  like a closed conversation between two people  well yes it is  but also like  what happens if  the  I don't know where I'm going with this.\n\nI don't know  ya know how they like catch people  like  being like weird or something  I guess in that case\n\nYea  I don't know where I'm going with that  you can just \n\nYea  right.\n\nYea  and someone else is listening in\n\nI think that's like the default  but then you can go in\n\nYea\n\nyea  you can really specify it  so \n\nSo then do you think they should be able to get in trouble because of that? \n\nYea\n\nAre you talking about the school or the country?\n\n\n\n",
        "There's no like real law against invasion of privacy either  like\n\nAnd if they have a reason to inspect which they obviously did  it's gonna save people and like\n\nBut, come one.\n \nYeah\n\nNo.\n\nJust the teacher was drinking.\n\nHe just took a picture with the teacher and his beer.\n\nI think the difference is  like whether it effects other people or not  threatening to kill someone is safety  what you do on your own is what you do on your own\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nThat's kinda dumb.\n \nCan they see part of it though?\n\nOk.\n\nThat's Hobbes.\n\nAnd if you're like a law-abiding citizen  you're not really giving up anything anyway.\n\nIf you don't have anything to hide.\n\nThis is kinda a little bit off topic, but  just concerning privacy  what do you guys think about employers looking at Facebook?\n\nI don't think it's like a very fair basis for them to like hire you or not hire you based on what they see on there.\n \nThat's true  yeah  they have to compare it to other college kids  cause you know you cant compare it to the employer that you only see in the work place.\n\nUm  well I agree  I don't think it's a good way of determining whether you should hire somebody or not  um  cause it doesn't really reflect how they would be in the workplace  it's like their personality  it's not like their characteristic\n\nIt's not to impress people.\nI think checking places  like checking public domains \n\nIf you're like looking through someone's voicemail, it's a little different.\n\nIt's totally lawful  to look on someone's Myspace so I think that's fine\n \nWell, it does take effort, but not too much.\n\nWe had like an uncover [inaudible] in our school.\n\nShe was like in one of my classes  she like  there was a bug drug bust\n\nI don't know  I don't think  they weren't very public about it\n \nOh my God.\n\nWe had to put paper on that little thing  that little glass thing\n\nI think you're paying for your rights.\n\nI went to public\n\nBut  I mean  I guess maybe  well did you live at your school?\n\nDid you\n\nOh yeah, I do remember it.  Just like everyone should have the same amount of rights  it's like a human needer  whatever human rights  it's  not  a case by same thing  like this person goes to private school so they get more or less rights than this person \n\nThey broke into his car?\n\nLike fifth amendment\n\nThat doesn't make it legal to kill someone\n\nOhh. She didn't know she could have said no.\n\n\n\n",
        "Alright yea\n\nAlright yea I do think that it's still an issue in the present day United States I mean you still see that there's a difference in wages like different earnings and stuff like that and you still see all of these um stereotypical families that were setup I mean back in like the 1950s where you have the father who goes out, goes to his business job and then wife who stays at home and like takes care of the kids, cleans the house or whatever while he's gone and I mean these still exist today in in some places not a lot has changed since the like back in the 50s when suburban like housing started becoming really popular and it started portraying all these images of the family on through commercials and through television and stuff and I just think that in some places not much has really changed where as in others you do see more women getting out into the workplace and everything like that and everything starts to like it's picking up pace gradually but I still don't think we've reached the place where we should be in terms of equality\n\nNo\n\nI think a lot of the change really has to do with their like all the all of like the technology increases and all of that because now that we're in this period like this day and age right now we have all these other options out here like there's jobs with computers um and everything like that and really you can't specify a gender to that I mean if you look at like history and all of that you see ok like I don't know like hunting and gathering that kind of stuff all the physical labor it's mostly associated with the males but there's really nothing you can argue about when it comes to like business or any of like anything like anything in the business industry or any of that stuff so like it really\n\nYea so it's really hard to like have any justification for discriminating when it comes to that \n\nYea plus nowadays with like\n\nWell that works actually too because nowadays with like prices of like college and all of that\n\nYou can't really have one person making the money and then paying for the children to go to a good school or whatever I mean\n\nYea practically impossible that's like half of like it's probably like our tuition for a year is like someone's annual income\n\nYea\n\nI wouldn't even say a small car \n\nGender discrimination\n\nYea \n\nYea \n\nPretty much\n\nYea it's\n\nYea it's definitely becoming more of a choice nowadays but I mean you still have these like unspoken kind of taboos like taboo practices that still take place in the workplace like you still see these um I don't know like I don't want to get too political but like far right wing conservative people like who are all stuck up on like traditions where the male is kind of the dominant role like just choosing to pay different \n\nA lot different\n\nYea back to what you were saying about um how it's also because like some women won't pursue that \n\nLike you were giving um that they'll go for like vice-president and stuff like that I think also part of that might be caused because like it's in a way it's discouraged not like through school or anything like that but just like by being presented with all these images of the male in that role like both genders get that kind of idea that like oh it's discouraged that women should try to pursue this and therefore it becomes like a mindset where they choose not to because they don't feel like it's in their league or anything like that \n\nYea it's not really a spoken discrimination though but it is discrimination I mean like you you see like a male nurse and you just kind of laugh to yourself I mean like meet the parents\n\nHe was a male nurse and everyone just kind of laughed at him\n\nAnd that's really true I mean like someone says they're a male nurse you're gonna even if you don't think about it too hard you're still gonna giggle a little bit in your mind I mean if you don't like say anything to them but you're gonna think that's kind of weird\n\nOh yea \n\nYea I think that's I don't know the way that feminism had evolved I think as where first it was more fighting for the rights of women now it's just become we hate men\n\nIt's like instead of working together it's more of fighting against and it's kind of just it's only furthering the discrimination it's not really helping anything because then you have the guys who want to retaliate to that and\n\nYea\nYea exactly that too um because like when you have these like more militant like branches of feminism it like I don't know like you there's some people who see that as oh that's what all feminism stands for so therefore they'll see like the that women trying to advance themselves is a bad thing like these guys like in the higher powers they'll see these militant feminists and \n\nThey'll just assume that all women are trying to do this and takeover so they're gonna become more kind of I don't know discriminatory and try to keep it the way it is rather than allow too much change\n\nOh yea \n\nYea I think it's now becoming like it's now becoming an issue if you're like butch or if you're gay and all of that if you just try to pursue something that you want to do even if it's I don't know it normally appeals to the opposite gender \n\nYea \n\nNanny\n\nYea it makes it harder but I mean you can make observations\n\nHmm\n\nI think when it comes to something like language it's more of a split decision where as it comes to like \n\nSomething like that you're gonna major in that you're gonna do for the rest of your life you see those you definitely see those differences like as a computer science major like I think there's I think there's only one other female computer science major and I mean\n\nYea \n\nWe have a very small like group but like just the fact that there's only like one girl out of like everybody I think there's there's at least 8 or 9 guys in there and it's just\n\nYea there's just that ratio there if you look at that and compare it to other majors it's really a good amount like nine to one is still big gap\n\nI don't even think that the discrimination um in school and stuff is restricted to the just classes I think it also has to do with like the social scene and all of that like the way you act, the way you dress or whatever is typically associated with like your gender like guys are supposed to act a certain way girls are supposed to act this way and I don't know \n\nI don't know like\n\nLike I don't know like on this campus I really I guess it depends on what school you go to\n\nOn this campus in particular like girls are supposed to dress all nice I mean \n\nExactly yea\n\nAnd guys are supposed to wear like the polo shirts um\n\nPop the collar maybe\n\nYea I even think I even think the actions like of the people like I don't know one thing that I want to bring up is ok the drinking scene like the guys they're supposed to be able to pound like 12 beers and be like oh I just have a little buzz and then the girls take like 2 shots and they're like falling over like I just feel like that's an image that like many people have\n\nYea\n\nYea again I don't probably I don't know\n\nYea I think there's a lot of pressure when it comes to that especially for the guys because that kind of thought is definitely out there like oh it's the guys move the guy's supposed to be the one who does that not the girl but I don't know I think there's certain things that each like character is supposed to do towards that\n\nLike the girl's supposed to act a certain way and the guy's supposed to pick up on that and kind of make the first move\n\nYea \n\nWhile we're talking about that like just the whole like dating thing if you when most people think about a girl who's dated a lot of guys they kind of say oh she's a whore but if a guy has dated a lot of girls they're like oh he's a pimp he gets all the ladies he's cool like\n\nYea it's kind of applauded as opposed to looked down upon and yea \n\nYea that's definitely slowly changing\n\nUh-huh\n\nNo\n\n",
        "Oh you don't know that it might just not have been \n\nI don't know\n\nThat's because you're raised that way.\n.\nVery true. I know a lot of people ya know that they say they're catholic and they do not show it at all. \n\nJust catholic by name \n\nI mean I'm catholic but like I'm going to mass after this  to get my ashes for ash Wednesday  I mean that's  I can actually say I am because I actually do the actual practice.\n\nWell yeah  you need to lead your actual life\n\nWell just throwing this out there  when you receive that's basically saying you're forgiven of all your sins.\n\nWell, ok\n\nWhy not Muslims?\n\nThis is news to me  uh\n\nYa know what  this is how the people nowadays are more lenient  ya know if people aren't catholic, they're not gonna go to hell in my opinion\n\nIf you're a good person  ya know  goin to hell  no  that's bull crap in my opinion\n\nYeah, totally.\n\nNowadays, it isn't like as strict  like we don't have nuns like pray now in class.\n\nOh really?\n\nSome of it's true.\n\nSouthern Baptist? Is that what you're trying to get to?\n\nWho's that Indian guy that like beats people on the head?\n\nI believe that  well first of all everybody always picks on Catholics  I mean what the crap stop it\n\nNo  but\nYeah  well I mean you gotta be able to joke about yourself in order to joke around with other people  that's ya know  I joke about the catholic church all the time  uh  but I believe that it is a religion  why should you change your religion to suit people's wants more so than needs. Why should the catholic church change for people want gay marriages  they don't need that\n\nEverybody's pickin on us Catholics\n\nWell I mean it is a religion like I said  um  can you repeat the last part that you were saying?\n\nThat's for another discussion\n\nIf people have a problem with it  I mean they can convert  I mean they don't need to change the views of the entire church just because of their views.\n\nI really don't care how many people are catholic. I just want the religion to be the way it is  cause that's what the people believe\n\nI really don't care how many people\n\nI never even considered that\n\nEspecially with all of our ways\n\nAs in like the way people doubt worship nowadays  the people used to be like memorize prayers, kneel down seriously, you never crack a smile  Nowadays you break out the guitar  all that stuff  it's just a lot more liberal way of worship\n\nNo, I'm talking about in the United States.\n\nWait  what? Can you repeat that?\n\nWell I mean it'd be nice but\n\nWell I mean everything's weird with change\n\nWell that's just general in the world today. Guys generally get more respect than women. And that's not in the U.S. That's in the entire world.\n\nNot even a hundred years with the \n\nThe Latin masses were set up til like the 60's or 70's.\n\nYeah. Everything was in Latin  couldn't understand a word\n\nAnd I mean  I'm not  probably goes back to discrimination but only males were priests probably for some reason when religion  actually ya know what  I take that back  I really don't know\n\nYeah  that was the culture so it may not have been a really terrific reason but on the other hand it may have been.\n\nLet's go back to the  uh  respect issue that you brought up.\n\nI feel as though  as though a majority of them probably would have been prevented  um  but I mean that's just a personal issue for those priests  I mean they're screwed up in the head.\n\nIt's a pretty thick line\n\nI'd imagine unmarried.\n\nJust cause they're not getting\n\nThat's still not a good reason to be a pedophile.\n\nYes, that's a good point.\n\nNaa. He's probably messed up if he goes for a little boy.\n\nThe church doesn't necessarily need to change their views in my opinion  uh  they can however change their ways  in that  um  when the priests do go um before they are priests  when they do go to become a priest  um  ya know they obviously need to go through changing  they don't just oh you're a priest  they obviously need to get tested and everything  but um  maybe if they tested them more so  I can't really explain it  on um how they generally tend to flow  um  be more strenuous in that area obviously that would limit some  uh we don't really have a good flow of people going to become priests right now  this would obviously diminish that even more which stinks for us  but obviously that's worth getting those creep shows out of the church  I wanna smack em' in the face\n\nYeah,yeah.\n\nNeed like a lie detector or something\n\n\nYou guys think like psychological tests more strenuous to become priests would be a good idea?\n\nYeah exactly  but ya know the way church doesn't exactly need to change it's views to please people but they can change their ways in that process  it's not really changing their religion  just weeding out the good from the bad\n\nSounds like an army commercial\nWe already do have a low flow\n\nIt's like a very sexual oriented society we live in today so that's obviously like a main reason why people don't want to become a priest  on the other hand that's also what is giving priests the trouble  so that's another thing to look at  anyone wants to expand on that? Cause I really have nothing to talk about.\n\nOr maybe priests marry the female priests?\n\nI'm not gonna say anything cause I know I'll upset my grandfathers  all that stuff  up in heaven  dead silence\n",
        "I still think legalize it\n\nBut, again though if I mean along the same lines as people not smoking if marijuana was legal like legalize gay marriage I'm not gonna like girls it's not gonna all of a sudden change me to oh now that like it's ok to get married I'm not even if it is a choice I don't think anything I don't think legalizing gay marriage would make anyone's choice different\n\nNo, I agree with that, but I feel like as much as I don't feel it's ever going to be a hundred percent choice. I don't think they'll ever find that out. I don't know, and I mean I really don't know but they have come so close to finding that it is something genetic and just I mean even I just I don't know I think that even if it was a choice, that they should be able to\n\nI mean I'm not thinking like it's a choice to be completely honest but again I didn't even study it, but I'm kinda not thinking it could be a choice maybe its partly choice but again I mean its not like you wake up one day you're like, yup same sex today it's not a choice like that you're attracted to one or the other or sometimes both but one or the other you're attracted to male or female\n\nI think it should be the same  its actually yeah I think 18 is the legal age, but again\n\nAnd, also with like the marriage I mean I understand there's also like a legal side to marriage where it turns its like a union and you're together and you have all the rights of the same you know give them all the rights you want which I feel like the only restriction should be the same way it is with heterosexual couples you need to be 18 or have permission but you need to be 18 to get married. Why is it any different? Why are there all these other stipulations? I mean really what a wedding I mean besides the legal like I said you stand up in front of everyone you know and you say I love you and they say I love you back and you have a party you know what I mean? and really, like what is so wrong that we have to tell them they're not allowed to have that? That's why when there's like commitment ceremonies, and things like that and they do they do the ceremony part without the whole legal they know they're not legally bound to each other, but you got the ring and you stand up in front of everyone and you say you love each other like what's so wrong that homosexual people can't do that too?\n\nNo, I think it's like it's still like saying, well I'm gonna get married, but you're not good enough to and it's not like a question of good people or bad people you know it's not like it doesn't make them bad people it doesn't make them bad eggs and especially if they find out its not even a choice they have you know like and it's the same kind of thing like oh you have brown hair, you're not allowed to get married, sorry you know like one of those it's the same kind of thing it's a genetic it's a genetic thing\n\nAnd now, I know that even like legalizing gay marriage obviously wouldn't necessarily mean they would get married in the Catholic Church ya know I mean like ya know but so it's the kind of thing that's like what about letting gay people get married it doesn't really affect like I'm not affected by gay people getting married like it doesn't change anything for anyone else its allowing two people who love each other to be united\n\nAnd that's what I'm saying, you tell them they're not allowed to get married there are gay couples all over the country who live together, who adopt children and only they're not only one name is on it and that's like another slap in the face too is that this is your child and you both are the parents of it, but actually only one of you is legally responsible for this child and then in other cases of um gay couples there was a case when I forget exactly what it was, but whereas one person one of the I think it was two men and one of the men was in critical condition and his partner had no say over what was gonna happen to him, or what was going to you know I think he was on life support, and he had no say in anything that was going on because he was just for all they knew he was just a friend and like your friends don't have any say in that so his parents were the ones making the decision, but the guy kept saying like I know what he wants and we've been together how long and he doesn't have the rights to then do that when he's probably the one who knows him the closest just because they didn't stand up and say I love you in front if people\n\nOh yeah. You can't do any sort of things in a lot of cases you can't and even in the case of adopting a child just as where you are a heterosexual couple I mean father and mother both sign you know and alright well two adopt a child, but when you're a homosexual couple then only one person is responsible for the child you're just another person you know when you're not even no one even looks at you as a parent of the child you're just another person in this child's life you have no say over it\n\nAnd it's even now more accepted too where they're one thing wasn't it would be weird if you were like so draw a picture of your family and there were two family it was like ooo but then it like starts to become I mean it's so prevalent now that even though it's not legal I mean I have lots of friends who are gay, and I know lots of people even older people who are gay andor lesbian like whatever and I it's really becoming so prevalent and so much a part of it that like I just really don't see a single reason why they should not be married\n\nI mean when it was so hidden, and you weren't allowed to say you were gay. I mean you were allowed, but no one did because they were afraid of what would happen to them and even now I mean now we were talking about gender discrimination things like that I mean gay pride parades everywhere with millions of people, you know? and all those kinds of things it's just so much more of an open society now, that I feel like this would be a perfect time to maybe give them gay marriage I don't see and then again I [inaudible] but I just I don't see it's not affecting me at all in like why how does it affect heterosexual people if homosexual people are allowed to get married?\n\nYeah, if it's a genetic thing then that goes along with genetics like they'd have to I mean they'd have to figure it all out if like you know and I mean also not to be but I mean it's not even a trait that could be like carried on through reproduction because you know what I mean like you're adopting kids anyway\n\nYes, but then they have to figure out exactly how it was \n\nYeah, and if they definitely decided it was genetic they would have to figure out how exactly I mean I guess if that was the concern\nNo, no, it's not like you're going to get a blood disorder that is like carried through generations it's like\n \nOr maybe you'd have to learn \n\nBut, also, what you have to remember to is that like people only have been coming out publicly for not so many years like we've already been saying that maybe this girl's father was kind of pushed into a marriage because he felt like he couldn't be gay at the time so I mean I there are definitely this is not something that just happened all of a sudden people just weren't gay in 1970 you know like so yeah I mean in the year \n\nIn the year hundred there were definitely gay people you know especially if it turns out to be genetic there has to be and if we can go through I mean it's the year 2007 not eight but it's the year 2007 and like we've gone all this time and I don't know I feel like it's just more accepted now so people are worried about it becoming something like that and more prevalent and are we going towards something like that but, it's been going on forever or at least I believe that\n\nYeah\n\nI think it goes along with the same I don't know if it would work the same with other qualities like just because I mean obviously as children of our parents we are a certain part of both of them, but just because one of our parents has a certain quality doesn't mean that we take it that way and I believe a lot of it is nurture and that kind of thing but I don't know if it's possible to raise your child gay like I don't I don't know if that and I really don't know which is why I can't really even answer your question\n\nYeah, which is another reason why a lot of people do think it's genetic because even early on before you even know what sexuality is and before you even know anything they see these kind of qualities and then find out that this child does end up being gay so it's another reason why like you kind of have to wonder is it something that these and I don't want to say like these people because it's not but you know whatever it's something that homosexual people can't even prevent\n\nA lot of times you know you're just like, ooo is he gay yet?\n\nYeah, no one handed him Barbies, and was like you are playing with these.\n\n[Laughter] really we're dressing up again?\n\nIt's the kind of thing too when not even along terms of gay marriage, but if it does turn out to be something that they find to be genetic there are um I have a friend who came out and said he was gay and his parents put him into counseling to try and talk him out of it and uh talk about not accepting your kids but decided they decided that this was something he could work his way out of\n\nRight, overcome the gayness.\n\nYes, and that I understand, but I definitely like of all the people I know\n\nYes, which I understand that, but maybe if they found that it was a genetic thing we wouldn't have I mean there are so many people who I'm gonna use the word hate and it's a bad word but like hate gay people and it's not to say there wouldn't be discrimination if it did turn out to be genetic because there's discrimination against a lot of things that are genetic things in our society\n\nAnd there's always gonna be people who but maybe it would somehow lessen the discrimination because there really is just I don't know\n\nAnd especially in prior generations too like along the lines of like our grandparent's age there's a lot of just because in their when they were growing up it was not that was when you no one was and there were people who were, but you didn't know\n\nRight, however it works out.\n\nAnd there's another evidence for it being genetic because a lot of times even in the case of people um  like your sister's roommate's parents who and I obviously don't know specifically but who feel like husband, wife, having kids is the way it's supposed to be so they almost fight it fight their feelings and whereas not necessarily hiding it because it's legal cause like we said it's not legal and there are people everywhere fighting these feelings but, you kinda feel like that's the way it's supposed to be the natural way you know quote, end quote but, what's the way to say there can't be two different ways [laughter] you know why I don't \n\nRight, and obviously we're never gonna get the entire population to accept it, but you can't get anyone to accept everything. There's nothing that's one hundred percent accepted, nothing. Someone has a problem with everything. \n\nYeah, you can't tell people what they're comfortable with you know I mean, I guess\n\nWe shouldn't necessarily be hating on them or discriminating them because\n\nYeah\n\nAnd, that's definitely understood, and that's fine but I don't know if necessarily that means that the people who want to practice that way should not be able to \n\nRight\n\nAnd I mean it's one of my one of my friends went away to school and her roommate has a girlfriend which again two girls you know and um it was the kind of thing where she said in the very beginning she's like it's not that you have a girlfriend it's that I don't want to watch people make out every night you know that kind of thing she's like doesn't matter if you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend I mean that's not everyone's view, but she has like a liberal view on it she's like honestly I just don't want anything pushed in my face I don't care if it's a girlfriend or a boyfriend I don't really need you to\n\nRight, I'm not really into having not like having to be uncomfortable in my own room because your girlfriend's here and so it's that kind of thing where it and I understand that some people are uncomfortable with the fact that it is the same sex but it goes for the same way you don't really want to watch anyone really like you know so\n \nNobody likes that couple that you go out with and you're like, yup they're together [laughter] you could always tell\n\nOh yeah, and even like I said like the friend that I have that who's parents forced him into therapy like that kind of thing that takes a toll on you when you come out your parents you're like, listen you're the two people that should understand me this is what I'm going through this is what I'm dealing with and they're like, oh no you're not like how do you even if you can't feel comfortable like in your own family how are you gonna feel comfortable anywhere else? and then right on top of it I mean I'm sure there will still be parents who do the same who try and do the same kind of things but, if it's legal and you're gonna be able to practice what you want\n\nLike publicized, you know?\n\nI mean there's no I mean Will and Grace you know what I mean? I mean and really I don't think they're I mean I'm sure if we really tried to think about it we could think of a million shows and movies and everything that you know that has that and even just when you just think about I mean I don't know obviously personally but just thinking of all the people I know who are homosexual and the people that my friends know are you know it's kind of almost just so prevalent in our society that you kind of couldn't even not that we'd want to hide from it but, you couldn't even if you wanted to you can't get away from how prevalent it is in pop culture you can't get away from how prevalent it is in just everyday life\n\nRight, and again they're not forcing people to say now you have to marry someone of your same sex it's not anything like that just want to be able to practice the same things that all heterosexual couples can practice and have the same rights which again that goes back to how we were talking about um adopting a child and rights when if someone is in critical condition so you know or anything like that you want to be able to be like yes that is my wife or my husband you know whatever you want to be able to have the same role that a heterosexual couple does you know your spouse has like a huge role in your life even legal responsibilities and those kinds of things and then to not give them those rights just because you're of the same sex I don't think like it's fair\n\nThat would be really what would I think that would be really what would make it\n\nI think that's the only thing that could be holding them back is that it's not something that can't be avoided that you want to and not that and there are a lot of people that are gay and I'm not gonna say all because I have not spoken to every single one, but there are a lot of people um who would not say that they had a choice or not or have something where they I mean obviously you're attracted to certain people you know you're attracted to certain people if you're attracted to someone of the same sex like how much do you control do you really have over it? Think of in heterosexual couples, when you're attracted to someone like there's not much you can do about that\n\nI don't know specifically, I just know that there's been\n\nYes\n\nSeparation of church and state\n\nYeah, we went back to talking about that too is that I think the church could be I mean it might not be a terrible idea for the government to push the church a little I mean cause there's a lot of things that we said in our last discussion that the church needed to update on, and this is definitely one of them.\n\nLegalize it.\n\n",
        "Yes\n\nUm I guess yea I think it does exist a little bit but I think it sometimes can exist for guys also like just to bring up like the nanny thing like guys no one wants a guy a male as their child's nanny really so I mean I don't find too many stories or here find myself really affected by it that much cause you still see women in high position jobs like I know a lot of people around me the women have better jobs than their husbands and then like on TV there are you'll see different things like the show Desperate Housewives Do you guys watch it?\n\nWell they have like it's just they have I think it's I think women are in the work fields a lot because like um one of the women is was like this high she was high in the business world whatever but then she stopped to become a housewife so it was kind of her choice so I think that that's nice that women are able to now be able to choose between the two\n\nDo you mind it? Just being a girl? Like do you care? You seem like a paternalistic attitude\n\nYea all capable of the same thing\n\nWould you ever want to be a stay-at-home mom?\n\nI thought u were gonna say 3 to 18\n\nIt's hard\n\nThat's a pretty decent size\n\nSo what was the original question?\n\nIn the workplace?\n\nI don't I haven't really heard any stories about gender discrimination in the workplace like firsthand I haven't seen it really I don't I don't hear about it that much\n\nYea I think that's the only \n\nYea I would yea I was gonna say I would kind of agree with that to maybe the gender discrimination is more not really as much a discrimination but sometimes women not reaching for those jobs because they feel like they're not supposed to be because of their like what what is expected of them like just um actually someone was just um a person I work with was mentioning the other day they had like a meeting about how a lot of the higher like the presidents of the things here or like the whatever the higher people are all males and like the women in our school even though there are more of us will go for the vice president or the secretary or the treasurer and they were saying that they think it has to do with a lot of the population here like just for example being Italian almost ya know like the Italian where the is that dominant guy and the woman the woman I don't want to sound bad but like the woman will take the below them just as something\n\nIt would be different\n\nStay-at-home dads\n\nYou hear about a lot of stay-at-home dads \n\nUh-huh\n\nYea I can definitely see that. Has there ever been a women um to run for President besides now Hilary Clinton thinking about it?\n\nDole?\n\nIn the early 90s?\n\nWhen did that happen?\n\nOh so it's she's\n\nIs that why they applauded her I remember watching the State of\n\nOh\n\nSo it's already changing.\n\nOf the college?\n\nYea\n\nIs there a second part to the question or was it just that one?\n\nWell I think sometimes the men men can be discriminated against in the workplace like you said with um um that you want to be a nurse like in the nursing like it just looks sometimes funny when you see a male as a nurse it's like oh ok\n\nUh-huh\n\nI guess that would be yea a discrimination\n\nBen Stiller\n\nUh-huh\nI'm sure there's probably some very feminist women too who would be but discriminate against guys just because \n\nThey think all women are or have been dealing with it so but I think that's kind of unfair\n\nYea it's like fighting against them \n\nUh-huh \n\nI don't know if there's anything else to say\n\nWell I kind of think almost but it's what you said because of our gender we're more inclined to do things is that how you ended it or\n\nI kind of I guess would agree with that because I don't think that there's many women that would want to work in construction\n\nAnd I don't think there's many men that would choose to um \n\nYea be a nanny trying to think I was gonna say hairstylist or something but then I had there's so many  it's so I think but back in back then would there be as many men hairstylists? No right? So everything's kind of starting were there or \n\nMixing now\n\nUh-huh\n\nSilence Gender discrimination this is probably hard cause we're not really like in the work place\n\nIn school\n\nYes they are\n\nThat's like psychology I'm doing a lot of psychology class\n\nUh-huh and I think that there's maybe 4 or 5 guys in my class\n\nWhat are you?\n\nBio? Are you evenly split? Or\n\nIn the bio department?\n\nBut then like in my Spanish I know that but with my Spanish class like just a regular class that everyone has to take there's more guys\nIn that class \n\nUh-huh \n\nAre you a computer science major? \n\nI didn't know that\n\nYea that is a big gap\n\nGive me an example\n\nJust because I'm a girl I'm supposed to act?\n\nI'm scared \n\nWear a north face, Uggs\n\nPop the collar\n\nI hate the polo shirts\n\nTheir own Uggs I didn't know there were guys Uggs until I came to this campus \n\nI'm lazy during winter\n\nSo if you see any if you see me in Springville on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays I work so I do dress nicer on those days unlike on Tuesdays and Thursdays that's why I kind of feel like cause I'll sit there and like laugh about with some of my friends like oh yea people really get like decked out but then sometimes on like those days when I work I have to dress nicer so I kind of feel like  I just put my head down walking across the bridge um yea but I guess I would agree that there is a gender discrimination as to what is expected of males and females at this school like you said\n\nThat's a good example\n\nThat is a good example because that's exactly how I feel like it's always portrayed\n\nEven if people are pretending\n\nBut in reality I think that can sometimes be opposite well not opposite but like I see some guys who are sloppy messes and they haven't even drank anything and then some girls who are sloppy messes after taking 2 shots for some reason\n\nBut then there's also girls who can out drink\n\nUm trying to think of other ways of gender discrimination what about in um expectations for like making the move on a date I always think oh it's supposed to be the guy definitely like it's a guys job\n\nUh-huh\n\nThere's so many unspoken rules\n\nHe's applauded\n\nI don't like that\n\nI don't like that at all\n",
        "I feel like I feel like it's a little late to be debating the war in Iraq.  Like even like Republican congressmen are like oops\n\num I don't know if were debating this like 2003 when ya know it's actually almost as ya know yesterday four years ago that we entered so \n\nMarch 20th was that yesterday I don't know\n\nbut I don't feel like it's a good topic to debate now. \n\nI mean I guess I got a little speech\n\nlike the war in Afghanistan obviously President Bush didn't care about Osama Bin Laden I mean people in the Bid Laden family living in Saudi Arabia ya know are part global partners with businesses in America that Bush is being supported by we sent less we sent less troops into Afghanistan than the police troops in Manhattan they actually had Osama Bin Laden like they knew where he was in like what cave they were then we withdrew and gave the power to capture him to the Afghanistan government and he's still alive well I don't know if he's still alive but he's certainly not captured\n\nno I mean he might be dead now but not ya know he wasn't captured by anyone he was just died in the caves or something um I also I feel why we went into um Iraq I mean I feel it's pretty like I mean not like obvious but like once you think about it I mean Bush's father during his presidency there was the whole Gulf War crisis and these things never got resolved and ya know his father didn't get a second term and stuff kinda just like petered out ya know Saddam tried to kill his dad so um that's ya know a personal vendetta\n\n[inaudible]\n\nsomething else I just recently read um right after 9-11 um well they found they recently found notes from um some of Ashcroft's um aides like who like taking notes of stuff he said like I would do that all the time and like some of his notes for 9-11hours after it happened was like like use this to things not related like relate this to Iraq like as soon as 9-11 happened like\n\nJump on the bandwagon. \n\n[inaudible] the selection\n\nwell I mean on the Democratic side yea some the Republicans one of the four runners right now is McCain who ran 2000 but he's I mean he's fresh in the sense that his opinions aren't like they're more liberal um and yea I guess I don't want to jump on the bandwagon of like what all the critics have been saying about Iraq but um like North Korea why aren't we doing anything about that \n\nbefore Iraq where we didn't even know if they had any like weapons at all\nI think uh I know just a political uh cartoon that I remember from a couple years back uh you remember the whole mission accomplished thing?\n\nyea I just remember a political cartoon that was like um no actually it was a bumper sticker it was a bumper sticker that said uh quagmire accomplished and like that's exactly what's happened and ya know we still have half the troops there that we went in there with over there and if we pullout now not only is their government going to completely fall apart but they all hate us so we're gonna be worse off and the terrorism is going to increase like where it was before like it just doesn't make sense this whole war doesn't make sense \n\nYea I mean if you look at the people that they sent to clean up and there's a [inaudible] in the scandal and you know all the like government all the businesses that were like going to help redo Iraq were like all friends with the Bush administration like someone's definitely profiting off of this war \n\nI was gonna say something oh I think I was just gonna comment on how I think it's funny how like with how like everything is falling apart this administration is in shambles um so many people had to resign because of political pressures I mean I mean nobody agrees with the Iraq anymore I mean there's a whole ya know there was the Mark Foley scandal awhile ago now there's um there was like the scandal where they like lost 8 million dollars like somehow and they don't know what happened to it and now recently like the um the um attorneys who were getting fired because of um not like refusing to um investigate like liberals under the requirements sent under the Bush administration and now just like nobody supports what's like happening anymore and it I mean it's just gonna lead to like it's already led to a more democratic congress and now most probably a democratic president so \n\nyea I mean one of the main I mean I'm not gonna say one of the major reasons cause people really didn't know but um one of the reasons he got elected was that like the change of administration in like the middle of a war is like it's just not really a good idea um \n\nBut ya know I still wanted him out \n\num I found something interesting online that was like a projected like cost of the war where they had all these elements like little like you could change like if you thought the war was gonna last til 2015 or \n\nand like number of Americans you thought were gonna die and they have it like preset to like what I don't know I'm not sure exactly who determined how long they think it's going to last or whatever but it's like already preset to that \n\nuh-huh\n\nI think a big part of Bush's exit strategy was um like let someone else figure out how to end it\num \n\nWell\n\nHe's probably not going to withdraw this year \n\nI mean um you mentioned like isolationist policy and ya know before Bush we did have a strong \n\nyea and like a strong isolationist policy\n\nit was only like broken by like little things that we had to like go fix little Bosnia-Serbia in Clinton's administration\n\nOf course like years earlier the world wars but um yea something I'm not sure if I agree with the pulling out completely but um talking about like the allies that we would lose if we pulled out like\n\nUm yea we don't most of the world already hates us and the countries that are our allies are either just our allies because we're such a rich country and we have we can destroy them if we wanted to or like or ya know countries like England where ya know Tony Blair's head is so far up Bush's ass it doesn't matter what we do so um I mean I don't think that's particularly a good argument for staying in there but I still think we should\n",
        "Oh my.\n\nWell, there's the opposite too.\n\nThere's the opposite too teaching\n\nIs there really a difference between gender discrimination and racism though? It's just a different kind of racism.\n\nYeah, that's like so like \n\nWell, my grandmother women didn't work in Germany until about 40 years ago\n\nSeventy, thirty baby\n\nIt's seventy, thirty now\n\nWell, I was just thinking that, if I have to think about my classes 8 a.m. class there's three guys my 3 o'clock class, there's two guys it's just there's there's so many more women on this campus\n\nAnd in college in general I went to visit friends and it's the same\n\nWhat class is it?\n\nOh my, yes\n\nI think it goes both ways it's not only women that get discriminated against absolutely the situation just drives me crazy I mean look at look at uh suits between parents who does the child always go with? the mother whether even thought a lot of times the father would be better off it's because a child should be with their mother I don't think that's a load of crap \n\nIt's a load of crap it should go to the parent who can best provide for the child take care of the child and give a loving environment to the child it's it's a different thing between work and  and family situations, but either way the discrimination is ridiculous\n\nGreat\n\nThe bacon\n \nLet's just think about this we always hear about you know the glass ceiling does anyone ever talk about the glass elevator I mean in female in feminine dominated fields a lot of times men will get promotions a lot sooner I mean nursing is supposed to have in particular my friend's going through nursing she's a nurse and I mean all the time there she's been working for about five years there will be men male nurses that have worked at the same place do the same exact job as her she does more work, and they get promoted over her just because it's a male it's a female-dominated field and they need to put more men out there and I mean I think the same thing happens sometimes in male-dominated fields with females not often, but it does happen and discrimination hurts everybody, so\n.\nYeah, it sucks.\n\nIt that's what they that's what they that's what it was done for because the male brain processes certain things better than the female brain and there's different parts of the brain that are used um  I remember reading this whole article on it for my psych class for my A.P. pysch class\n\nIt's both it's bother because um \n\nThat's the it shouldn't I mean standardized testing in general not everyone learns the same way I mean I suck at multiple choice I'm great at essays, but I have friends who are awesome at multiple choice and suck at essays like I don't so well in my psych classes because most of them are multiple choice based classes\n\nIt sucked.\n\nI'm a psych major right now.\n\nI'm a I have a C in my psych personality class because it is all multiple choice.\n\nI um actually our first test was majority multiple choice and essay 75% multiple choice and essay I did not get a point off on my essays, but I got the majority of the multiple choice wrong people test different ways, so standardized testing is unfair to everybody because nobody's gonna get it all\n\nAnd I mean it comes back to the there's differences there are differences between the genders, but there's no reason to discriminate one reason or the other\n\nI remember hearing about this.\n\nNo\n\nNobody does that no one does that women soccer players get paid less than male \n\nEver except for archery archery is the only co-ed sport in the Olympics or anywhere\n\nThere's no difference between the sexes, but \n \nOr the women play five sets but I think there are things that men do better than women and women do better than men I mean personally I was actually have this discussion with my my my boss last week firefighters they have a different test for women and for men it should be the same test as men have to be because frankly if I'm a big girl I'm six feet tall and 200 pounds someone who's no offense like a woman who's taller and slighter I'm sorry you're smaller than I'm sorry\n\nUm but if a woman is her size and she passes the female test, but didn't pass the male test I'm not gonna be comfortable being saved from a burning building by someone who's 5'4'' and 150 pounds because frankly she's not gonna be able to pick me up and throw me over her shoulder, and I think that having there should be the same test I think the women should be made to hit the same there's a reason those standards are there and everybody should have to hit them not just men so I think that's not really discrimination so much as necessary, but I know a lot of people see oh, that's discrimination they're not firemen anymore, they're firefighter, and blah, blah, blah, blah when it comes to stuff like that it's not so much discrimination, and I think a lot of times America's way too P.C. or maybe the world's way too P.C. when it comes to those because sorry political correctness isn't always the most important thing\n\nI mean would you feel comfortable having you know having a 5'8'' woman who\n\nYou know saving you? from a burning building? or you know, tackling down the the the guy who's trying to kill you\n\nHow well the team is doing as a whole\n\nI don't know if it's gonna change as soon as you think as soon as people think\n\nNo offense, but I think still men get that they get that push they get that you know women are still expected to stay home with kids I could never imagine myself staying home with kids never never in a million years\n\nYeah I remember this.\n\nIt drove me crazy when I heard it.\n\nHe said that women women shouldn't be in the math and science fields because they can't understand it they can't process it and they never will\n\nYes and \n\nBut, I mean what's the main goal when you grow up as a guy when you know you're expected to have a job and you know bring home the money and have a family we're expected to stay home with the kids and raise them \n\nRight, I'm not saying every family, but the majority of society I mean I still have people saying cause I I have like a ten year plan for my life, and people are like well aren't you gonna get married? aren't you gonna have kids?\n\nI'm like yeah, but I'm not staying I have a plan like that doesn't like I I deserve just as much right as anybody else\nThat's oh I'm sorry\n\nSo did I, we have the same thing\n\nYeah\n\nYou know what if you want to stay home and take care of the kids, that's what you want to do I am still expected to stay home my family is very traditional you know my my Mom didn't neither of my parents went to college, but my Mom stayed home and took care of the kids and my Dad worked my Mom had a job in and my Dad ended up asking her to quit stay home with us, evn though you know I was nine could take care of my little brother whatever sore spot, but I'm still expected to get married, and settled down and have children and you know stay home and once they've gone to college and graduated, I can pick up my life again and that's ridiculous I think socially that's the main that's still what's seen as socially acceptable for a woman to be\n\nOh, absolutely that's fine, but I don't think that should be the only norm that there is, and right now that is still the socially acceptable norm that's the only one\n\nBut I also think that if people think that if you don't get married and have children you don't have a full life, and if you are a women who's older and have success, but you're a spinster because you don't have a family\n\nJust in general I'm not saying everybody thinks that way\n\nI've never been to the west coast, so I can't really\n\nIndiana\n\nIs that what she wants though?\n\nThat's fine absolutely great she's doing what she wants\n\nActually, my high school the teachers gave that mentality the girls were like do whatever the hell you want my valedictorian didn't go to college\n\nShe decided the past two years the valedictorian didn't go to college she didn't want to she wanted to stay home she wanted to have a family one of them is married already\n\nI'm just not gonna have that discussion right now.\n\nOh absolutely\n\nTraditional mentality\n\nI'm trying to, and you know what I don't date I've never dated, and I get in college people look at me like I'm crazy when I say I don't date and I'm like I have more important things to do than and that's personally for me, that's my choice but, having to explain myself to people for that choice drives me absolutely crazy, and I think that if a guy didn't date no one would I know guys that don't date, I know guys that are very open with the fact that they don't date, but they don't get questioned about it I mean one of my friends is an engineer major he studies, he doesn't date he goes out, he hangs out with us, but he doesn't date, and he never gets asked a question but I'm like oh people have asked me what's wrong with you why don't you date? like I've gotten that question , what's wrong with you? Don't you want to have a family? Don't you want to have kids? And I'm like \n\nOh, I still got asked in high school all the time why I didn't date but I hung out then I hung out with my guy friends they don't date, and nobody says a word so it's it's just this problem there's always problems there's always going to be problems\n\nBut, it's just something that I think more people need to be aware of people don't think about it\n\nBe there\n \nNo, I'd run the other way.\n\nI it's people have tried I've run the other way because I'm like I have shit to do that's more important than frankly dating in college seems pretty frivolous to me because I don't think that you're gonna stay with anybody you meet in college the majority of people the majority of people aren't gonna stay with somebody and it's kind of \n\nThat's that's fine it's kind of my feeling is that I haven't grown up yet there's a lot of changing I'm gonna do in my 20's there's no way in hell that I have the time or energy to waste on something that's not gonna matter\n\nListen, I've had one relationship.\n\nNo, I said I don't date now as in\n\nI never said I haven't dated.\n\nIt was an it was a physically and emotionally abusive relationship I've been through that it's never gonna happen again\n\nIt's just I think that maybe that's personally part of why I have such an opinion about it which is just absolutely possible and probably is, but that's \n\nIt is increasing it's still really nominal because even single parents a lot of times they're still looking for the man to bring home it's still a mentality that's there and it always will be there, but I think that people don't think about it because it makes them uncomfortable, and people don't think about what makes them uncomfortable the don't talk about it they don't think about it they just kind of sweep it under the rug it's there but\n\nExactly no that's exactly what I'm saying all these topics are things that generally people don't talk about I mean I don't know I talk about a lot of this stuff I talk about with my friends, but I think that our situation and our college is I mean not completely because when I said something yesterday about the shooting at Virginia Tech people were like wait, what happened? and I mean this is at eight o'clock at night\n\nI'm gonna agree with you.\n\nDrinking\n\nBut, you know what? I've been to schools that are worse than this.\n\nGo to Ohio State.\n\nGo to Ohio State, go to Illinois go to\n\nPenn State's a huge party school.\n\nPersonally, I hang out with people that do care. I'm gonna make my make my effort to hang out with people that do talk about this we do talk about this this is what we talk about we don't sit around talk about oh you know I kicked your ass in Halo last night once in a while, yeah because I hang out with guys and they play Halo that's what they do, but you know we also like my friend Jimmy and I had this huge debate about abortion about a week and a half ago, and I mean we had an academic completely academic debate and \n\nI do it with my friends I do it all the time I do it with my parents\n\nYou know everyone at that breakfast was sitting around you wasted\n\nand you're having there are people you just have to search it out and I think that I'm personally going to try to make an effort to talk about this with people other than people who are in my group\n\nAnd since I've done this I've been doing it more\n\nNobody says anything.\n\nWhich is ridiculous and I mean\n\nYou'd think they'd put something out in the Newshound although we did get an email from Father [inaudible] which who reads them?\n\nHow many people were there though?\n\nOr was it extra credit for class?\n\nI showed up when I I think the week they were doing all the stuff about the gay gene, etcetera, etcetera I couldn't go to most of them because I was in class, but the one's I did go to the small turnout boggled my mind the same thing with the Holocaust\n\nBoggled my mind do people not care? I mean do they not realize that if we forget these things that they're gonna happen again like \n\nExactly\n\nIt drives but that's honestly that's almost any college any private, expensive college\n\nHonestly, a lot of the community colleges like if I go home and I go to visit my friends up at New Paul's they don't really care either\n\nI'm just saying, there should be people they should care not that it's right that they don't it boggles my mind\n\nI think a lot of our generation just doesn't care.\n\nA lot of our generation doesn't give a shit.\n\nMaybe it's just\n\nI don't think so I think it's a lot of people though I think a lot of people want to ignore it\n\nThey don't want to talk about it.\n\nYou bring up you bring up a subject and like people change the subject like almost automatically\n\nIt's taboo to talk about it doesn't matter it doesn't apply to me\n\nOh Ok did anybody see anything about a I organized something for a self-injury awareness day I did this with Psi Chi \n\nUm self injury awareness day\n\nIt's not this emo 15 year old blah, blah, blah kid thing it's not\n\nNo, self injury self harm um it was like pulling teeth in Psi Chi which is a psychology honor's society to get anyone to do anything\n\nExactly I mean I you're supposed to wear orange just that's what it is we had posters all over campus I saw four people including myself four people guess who those were? Those were my friends those were my friends who could find orange one of them wore a shirt made of orange post-its\n\nBut, that effort needs to be put in by more than four people, and that's anything I mean look at how big denim day is on our campus, and that's just because everybody wears denim everyday\n\nExactly it's just gonna be a normal day I mean it's gotta be something that's that's set apart\n\nOh, absolutely, but see how these topics all blend together? They all have this underlying thing of it effects everybody.\n\nI think we need to start them like I tried to start something last year I tried to start a debating club no one was interested not one person ran it in the Greyhound everything\n\nBut that's horrible.\n\nIt's honestly it's a generational thing\n\nI chose Loyola Ok the people that I knew here that I had met they seemed like the kind of people they seemed like a lot of the friends that I'm friends with now, and a lot of the professors I'm friends with my professors\n\nAnd, a lot of people \n\nMy professors will talk about this stuff a lot of my professors but then some of the other classes I've taken are like they won't \n\nMy psych class now, I tried to bring stuff up about self-injury and he's like my psych professor I'm not gonna say who he is, but literally was just like well that's you know an adolescent problem and I'm very open with the fact that I have self-harmed for over eight years, and I still struggle with it and it's an addiction that needs to be addressed, and I know people who are thirties and successful and have problems with self-harm it's like anything else, but my professor blew it off as an adolescent thing and when someone who has a degree does that it makes it acceptable for kids who are our age to blow it off to not care about the issues, and I think it's not just our generation it's the generation above us that says, Ok only the things I care about are relevant so it's trickled down and I think it's absolutely relevant to what we're talking about because our parents didn't fight about again our parents don't they're like Ok woman is supposed to come home and get married or a man's supposed to bring home the money it's trickled down from them to us, and since it's not a problem with them, it's not a problem for us or to the majority of people anyway\n\nYou know the scary part that when it comes to gender things I've actually had a discussion with my guy friends and they're just like yeah well you know it really doesn't exist and I'm like are you kidding\nLike, you're a bio major you're a chem. major you're an engineering major, and it doesn't really exist? How many girls are in your class? Like\n\nA psych major with a photo minor\n \nPsych generally is a pretty good department here. Most of the professors aren't idiots so you know\n\nOr in the psych department, or in the history department\n\nBut, we have we have good humanities so \n\nHave you taken Dr. Moore yet? \n\nWait. That's all I have to say when it comes to chem.\n\n",
        "Nope.\n\nAnything you put on the internet is public demand.\n\nI mean yeah  I think all schools should do that  sure  [inaudible]  I mean I have a Myspace, I have a Facebook  I don't put personal information  I don't put anything like my own parents to see  like I make it so like I could show like my grandfather or my grandmother my Facebook or my Myspace and they'd be like oh that's cool, dear  I mean you gotta have like  with every  with new technology  you have to keep your head and you have to keep self-control  most of those kids shouldn't even have Myspace's anyways cause you have to be at least 13\n\nI know, but come on. I mean, my little cousin is like 8 and he has one  I mean that's like\n\nExactly.\n\nThey have every right to  and like who's seen that show on T.V.  it used to be called perverted justice and now I think they renamed it to how to catch a predator  that is  that is my favorite show  everytime it's on  cause it's only on once in a while\n\nYeah, Greg Hanson  yup he's like excuse me, how are you doing today, sir?  have you seen our show?  I mean everytime that's on  me and my roommates like make popcorn and we gather around the television cause this is like such a great, great idea  I mean it's so easy and it's just like  it's like fishing with dynamite  I mean just checking these  just checking these Myspace bulletins   I mean   I mean  uh  you can see this example  this kid said like oh I'm gonna shoot my school up Thursday and then watch South Park  I mean it's like on a whim  and if you go and see the pedophiles  it'll be like hey sexy, I'll talk to you later  and it's like a 35 year old bald dude talking to like a 12 year old girl  I mean it's so obvious  yeah I mean like it's what happens\n\nYeah, it's like I said  fishing with dynamite  it's so easy to catch em and it would be a sin for them not to like go on and check \n\nWell, I \n\nThere's a difference because if some kid's goin out and getting plastered on the weekends like what does he do in school?  does it have anything to do with what he does in school?  No  fine\n\nHe was drinking with the teacher?\n.\nMy Dad would like get a kick out of that  he'd be like oh you're a high school boy  you're gonna find that funny  I mean that has nothing to do with like school shootings or \n\nWell, that's a private school. Well, also like with the invasion of privacy thing  you have to like look at what invasion means  I mean they're not going  they're not going like out of their way to obtain information about these students' private lives  all they need to do  go on Myspace, go to their site  oh profile set to private  oh let me see  uh   setup a Myspace account and befriend them  I mean nothing that's going out of their way  this can be done in like five minutes.\n\nIt's just like any like  you have a Facebook?\n\nIt's even quicker than that.\n\nCause with Facebook  to be part of a college network, you have to have a legitimate college email  now I think they opened it to\n\nWell, no, no, no. You can send Myspace profiles to private. That's what I did. So, like Joe Smo that surfs on the internet can't like \n\nThey see your age, location and picture  but I am 75 years old from Kalamazoo, Michigan or something like that  and my profile picture is like the promo shot from taxi driver with Robert DeNiro. I mean like\n\nSo yeah  that doesn't really\n\nYeah, I'd rather not  I'd rather give up some of my  who is that Hobbes? What philosopher is that?  no  it's like give up your personal freedom  there's uh nature is a state of war\n\nThat's Hobbes, right? Yeah  and then you give up uh personally freedom for safety and security to the government. That's what I feel like in this situation  I'll give up some of my freedoms just so I can like feel that warm, bubbly feeling inside every time like Greg Hanson arrests some dude on television.\n\nExactly, yeah.\n\nIt sucks for us, but it's kinda good for them  kinda thing like\n\nWhich it does. I mean, what you see on Facebook\n\nWell, Lord forbid I drink in my life, but\n\nWell it's also like  like when you go to an interview  I mean\n\nYeah, I mean like when you go to an interview and you dress up  exactly like the cowboy hat   the employers  the future employers won't like come to your house on the weekend and like hang out with you as you like  I don't know like kick it back with your friends  I mean my activities under facebook I think are writing weird music, drinking large quantities of milk, and hunting the mice that live in our apartment with steak knives and frying pans\nI mean if\n\nYeah, blowing coke off a toilet seat  that oughta be something like alright well this says something serious  but even if they catch you like with your drunk face or a beer in your hand  they're gonna be like oh let's take this into account  I mean this kid's 19, 20 year old college kid  boy or girl  I mean it's not that   it doesn't deviate that far from the norm where \n\nI use it for the hot chicks.\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nThey shouldn't. I mean they shouldn't  they shouldn't go  like I said before  they shouldn't go unreasonable lengths of like  they shouldn't go above and beyond there  what's like considered normal  and I guess what's like considered normal is  I mean Myspace  checking Myspace  checking Facebook  definitely isn't considered above and beyond\n\nYeah, public domains. Exactly.\n.\nYeah, it's  exactly  like you don't  you don't like hire private detective to like see what the bad kids\n\nWell, but then again  but it is totally lawful to hire a private detective to go and look at someone. I mean you have to  you have to  what's considered like extra effort to go above and beyond to make sure you've retrieved information about the student's private life\n\nYou do think that's goin above and beyond?\n\nWell, I mean it does take effort to like use the bathroom.\n\nI hate to be blunt. I mean like everything takes effort. I mean you have to draw a line somewhere  I mean \n\nWell I got\n\nYeah \n\nYeah, it's the funniest thing in high school. I mean  just at simple, Catholic high school  they heard that like one kid had weird or that like some idiot brought in like a like ridiculous amount of weed and hid it in like their locker  I remember looking out the window in bio class  big like drug sniffing dog like jumps up past the window I look around like did anyone just see that? I thought I was hallucinating.\n.\nDid you really?\n\nWhat drug was it? Do you mind me asking?\n\nYeah  they do that a lot\n\nYeah, well it's private school.\n\nYou went to a public school and they did that?\n\nSee ,yeah, but that's drugs. I mean I still wouldn't consider  I mean would suck if it happened to me or my friends but like of course they wouldn't find anything in my locker but um \n\nExactly  I mean it's like\n\nYeah. I mean like when we're parents  if we ever become parents I'm sure like people would want us to like  like we would want with that stuff happening to our kids  we wouldn't want like kids selling drugs to our kids in school  I mean\n\nYeah  you're not the only one  trust me on this\n\nCatholic high school kids are like awful  I mean I've seen kids  like walk by, open a locker, take out the blank page from the beginning of the end of the Bible, rip it out, and then go use it to smoke a J  it was the real deal which is just like \n\nPages from the Bible\n\nYeah, yeah  I know  it's like aw dude I don't have a bowl  uh don't worry about it  he like opens the Bible and rips out  he takes out the Bible  some random kid's Bible  so the poor kid's missing like Joshua 13:6 or something like that\n\nWeren't we on Myspace? How'd we get on like holy joints?\n \nCode magenta! Code violet-blue.\n\nAgainst the wall, right? \n\nThat's a great idea  I mean that's  that's ingenuity and creativity \n\nWhere did everybody go?\n\nYeah  I don't  I don't know  I mean for drawing the line as far as privacy's concerned  I mean there's real no tangible line  I mean you'd have to use examples and then like you'd have to discuss whether it's \n\nBy  like for example this  I mean the Myspace and the Facebook  I think we're all in concordance there   for the school shootings at least  it was not  it was not um invasion of privacy  but yeah if you go to a private school  I mean yeah  they have the right to do random drug testing  I mean it's a private school  public school  I mean I don't know about that\n\nFor public and private schools? Yeah of course.\n\nWhy should it?\n\nWell, no, private schools  I mean to a certain extent are like a business  I mean they have their own interest to look out for  It's a privilege to go there  I mean you're paying or you're parents are payin to go there  are paying for you to go there  so uh \n\nI guess the grass is always greener on the other side\n\nWait  what are you  did like\n\nDude, our private school was worse than all three public schools, except that it dint have drugs in it  and that was like  yeah  I mean people would come  well it did have drugs in it but like  I mean the thing with the high school was it was small enough  I mean people didn't have locks on their lockers  the public school would come and be like you don't have locks for your lockers  this is not like oh yeah we all love each other  this was like something's gone from my locker and school's small enough that I can find out who and kick the crap out of him but like   yeah\n\nYeah, yeah you were trying to say something before.\n\nWell but I think the private institution should decide how many rights they  I mean  cause I mean if you  if they don't   if the private institution says alright this is where we're gonna draw the line then if you're saying hey you cant do that  you're like alright you're paying to be here  if you don't like it then why are you paying to be here  go somewhere else  it's a private institution  I mean that's what I was trying to get at with that but um  yeah\n\nCars.\n\nThat's illegal search and procedure\n\nI love that thing  you ever see that thing like if a policeman ever comes to your door  like ask to see the warrants  like you do not have to speak to them  like\n\nLike be courteous\n\nYou can shoot them. I love to tell that story. This is a good invasion of privacy story  did you hear about the [inaudible] guy in Texas?  that got shot?  guy was in the shower and the [inaudible] guy came to take his truck  right?  and he was using the shower so he didn't hear the doorbell ring  so uh the [inaudible] guy's like oh I guess he's not home  so he goes to take his truck and he like  he doesn't break into his truck  I mean he opens the truck cause he's gonna take it away  and the guy gets out the shower  looks out the window and he sees some guy breaking into his truck  so he takes a towel and wraps it around his waist  just takes this double barrel shot gun  runs out and shoots em point blank in the head and kill him  he gets off scot-free cause  it's his house man  someone's stealing his car  it's the extreme but it's the invasion of privacy\n\nCause he was under the belief that the guy was stealing his uh\n\nIt's not  but I mean it's like it just goes to show how like loose the phrase invasion of privacy can be like  that's really the point I was trying to make with that  It was just a cool story\n\nPlease do not take this seriously, but I could say like I have an AK47 in my room  it's my private property like hopefully if any Loyola College police officer heard me say that they'd be like what's your ID number?  Where do you live?  and like run up to my room and search  cause that's like something  I guess it's just a personal thing  like I'd rather have less freedoms  I mean if you're law-abiding and you got nothing to hide  even if you're not law-abiding like wink, wink, nudge, nudge  and you got some stuff in your room you don't want them to see  if you're wise enough  you'll never get caught\n\nExactly, yeah  that's the point I'm making\n\nPlus, they make little safes that look like coca-cola cans.\n\nPeople should know that stuff though\n\nI'd get all over the Loyola police for that.\n\nPigs\n\nYeah. Myspace is stupid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        " And that's the only thing if we like let's say we had been debating about it and we had decided not to go look for them and then they use them\n\n We'd be like could you imagine if we went in? I feel like I feel like in that case it was important to go and look for them because if we had found them we woulda been like nice saved ourselves so we looked and around and we didn't have them they didn't have them which is kind of not you know I don't know I feel like it was important because we could have just turned our backs on it and then what could have happened?\n\n Yeah, they were probably dismantled, if anything.\n\n I feel like if they coulda done and I don't have any good examples but like if they coulda done I feel like they coulda helped them in another way I mean obviously getting rid of Saddam was like the biggest step ever and then maybe not implementing a democracy, but implementing some certain rights or giving them sort of government maybe is there like a more basic government system they could have tried to employ?\n\n I never thought about it like that.\n\n Yeah, I was gonna say didn't it become a revolutionary war? \n\n Also being the most powerful we see a country that's just so weak and then I mean obviously if we think about it we're like oh a country that's not doing so well, given them a democracy like it does seem like if you don't think any further than that like democracy works out well let's give them one of those like it does seem like a pretty good idea until you try and think of how you do it and I think I think that's why because they I mean it's been, what two years that we've been there?\n\n Three?\n\n Four? Great but I'm ya know but it just keeps I just feel like why they've still had to be there because they're realizing it didn't work out exactly how they planned\n\n And then we'd have to do it again.\n\n What he would do\n\n Yeah\n\n I mean even I have a friend who's on his second time over in Iraq now and he's over there now and they told him that he doesn't know when he's coming back and all those sorts of things and I mean as much as they're fighting and it's obviously what they believe in What is it anymore? Like what are they exactly fighting for? and obviously you're trying to fight for the best for that country but even what I don't even know if we know what we're doing anymore\n\n Like I don't I mean obviously I'm not when he gets home I'm not gonna bring up the war, but I don't even know if they would know exactly what they're fighting for in just in direct terms of that whereas do we know what we're fighting for anymore?\n\n Especially then when they didn't really have a choice.\n\n Right\n\n I mean, yeah, and that's why we've always in a lot of the past wars that you feel like people are successful because they're fighting for what they believe in they're fighting for what they love they're fighting for what they think is right. How are you fighting when you don't know what you're fighting for? When you don't really know what you're doing everyday by going out and waking up and risking your life\n\n It's not gonna make anymore sense now.\n\n I agree. It's easy for us to talk, but we don't actually\n\n Right\n\n Good luck with that.\n\n It's definitely an option. I never really thought about it in that respect.\n\n Right\n\n And it's also and it's also why we're hoping it becomes like obsolete by then you know with all like they're trying to get our cars to run on vegetable oil I mean and this is like you know getting ridiculous but I mean if not that a hundred years is a long time but if the end of it is in a hundred years hopefully we have another I mean they've only really started to do this I'm sure people have worked on it for a long time, but really a lot you've only heard about it in the last couple of years and we've made some you know some better\n\n I mean how big could they be making if they're gonna keep working on it you know?\n\n But even if it becomes something no, I mean I definitely think it'll become something that the government can make money on but, if it's something we're not gonna run out on in the next one hundred years I'm for it you know, if it's something that is gonna be an alternative to oil and we don't have anymore oil\n\n I mean that's a ridiculous amount of people.\n\n And I think that it's also a lot of people who I mean as we all agree we really couldn't come up with a main like reason for the war and I think that's a lot of it too is what makes it even worse because then you hear things like that you're like oh man and they send more people over there and we're not even doing anything but, if there was a clear goal in sight and these people were working towards something then I don't know if there'd be any objection I mean there would obviously be objection to having people over there, but not as much if you thought there was a clear goal in sight but that's what makes people more angry about it is that they're not even sure what they're fighting for much less why there's so many\n\n I mean, you'd think.\n \n He acts like we don't have a TV.\n \n I think what his motivation needs to be is looking at other problems like North Korea and things like that and kind of focusing on what could be in the future instead of going on I mean not to say that we didn't I mean the argument about if we had to be in Iraq or not like we were there we are there it's happened but now at this point in time the argument is like stay there or go and I mean we do have so many people there that even take some of them you know like move some of them and I mean I think we have to realize that there are bigger threats out there right now because Iraq is not a threat to us right now really like so much and that we need to realize that there are other threats to us\n \n I kind of agree leave it as a stand-still \n \n I think a lot of it is he's not worried about re-election he's not worried about I mean not to say this is not his main motivation but he's not worried about re-election he's not worried about anything like that so I think he's going I think he's gonna say that he's just doing it for the way that he can be like no, it's fine everything's ok I believe that I mean there has to be a part of him that believes that they're doing something cause he wouldn't just be leavin em there you're right you're not gonna leave all of your American soldiers over there for no reason and they're getting hurt everyday but, I think there's definitely so he has to believe it somehow but, I think a lot of it is there's not really a motivation for him to have to make a decision right now cause it's like you said I mean it's kind of like fifty-fifty because if he leaves them there, there's gonna be half the people that want them back, but if he takes them out then it could be something worse\n\n He woulda been exactly but if it was such a simple decision, it woulda been done\n\n He does. I mean he's gotta know something.\n\n What he should be doing so he's gotta be thinking that this is something he has to think that it's best to keep people there or he wouldn't be\n\n Right, he's not like let's ruin America like that's not why like I really can't see I mean sure people don't like him but I really don't think it's a conspiracy theory like him against the world\n\n And then it also becomes an issue of what do you do then if taking them out's not if taking them out's not the answer and leaving them there is making everything not so good then ok like what does that mean?\n\n There's gotta be a solution. I think that could also be part of it. He has to believe that there's some reason they're there but also it could be so even if he started to believe that we shouldn't be there, what should we do? what is he gonna do with them? gonna make a human wall around the country? like there's nothing to do with them like he can't win either way basically\n\n Right\n\n I think something needs to be done and I don't think now is the time, and I don't know what to be done is to be done so I don't know I mean that was just like not needed to be said actually but you know I don't know if there's anything something needs to be done, but we don't know what it is and they don't know what it is or I feel it woulda been done\n\n Focus on other things that we need to be worried about.\n\n Cause ultimately, they are the ones that know everything it's not us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        " Wait so your friends changed your mind about it?\n\n Well, I mean separation of church and state isn't actually in the Constitution\n\n Exactly, it wouldn't seem to harm the state to [inaudible]\n \n Yeah\n \n I can't believe they did that. So wait, what was your reaction to that?\n\n No they reacted they what they petitioned or?\n\n Really?\n \n The Midwest it's not like it's the first time that states have you know made laws that they ban certain types of marriages, you know I can I just wonder if it's not just you know twenty first century version of you know, banning interracial marriages and even that you know there is still plenty of racism in this country\n\n And, and so \n\n Yeah, and so I mean I agree with you you said you know you think there's still a lot of people in this country who really are not OK with it, and criticize it, and things like that, but I um in terms of I guess civil unions versus marriage I I think they should be able to get married I don't know what is it, Vermont is civil union and New Jersey is civil union\n\n Massachusetts is actual marriage I think.\n\n Yeah\n \n My aunt married um a black man and my grandparents after uh my grandfather retired they used to live in New York uh they moved to North Carolina and to a very rural area then my aunt her family won't go down there cause there's you know racism still exists and\n\n Homosexuality?\n\n I mean, I don't know if the church's policy has turned out all that well I mean can't help but think that the repression of homosexuality had something to do with you know the priests\n\n I mean, you I mean kids are brought up by so many different kinds of families now I mean by grandparents, single parents, or aunts, uncles whatever I mean at least and many kids grow up without a loving family or a good home or anything like that so I don't know why not you know then\n\n At least there's full proof for that.\n\n I don't think that's right to begin with.\n\n But, I mean I used to be I don't think that's right I mean I think that you could kinda compare that even to I mean that sounds to me like something the Nazis wanted to do\n\n I mean \n \n I mean wow \n\n Yeah\n\n Yeah\n\n I think that the government has bigger problems that they need to worry about.\n\n Yeah\n\n Throw it out there.\n\n I mean gay couples it isn't likely they have their own problems regardless of what I mean they should still at least be given the same chance heterosexual couples are given\n\n That's longer than most marriages.\n\n Got any more statistics?\n\n I can't help but think that sorry that an amendment banning gay marriage would do anything else but just enforce and encourage more people to discriminate against gays and be more hostile against them.\n\n And then you feel the only way you can have kids is if you do a conventional, heterosexual marriage and then you\n\n And the whole family\n\n New Jersey\n\n I'm from northern New Jersey like ten minutes from New York City.\n\n I mean it's\n\n I mean yeah that scares me the fact that you know people I've witnessed personally like racism with African Americans it all still scares me it doesn't like you said it doesn't go away it just keeps\n\n",

Put it out there to be seen.\n\n Same here\n\n Why?\n\n But, we can bring it into tapping phones it's the same kind of thing\n \n Umm I have had\n\n Yeah, but what about you never know\n\n Same thing with internet well you do the same thing with the phone companies but, it's still public you're putting it out there it's still public same thing with IM's like I don't talk on the phone so I've had more important conversations through Myspace, through things like messages on Facebook and email and IM's and personally I know that if I'm putting something onto the internet somebody's gonna see it it's also saved on my hard drive no matter how many times I try to wipe it and somebody that knows how to do it they can hack in and see anything, and they can do the same thing with the phones so how do you differentiate between what's public and what's not?\n\n Which is stupidity, but\n\n It's still public air waves, right?\n\n What about the phone tapping that happened after 9-11?\n\n School lines or personal ones? Not our cell phones, but the school owns our room phones.\n\n Ok, that's \n\n I never use my room phone, but I'm saying just in general they own them they have the right we give our rights away when we come here it's a private institution we give our rights away at the door. They can do anything they want. \n\n Same thing though mmm\n\n I wouldn't say home phones in high school\n\n Well, just in general, do you think the internet is public? I mean anything you put on the internet I it's not just email I mean it's not just emails Facebook, Myspace, Flicker whatever you want to say\n\n Xanga whatever it is it's all public Internet Explorer, MSN\n\n Somebody who has five minutes of a hacking course can access your IM's and your emails from your last you know four years um  so that's public, right?\n\n So, is it right that they get like ok maybe not the school shooting right? but, a girl from my high school got expelled for having a picture on her Myspace of her drinking\n\n I went to an all-girls, Catholic high school\n\n Mmhmm.\n\n It was a long situation because there was a group they did a Myspace group called the Villa Gorillas I went to we were the Villa Gorillas\n\n St. John Villa Academy High School for girls if you do track, you know us other than that, probably not cause we were the only sport that mattered\n\n All I have to say right now um no, but so there was a picture of the principal on the group and that's how they found her Myspace she did nothing on the school computer's, but there's pictures of her basically when she came what they said was when she came into Villa she was representing Villa, and what she was putting out in public was not what they was against what Villa was about and she was given a chance to take it down and she wouldn't because she said it's public and it's mine it's really not hers because she's putting it out there first but on another term from that, what about employers? Because employers now look at Myspace and Facebook they look at Facebook now\n\n But, I'm not saying school officials employers completely different situation\n\n Do they? That's what I'm saying.\n\n Really?\n\n Uh huh love sports\n\n Ok, same thing ok\n\n Dr. Moore?\n\n Dr. Moore is so cool sorry \n\n They have more things they should be worrying about first of all\n\n What she said?\n\n Well, they do searches for specific phrases and words they just do sweeps\n Um and I could see where that would come in\n\n I mean, if it's just something inflammatory like I hate Bush or I hate what's going on with our government or I hate what's going on with this war\n\n Every liberal house in America or not in every liberal house every college house um, but\n\n No, I lost you know how you're brain is just going and then shhh, that's what happened so it's not your fault um \n\n Cause there's the threat and then there's inflammatory.\n\n And it sounds like what that was wasn't a threat. To give you an example, I applied for a job um in the city uh last oh, for Christmas and my employer looked at my Myspace she put my name in to Google she Googled me and my Myspace came up now I have a picture I do um pole dancing for exercising cause I don't know if you've guys heard of it's ridiculous\n\n Like ridiculous exercise\n\n No, I yes, but it's not\n\n I'm wearing gym clothes.\n\n It's you have it's basically you're lifting your entire body weight with your arms I lost twenty pounds in a week and a half it's insane, and my muscles were ridiculous I just but, my employer saw the picture and she goes she wanted to ask me about it and first my first thought was oh shit what she ended up asking was where did I go to do it, but do they have that right to question you about what you put on there?\n\n Well, no I agree but like so it's the same thing did they have the right to expel her for having a picture of her with a bottle of beer she was in Mexico, so technically where she was she was legal but, she had the picture on there and she wasn't [inaudible]\n\n She got she still got expelled so\n\n Community and privacy are two different things though you know you can have community and have privacy\n\n I think well I don't agree with that\n\n I think more \n\n And I've seen you around campus before I haven't see you guys at least that I remember I remember her hair so\n\n Sorry, I love red hair so it's not you I'm jealous of you so that's all\n Well, it is you, but it's not you. But, what I'm thinking is what's more important, safety or privacy?  I mean big brother's watching in our day and age I don't think he really is\n\n Well, what about when it comes to let's completely don't think about school what's more important your safety or your privacy? Should the government be able to look into what you have like technically if the can look at your Myspace and technically the government has enough talent people that can hack your computer like that if they see one thing on your Myspace that tweaks their interest or a blog or on something they can hack\n\n Your computer's not private. So, I'm saying if they see one phrase that makes them think hmm, I wonder they can technically they have the power \n\n I'm talking about your computer you put one thing on the internet and that tweaks their interest they can without talking to you technically, it's illegal, but they can do it anyway and we all know that not everything that happens with the government is completely legal um they can hack your computer like that they can look at all your files anything\n\n Technically, they would have to have it, but they wouldn't have to talk to you for them to get them for it the could get it without speaking to you and you wouldn't even know it\n\n They have to be present. Someone has to be present. When it comes to this, you don't even have to know because they can go into your computer and not even leave a trace.\n\n Personally, I'm one for when it comes to certain things when it comes to unless there's an army knocking down my door let me deal with my own safety just give me my privacy that's my view I want my privacy, I'm a very when it comes to things that I want to keep to myself, I keep them to myself I mean obviously I'm very opinionated and I speak my mind, but there are things that I keep to myself that I wouldn't want anybody to know and I personally write on my computer I write better on my computer my ideas flow better I have a journal on my computer I have things that I would never want anybody else to read so, who gives anybody that right to come onto my computer? You know? Cause to me that's a breach of privacy that's as bad as somebody searching my house. \n\n Do you all just see what I'm saying though in that I'd rather deal with my own safety.\n\n I'd rather have my own privacy. Which, a lot of people think that I'm crazy, and that I really don't understand what I'm saying, but \n\n I think I agree with you. When it comes to things that I literally when it's on the internet, it's public information, but if it's on if it's not on the internet they you're computer can be connected to the internet, but it's on your computer it's not been put out there for others to see that's private there's a block there\n\n So\n\n When I think privacy issues, I think the phone tap after 9-11 that's my automatic thought I don't think about the internet because that's public information, but do if there's even an iota of suspicion, should they be able to tap our phones?\n \n But who decides that?\n\n Who decides but, that's the problem the problem is it's too objective who decides? like who decides who we tap who decides what's a legitimate reason?\n\n There's no real standards is what I'm saying.\n\n There still isn't really a standard for when it comes to search warrants it's up to the judge\n\n So is that is that a good system or should it be fixed? like personally I think there's a problem with it that it needs to be fixed there needs to be a standard because somebody can one judge can say you can search this house because you heard him say that he hates Bush and then another judge can say, well just because you heard him say that he has a cache of guns you can't search his house because it's not a real reason like it's all obj- it's subjective\n\n Well we have standardized testing everybody's so different like this is a totally different situation, but in general it's the whole individual versus standardized thing you can't really you have to have a standard you have to have\n\n Oh, I know I know I'm just\n\n I'm just giving an example to show like the whole difference, like there is a standard there has to be a cut-off point where yes, a search warrant is automatically needed no matter who judges if this person was overheard or this person was seen with something that like when it comes to there has to  be a cut-off point\n\n Oh, I agree.\n\n I'm not saying its right, I'm just kid of playing the devil's advocate here. Um, to get things rolling um I don't know\n\n Oh, dear me.\n\n Well, here's the difference, when you go to a school that's a private institution you're you check your rights at the door, but when you come into this country, you don't  when you come into this country, you get your rights so do they have the same rights as a school does?\n\n Public and private they're still \n\n Well, yeah it's the same thing because like the locker it's all public property at the school the school at catholic school you check your rights at the door when you go to that school because they're admitting you you have to go by their rules that's why their allowed to punish you detention, etcetera, etcetera\n Oh no, I agree with you.\n\n I think, when it comes to schools, you have no rights because you checked your rights at the door you've given them you've given yourself over to them what I'm saying is you don't do that when you come into our country\n\n You don't give up your rights, so how does that\n\n Government like it's kind of a paradox\n\n To take away your rights\n\n It's all kind of intertwined kind of mushed all together you can't really separate it it's all you know I don't know I'm kind of like losing articulation\n \n I've been up since six don't know why I went for a run before my eight a.m. class that was stupid\n\n I don't think there is really a line cause when it comes to that it's you give up your rights when you come to school you have to obey by their rules and, you know a school shooting is definitely outside the rules\n\n Talking in school public space you know if he was if the kid was overheard or I don't know honestly do we even know if the Myspace if the school officials found it or if he was reported by somebody else? We don't know and you know informants it's also an invasion of privacy, but those are your friends so\n\n Well, here's the other problem you can't look at bulletins unless you're somebody's friend you don't see their bulletins do you guys have Myspace?\n\n You do?\n\n You do? Right you have to be somebody's friend you don't get bulletins from them unless you're a friend you don't just see it on their profile so it either had to be a blog post or somebody turned them in so really there's no question of privacy because they told somebody that they told their friends, and their friends turned them in there's really no question of privacy because the school officials really didn't have anything to do with it there because also the blogs you have to be friends most of the time to read them\n\n You can, but not with the bulletins.\n\n And, if it was a bulletin, which is what she said only the people on your friend's list can see it so kinda takes the whole I mean there's difference between like you can write a Facebook and, but then again there's the security on Facebook like only people that can see my page are my friends if you're not my friend no matter if you're in my network or not, you can't even search for me my friend Tess did it last night she went to high school with me, so we're both you know in the same network and she searched for me, and some girl in another state came up and the only Valerie Hart in the U.S. and she's like well you exist, and you're on Facebook but she even looked through our mutual friends who I'm friends with on Facebook list and I'm not on there so you can tweak your security settings so people can't find you\n\n So, where does the privacy end? because you can put layers and layers and layers and layers on\n\n Personally, I have it for one reason one reason only to keep people from to find classmates if I need to\n\n Oh, absolutely.\n\n Last year or the year before?\n\n Ok yeah that's the first year it came out\n\n It's also completely different now than it was then because\n\n And completely different than it was last year or you guys freshman or?\n\n Freshman, or you a freshman?\n\n See, I'm a sophomore. Last year was completely different you couldn't be on Facebook unless you were in college, and then high school was over the summer\n\n And then now it's open to everybody\n\n And, it's it was a lot safer I think it was a lot safer before\n\n Now it's like Myspace.\n\n And honestly, the only reason I have Myspace is because my cousins in Germany don't have Facebook.\n\n I'm assuming I think so yeah\n\n And then change\n\n But you've never met them\n\n Which is scary\n\n I mean honestly I think I don't know anybody I know everybody and I know everybody on Facebook who's on my friends list I don't know you you aren't on my friends list because\n\n No, the scary part was I um I got messaged from this guy who I hadn't seen in eight years I got friended, and I was like whoa somebody can find me that easy that scares me like I'm not even listed in the phonebook cause I'm like I don't like if I don't want you to find me if I want you to find me, I'll give you my number that scared me I don't like to be found that easy it's just like creepy almost because it completely changed our culture the internet in general completely changed our culture, but I mean how many people now talk on the phone every night? like it used to be you gab on the phone to your girlfriends or your guy friends or not really guy friends\n\n But like like you know what I'm saying? In high school, we called our friends not me because I got home at midnight, but track but, you know you don't do that anymore now you just turn on a computer and you talk to eight different people at one time\n\n I think my record was no I think my record was twenty boxes open at once because I was doing three different group projects and then I was talking to my cousins, and my brother, and my Mom have you ever instant messaged with your parents because it's frickin hysterical\n\n It's funny my Mom writes like whole paragraphs \n\n I mean it's a generational thing that we're worried about privacy so much because did our parents have to worry about it? I mean our Mom's had to be worried about their diary being read by others we have to worry about our diary being read by the entire world just a thought\n\n\n\n",
        "Wow\n\n22nd \n\nI think like after September 11th we had to do like something but we went into Afghanistan and I think that would have been strange and on like the part of the nation if we just let ourselves be attacked without trying to at least do something to find like Osama Bin Laden but then the war in Iraq is like a completely different like thing so \n\nthen like what you were just saying about how like ya know thinking that there were like the um weapons of mass destruction and like it was kind of like I feel like Bush used the fact that we were like already at war to then kind of transition into a different war when really it was not necessary\n\nYea\n\nI thought they executed him didn't they? \n\noh no never mind I lied forget that sorry \n\nI think we're just like in a huge mess right now cause if we pull out now then we're just gonna like leave the place worse than when we went into it because they have they're just learning about governmental systems and like everything's new to them and if we pull out now it would kinda be like Russia pulling out Afghanistan and leaving like ruins but we need to get out I mean it's stupid that we're there still and sending people and more people over and I just feel like working on an exit strategy I don't feel like they're working on an exit strategy.\n\nyea I agree \n\nI just don't think either one of them were good.\n\nI think we need new people\n\nEveryone's fresh right in this new election for the most part?\n \nYea\n\nand you would think that if like I totally blanked out on the name but the national the United Nations\n\nwhoa that took too long um you would think if like none of them are supporting us that be kind of a key like maybe it's not such a good idea \n\nlike we need to just finally actually start cleaning up after ourselves and doing it really really slowly and giving them like more power themselves a little bit at a time and like I know that's like what he says he's doing but I don't feel like he's doing that right now\n\nThis is going back to the whole Busy or Kerry thing um I read this article it wasn't an article I think it was a transcription of some sort of like a message that um Osama Bin Laden broadcast over Al-Jazeer maybe like during the presidential elections I'm not a hundred percent sure but it was really interesting it was about how even though Bush would be like not that Kerry's ideas would coincide at all with like the um Islamic fundamentalist ideas but more so than like the conservatives but like actually in terms of the election that Al-Qaeda  would probably rather have had Bush reelected because the whole like point what they want with the terrorism and everything is for like our us as a nation to just like fail and to get into debt and to like they just want to see us not succeed um and like Bush is helping us not do that so I don't know when I was reading that that was like it was interesting cause I would have thought they would prefer Kerry but it's really not that they're trying to reach any agreement with us that they just want to see us fail \n\nyea it was interesting to see on the news there was something maybe a couple of months ago when Bush announced that he was going to be sending over like 20,000 more troops they had in a room it was like split up evenly of people that supported the war in Iraq and people who didn't and they had some sort of a little meter that they were rating like as they were listening to what he was saying like if they agree with it if they didn't agree with it and like for the most part whatever he was talking about it was like kinda split you could see obviously like the people who supported and the people who were against it it was different but then as soon as he mentioned that um he was gonna be sending over more troops like both sides like went way down and like yea I just figure that we've come to the point where hardly anyone supports it and like what does that say about a nation where no one like or the President is doing what is like opposite of what he majority of the people are saying and it's supposed to be democracy \n\nI just don't feel like any of them could have done it I just don't really feel like either of them are capable of the job \n\nWe were already involved.\n\nYea I think if what we're all agreeing on is that most people are not in support of it but I think that at the time of the election it wasn't quite as clear cut as that and also I think I mean just what I've heard some people say um that ya know he got us into this mess he needs to be the one to get us out or like he needs to finish what he started like I heard that from some people \n\nthat's true \n\nOh my G-d \n\nThat's really sad.\n\nI mean I definitely think it's gone on long enough but at the same time I mean like you said before you're not a general you don't know what we should do I don't know what we should do either about like how to end it because we can't just like pick everything up and leave like they're it's like too chaotic but then at the same time we I don't think we should be sending more troops over there because we need to be like slowly like backing off so they can start to do more themselves it's I think it's just a big mess I don't know what else to say about what we should be doing\n\nwe need to like educate people on exit strategies and then have them go into a room and decide on the best thing cause \n\nI feel like that's probably what he's gonna do\n\nI don't see it ending before the election\n\nNo. \n\nThat would leave everything in shambles. \n\nThat would make other countries hate us even more like say the people who \n\nI know but we don't need to add like worse to it \n\nwell I mean like that would not help our nation we would make more enemies by just yanking ourselves out of there then like all the enemies we have on top of \n\nyea and like then that leaves that country so susceptible to everything and just taking more like terrorists would like take over the country and like it would not be good for anyone \n\nBut I mean ok think of it this way if you're living there and like basically you're whole governmental system is gone you basically have no soldiers and this other country is like /taking over you and then they all of a sudden just like leave you have nothing aren't you going to be a little mad that they're not fixing what they started and the next person who comes in is like let's go check blah blah blah cause they created this huge mess you're gonna be like let's do this that would not be a good situation if we just left. \n\nYea we need to just slowly back out and have them gain the power as a country themselves so they can govern themselves \n\nWe've already lost them\n\nI don't know I don't think we have many allies and like I agree with you in like the allies sense we've made a ton of enemies but we just need to let Afghanistan work for themselves is what I'm trying to say well I mean that's not what I'm saying sorry wrong country \n\nWhoa anyways so yea Iraq we need to have Iraq work for themselves and be able to govern themselves without us being there \n\n\n",
        "Well, I mean what do you want me to say? Gender discrimination? Of course there’s always gonna be gender discrimination.\n\nEvery yeah exactly every discrimination is gonna be prevalent, but we can get to that later but we’ll see what your thoughts on that are\n\nYou concur with me or\n\nThe south may rise again.\n\nThe thing is there’s two main points in this I mean \n\nWhat are you laughing at?\n\nWell, no I mean there’s like a point where we can look back I mean it’s foolish to say we haven’t come a long way with gender discrimination I mean at this point like it’s not like you can’t get this job you’re a woman it’s like get back in the kitchen and if I say something like that it’d understood to be a joke and like I was in before the discussion started the family guy jokes and they like parody it but to a certain extent when you parody something you’re prolonging it and I mean you can never you can never completely forget what’s been done before so like as long as it’s up there you might as well parody it and I mean you just have to be intelligent about it and you have to know that not to take it seriously there’s another point I was gonna make also there are some truth to every stereotype and don’t tell me \n\nI mean, number Miss 17 you first-hand know that in the sciences and in mathematics who is like \n\nI mean, number Miss 17 you first-hand know that in the sciences and in mathematics who is like \n\nYeah, I know. It’s not that they’re worse at it it’s just like it just like arbitrary statistics that not as many women are\n\nAnd you can misread that in anyway you want and anyway besides just looking at it as an arbitrary statistic is misreading it, but it’s I mean it’s\n\nProbably coming from back in the day when women\n\nYeah, exactly it’s just like I don’t know Greg Mendel uh genetics it’s not just physical stereotypes \n\nExactly like yeah\n\nAn administrative assistant\n\nOhh you can’t say that, man ask any\n\nFemale ROTC any guy on campus will just shudder it’s a shame but any guy\n\nNo, that’s an occupation\n\nNo, I’m thinking like without no face in your mind right you’re not thinking of anyone right now ok? if I said girl that’s in ROTC just like running through like the list of people in your mind like how many I hate to say it but how many\n\nExactly cause there is you are not like a what is it? a misogynist? yeah  like you’re you don’t like treat women badly there’s there’s truth to everything because you have to look at like logically there are some statistics and I mean something like whether you find a woman aesthetically pleasing to the eye is kind of\n\nWow\n\nNo I’m not sayin but I mean I don’t want to get too off topic on here, but I’ll just drop this little bomb as like \n\nHey  I’m not talking about like yeah there’s some very beautiful athletic women out there but um I’m talking about some of these girls I mean um I wonder if like their Dad hit them in the face with a frying pan like\n\nThat that was a low blow but see I’m making a parody of it I mean it all comes back\n\nNo, I have some very, very ugly friends man like but like it’s not like you got you gotta take everything in stride you gotta take everything with a grain of salt\n\nActually, if you flip that think about the male nurse the murse\n\nYeah yeah\n\nYeah\n\nYeah, exactly stay at home Dads\n\nNo, gymnastics is crazy, man.\n\nBut, I get what you’re saying and yeah but like the WNBA it’s like yeah good for them they’re doin basketball yeah but if like a guy\n\nWell, that depends\n\nExactly\n\nI think the biggest like\n\nYeah?\n\nThank God. \n\nIf you lose, man\n\nWoah\n\nSure\n\nOh I’ve seen that issue of sports illustrates and the whole thing is that what you’re talking about?\n\nNo a couple years back there was I don’t read [laughter] I don’t read um uhh that’s awful I’m sorry but there was  an issue of Sports Illustrated a while back that actually featured the same exact story I thought that’s what you were referring to it was like \n\nThis was like when we were in middle school it was like years ago but um yeah it was like this guy’s wearing a skirt? [laughter] cause it was part of the uniform like he wanted to play field hockey ya know it was just like the girls\n\nYes, yes exactly it was the whole thing and he would well like no it’s like some skirt, right? correct me if I’m wrong for field hockey? and so like at the on the days of the match everyone wore their uh their skirts and this dude was walkin around with like a skirt\n\nYeah as part of the team so he’s wearing like this skirt around school and I mean at first everyone I bet ya he had to knock a couple heads in before they like let him wear it quietly but\n\nNaw, man. The kid like persevered that’s why it got into Sports Illustrated\n\nDid he like break under the pressure? No\n\nYeah yeah that was the point like he just he didn’t care and like the voice in the crowd or whatever\n\nI ya know what? I don’t even now it was just that he wanted to play field hockey\n\nIt was the exception yeah\n\nNo\n\nYeah, cause there was guys on the girls swimming team.\nYeah\n\nOh that’s a good point cause guys watch the girls change gender stereotype right there right there male full frontal is an automatic NC-17 in a movie\n\nYup.\n\nYeah, it’s the ugly organ.\n\nBut um no but like you can get brief full frontal\n\nUh Airplane Airplane did anyone see Airplane with \n\nOh, it wasn’t G. I had to been at least PG. It was either PG or PG-13, but I’m pretty sure Airplane was PG-13.\n\nYeah Airplane with Leslie Neilson, right? Isn’t that his name?\n\nYeah not it couldn’t have been G but anyways it wasn’t it definitely wasn’t R and they have a scene parodying like when the plane’s goin down and everyone’s running around and they show a completely naked woman screaming, running across the like it’s a very funny scene \n\nYeah and like exactly constantly\n\nNo no like it’s a funny yeah like things like that stick out because it’s nudity but um yeah if you show like a naked guy running around it’d be like ahh oh my word\n\nDid it show was it brief?\n\nOh wow\n\nThe woman’s body is a beautiful thing.\n\nYeah it’s like one of the most prominent \n\nMichelangelo’s\n\nYeah, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles but also it’s just like there’s also the stereotype of guys being more perverted than girls\n\nI mean it isn’t even a problem in Europe.\n\nYeah, and it’s just like no big deal.\t\n\nBut see like what do you think like I don’t know does that put us at a disadvantage as far as gender discrimination goes?\n\nWell, that’s just nudity that’s not even like gender discrimination\n\nYeah\n\nYeah\n\nI want to be portrayed as a sex symbol. I like when people look at me, Daddy.\n\nI don’t know like just like you get\n\nLike I just may be a tard\n\nLike Mr. Twenty over here and his poor pinched butt.\t\n\nWho do you think has a better shot?\n\nBarrack Obama or Hilary Clinton?\n\nHilary Clinton\n\nObama\n\nPresident elect he’s half African American\n\nOh, ok. So African American male or a white female?\n\nDo you think racial discrimination is more strong than gender?\n\nHe’s a man though.\n\nNo, actually he doesn’t not at all\n\nUm you should look into that it’s a really big like\n\nYeah but uh yeah I mean like I don’t know cause different countries in the world view it as like well they have a man and like it doesn’t matter different countries in the world are like different races but like if a woman the United States is run by a woman? I mean like how would that look to other countries? God, forbid I mean like\n\nI’ve never seen enough of the show to\n\nThe homely looking one\n\nLarger?\nI love these yeah\n\nP.C. word\n\nDo you do you think that actually has says anything negative or positive or anything?\n\nAnd the one person who doesn’t have a man is an alcoholic\n\nOK\n\nThat’s a good even from what just you said OK that makes a good point\n\nWhat were you saying before? Who was saying stuff\n\nYeah, different stereotypes\n\nIt’ll come\n\nWithout looking at their personalities\t\n\nJust if someone said, hey black male or white chick?\n\nBut, I think if you look from a if people are looking from like a global standpoint I think just a woman\n\nIt also hasn’t been as extreme.\n\nI mean we didn’t enslave any slave women.\n\nIt’s just a more moderate thing overall.\n\nAfrican American woman that’s a double whammy\n\nBack in the day we used to know her as number nineteen.\n\nRun it out. How we doin on the clock?\n\n",
        "uh  I don't think it's as big of a problem as it was in the past. Um  I do feel that it's unfair that females get paid less salary than males do for many of the jobs  even if they're the same jobs  and  there's also sometimes defective like  big glass ceiling  where like women can only like rise so far in the work field  and then  they can't get passed that because people don't look at them as  I guess  as certified even though they might even have more credentials than males are  those are probably the two main issues I have \n\nI guess I kind of agree with what you're saying like  a lot of the times  I guess not even just with women  but it's like for anyone  it's always the connections that you know  and I guess I'm kinda turning this politically  but  I would like to see it more clean  where you can just like  rise up to the top of it  without any ties  but that's kind of off topic  sorry\n\nI agree with that  like  cause there's like  Queen Elizabeth  and then of past and now there's like Queen Elizabeth now  and  everyone like  holds her in such high esteem  that  I don't think  like  Europe as a whole would have a problem with a woman president  I think they'd probably actually think it was  very refreshing since we've had such a long trend of only males  and only white  and only upper class  and  um  I don't know. I just  and in the Middle East  what you were saying  that's like a whole different culture  so  you can't really compare different cultures in that regard  but  I guess they could like accept our choice and we could accept theirs  even if we don't agree  and \n\nUm  well  I wouldn't think that that would be very empowering  but  again  I mean  I'm not from that culture  but  I don't know that you could really generalize and say that like all the women feel that that's empowering \n\nYea  Yea\n\nIt would be interesting to see like  in a few years  because of  the  new trend in colleges  with more females graduating  [inaudible] the workforce  \n\nUm  one thing with that  like  you could think that if  as long as there's some sort of a discrimination that exists  it  it might even almost make more sense for that top person to be male because if there's going to be like males below  like if that top person was a female and then the males below her would be resentful of that fact that like  it might almost just be easier for the company to just  put a male up there  that way  I don't know  like I just know  like I have  one of my friends  her dad  her dad's boss is female and like  anytime I'm over there like he's always talking about that  like how he hates that  and so  if that puts like an upset in the company then  I don't know\n\nReally? \n\nYea  and I don't either  and like  there's definite reasons why there haven't been like female drafts  and  I  I don't know  I mean  as much as I like don't like the fact that there's some things that women can't do  I mean \n\nYea  It is discrimination but like we can also be taken advantage of a lot easier  like if there was a draft and say you were like captured  I don't know  that's like going to the extreme \n\nbut I'm just saying  I don't know  like with the firefighters and everything  like  not everybody has the strength to like hold  like equipment and stuff  there's like a reason there's more males in certain jobs\n\nI think the closest form about equality would be  um  like you said earlier  um  allowing people to make the choice  female or male  if you want to work in a certain job or not  and then having other people accept your choice  I think that's like the closest form of equality  that we can get to\n\nMolesters or something\n\nThat's a good point though.  I mean like  just because it's like not something you see everyday  you're just like  you automatically think  oh what's like behind the surface?\n\nI guess going back to  um  the [inaudible] female to male  male to female  um  \n\num  some  science lesson of the day  some people are like born without like a specific gender and  um  they used to be that they'd just make them all females cause that was like the easier operation to perform but now they're realizing that  beyond like the physical appearance  it's the chemicals within the body and like brain that like make you  feel more one way or the other  and so they're waiting 'til they hit puberty to see which one they feel more like and then do the operation to like  conform them to whatever it is they feel  because  we were learning in science class back in the day that a lot of people who are turned into females per say did not feel like that they were and they weren't happy  so \n\nYou just kinda keep them in like  not really \n\nI don't know.\n\nWhen they turn like twelve is like when they do it  and so \n\n I don't know  it's just what they're thinking of doing because there've been a lot of mistakes in the past [inaudible]  I don't know  probably maybe not 'til twelve  maybe it'll be like when they're eight\n\nit was back in the day when I learned this  but it was interesting \nRight\n\nThis is true\n",

        "Hi, I'm number eighteen.\n\nYeah um I really don't know cause I'm a catholic too and of course with marriage being between a man and a women it kinda gets a little sticky when you're talking about the church as opposed to the government but um yeah I don't really know what the terminology could be changed maybe to make everyone happy but then again it wouldn't make everyone happy if we're throwing around vocabulary and like history of a word but um the concept I'm not against definitely not.\n\nCause I think that they have certain ideals that they're pushing for\n\nI always thought something funny was um people look at marriage as a religious definition but it's kinda funny if you think about it the government doesn't give like tax breaks or anything to people who are baptized. You don't get baptized in the face of like the U.S. government so maybe like if you wanted to go like to the wall with the separation of church and state you could just call it all legal unions and then I don't know but that's maybe goin a little too far\n\nNo that's what I mean so if you just take that legal definition and kinda take away the marriage hot word marriage and put so the government just views it all as legal cause you everyone\n\nMmm. \n\nYeah cause their still\n\nYeah so you're saying like the two different definitions of marriage like using the same word for two different things?\n\nYou could call it whatever you want.\n\nNot in the near future that's for sure that's for damn sure.\n\nOh it's not gonna I mean I like catholic but I have no doubt that like gay marriage is like not even gonna be considered an issue in the catholic church it's just not gonna happen for a while well yeah who knows for a while but I yeah growin up catholic and knowin how it works I definitely don't think\n\nWhat?\n\nI don't have a problem with it, but then again I'm not gay. So I don't know how like I don't know it's never it's not like a burning rage of like desire of mine to like go like \n\nYeah like go to the catholic church and appeal\n\nWell yeah I mean like I know gay people but I mean gay boys and girls\nUm no\n\nActually they're atheist so I guess they're kinda removed completely from the religious debate whatsoever\n\nPracticing Catholics?\n\nFor all the all the I hate to sound like I don't know judgmental but like for every one person that hops board that kinda movement there's gonna be like five dudes in like the deep south yellin from their porches that ain't right Ya know it's just so embedded in the culture I mean it's you're gonna have to wean it out after many generations after something like that gets introduced into the catholic church\n\nYes, tell us about the Baptist faith.\n\nPot-smokin tree huggers!\n\nI'm from Connecticut.\n\nThe whole spectrum of Loyola at least.\n\nI don't know. I don't think everything is politics. I disagree on that.\n\nIt's kinda funny cause I don't consider myself I don't really bother with parties like I'm just moderate like I worked for a congresswoman and I still don't consider myself a Republican. Actually, I'm glad she lost. Like yeah I don't know and workin on, workin on working on that was a big thing for me cause it's just like damn politics suck. Like it's just a shame how like I don't know it's like growing up high school politics like to the nth degree I mean it's pathetic I mean yeah the way some things in politics are run it's just getting that inside look feel like writing like a muckraker novel about like how awful the inside of politics is\n\nNice uh transition there tryin to uh keep us in the fences\n\nWell I don't know I wouldn't call states part of a party as a whole but I know you mean red and blue states but I mean I don't know\n\nYeah but the constitutional amendment that's just like it's just not logical I mean\n\nYeah I mean like if you let the states make their own laws and eventually all the states agree like why not why not make it a federal law but right now the way it is I mean like let them talk amongst themselves for a couple years.\n\nWhat, what, what do you think is gonna provoke all this? Just letting the states duke it out or like?\n\nSo you would legalize it for everyone?\nYeah, even if they don't do anything about it then they're allowing it.\n\nSo you're saying actually you're for the legalization of gay marriage, technically? From what you just said.\n\nPlayin off you and getting back to the constitutional part I think it'd be much easier to change a word in the dictionary then it'd be to change the constitution. Especially with good old Bush.\n\nWell the states are deciding it now and it's not like you have bombs in the streets now.\n\nThrough the window\n\nYeah I was gonna say you're just waiting for like that fuse to be lit\n\nKeep goin? Keep goin, ok.\n\nYeah. We've defined marriage. Let's define what it is to be gay.\n\nOoo ok\n\nI don't know the gay people I know are way to extreme it's just like F Bush I don't care like end of discussion\n\nYeah one of them yeah\n\nWell let's not throw all our eggs in one basket as far as the catholic church's views on uh\n\nHe's a nice guy, but he's against abortion.\n\nIt's not like yeah it's not like people are walkin down the street like havin it out\n\nNoo.\n",
        "I don't um I don't know if I agree with that I don't know if they stick with the Bible but more with like the laws of like the counsel of [inaudible] \n\nand like things from way back when but just to clarify something that you said were you trying to say like that you you don't really think it should change because the Catholic Church is the one thing that has been constant like they've kept their their laws so you'd think that you'd want different rules and stuff something that's not quite so outdated you should just go to a different church is that what you were kinda saying?\n\nbut isn't that like true of any literary work \n\nthat you can just interpret it however\n\nI guess that's why there are different religions and sects of religions because not everyone is obviously going to agree on everything and I know I have some friends back home that are like Baptist and there are so many different branches of Baptists and some of them take every single word in the bible literal like I had this one teacher and she swore the fish drowned from like the flood none of the rest of us who were in her class could understand how do fish drown and we just didn't see eye to eye on that one\n\nand so then like I guess it's like there's different religions thoughts whatever for every person and you just you either don't choose to be a part of it because you don't want to or you which is fine or you find one that you like which is also fine and like I guess one thing I like about the Catholic Church is that if you don't agree with them they're not gonna oh you're going to hell they're just like ok that's fine we'll accept your opinion which a lot of times people don't realize and I but I like how they're modern in that sense and they've kinda always been that way from what I've heard actually\n\nI don't really know either like I'm gonna be like the first one to say I definitely don't agree everything the pope says and maybe that makes me less of a Catholic but I don't know from everything I've heard from teachers I've had and the past like it's if if you have different feelings or different thoughts it's always been accepted I like I know my dad went to a Catholic school I've never been to Catholic school I guess Loyola kinda is and he said like always the nuns were always like telling him you should always accept other people's religions and other people's thoughts and respect them for what they have and what they believe in even though it's different and like I don't know maybe like the pope in a way I kinda feel like he shouldn't be the ultimate say in like everything like this is what I think this is what should happen I don't agree with everything that goes on there because like you said like some of the laws he's trying to get passed like I don't really know does do other people have to accept and like vote and agree with him\n\nmedium like\n\nkinda don't go together\n\nyea um I don't know I agree with that it also it really has to deal with like who's in charge at that particular time and I like it how it's not gonna stay the same always like whoever else is elected they could be like oh well I don't think this person got right so like we can tweak it so I guess it's modern in a sense that way kinda like presidents nowadays right? You get a new president every so many terms and some things not working you just like tweak \n\nbut what you're saying this is like a while back when you were talking about um like like the priests and people coming between an individual person and their relationship with G-d but like isn't that the whole point of organized religion I mean different people put it or want that to play a different role in their life so some people are perfectly fine to just have their own personal relationship with like a G-d or higher being or something um and not have any religion but religion if you choose to follow a certain religion that has it's own ideas and regulations and everything it's kind of more like you choose the one that best helps you to get that relationship with G-d\n\nOk\n\nthat's fine I'm not gonna like make you join a religion\n\nok \n\nIt's like your own fault.\n\nand also a lot of people I think use it to their excuse\n\nyea they're like oh well my religion doesn't allow me to do this so I'm just gonna say that but it's a total excuse for like everything I don't know\n\nyea an excuse to not have a real opinion like oh well someone once said this ok that's what I'll just say \n\nBut in the south like the bible-belt like of Baptists and everything\n\nif you take away all of like the specific rules of the Catholic Church or of any church is general you can still be left with basic morals that govern people's lives regardless of like specific things\n\noh you shouldn't have anything to eat before like an hour before communion like that's totally a manmade law that changed and those are the kinds of things\n\nI'm kind of just think are ridiculous\n\nthey were not made my G-d they were made by people in some council however many years ago so but if you if you look at just the basic morals that govern peoples lives those could be what are deciding whether ya know they what sort of things they believe politically as well so you not necessarily just the Catholic Church\nwell I think priests should be allowed to marry like I think a lot of people well I think that religious vocations like the Catholic Church is definitely losing people who are interested in becoming priests this might be like really random but I know that you see this in like old movies or old books or something where the dad would be like oh if you're bad I'm gonna send you to the convent and stuff like that so some people might not have chosen to become nuns and they were kind of like forced into it which might be why a lot of nuns are really grumpy\n\nUm I think that also with homosexuality being more like it's more acceptable like you can say that you're gay whereas I don't know say fifty years ago you if you weren't going to get married because you were gay people would be like why are you not married?  Like it was more basically common that you were either supposed to get married or become a priest like it was it would be strange so I think that people went into it maybe for the wrong reasons and if somebody really felt strongly that they wanted to be a priest but also wanted to have a family I think that it would be a good move for the Catholic Church also and the priest would be able to relate more to the congregation if they actually have families and I don't know I think it would be a good move\n\nYea it's very similar \n\nno I agree I think we should marry be able I think there are some changes that could happen.\n\nAnd also that was like\n\nYea and also it happened like pre there were popes and priests that were married way back when and then all this corruption started happening like they paid more attention to their families they like didn't really do anything much with their priesthood and that's when they made the law they're like oh well you're kinda neglecting your job and your duties so from now on you can't get married and devote yourself to G-D\n\nSorry\n\num well \n\nare you sure? um this might be like too random but um with all the stuff like the DiVinci Code and all that stuff that you don't know if it's true or not but the fact that Jesus might have been married I think that then that kind of could possibly like take away the reasoning that if it turns out Jesus really was married then like now why can't priests get married so \n\nI guess that's going back to what you said before at least what I was taking from what you said before about if if instead of trying to change the Catholic Church if you believe something different then you should just join a different religion and maybe that's what you were saying about like Lutheran\n\nSo I don't know it's I guess that's I keep bringing that up because that's something that I didn't really think about that I guess I'm trying to think like that some of the things are just too outdated and should be changed but I guess somewhere you could find a religion that has changed those things because that's how the um Lutheranism came about because Martin Luther like nailed those things on the door \n\nagain yea  \n\nYea\n\n",
        "I feel like it needs to change because society has changed so much and I'm just gonna use the case of um women priests as an example if women are getting certain rights in society like in the workforce and in everyday life that they didn't have like 100 years ago and then in the Catholic Church they go to church and their status is exactly the same as it was 1000 years ago\n\nThen I mean what does that say?\n\nReally?\n\nOh\n\nOh\n\nYea\n\nIt's just flawed interpretation \n\nYea  \n\nThere's like a whole other bible \n\nYea\n\nAnd most of them are the same\n\nIt's true.\n\nYea any church um\n\nYea I heard that \n\nYea\n\nThat's pretty arbitrary\n\nI think it's funny that like last year or whatever he gave um a special exemption cause a Friday in lent happened to be St. Patrick's Day\n\nSo everyone could eat their corned beef  \n\nIf it meant that much just have it on Saturday yea \n\nUh-huh completely it's just used for whatever it's needed for \n\nYea\nWell that's true the good thing and the bad thing about the church is that it's so so based and absorbed in tradition I mean that's where that's where the church comes from that's where all the morals come from that's where the rights come from and that's good but that's also where the obstinate picky little laws come from and and the practices that have been handed down over the centuries and gained and gained and lost their meaning the farther they get from their origin\n\nYea \n\nSeriously \n\nYea\n\nOh absolutely \n\nWhen G-d told us we needed to fight those Muslims we were all over that \n\nOh yea\n\nWhat's that? \n\nYea\n\nIt had to come from somewhere\n\nYea\n\nI think it's funny that we talk about separation of church and state and how the government shouldn't be involved in religious matters\n\nAnd how sorry um like it shouldn't be using religious arguments but throughout history like the church has been so so overly involved in politics\n\nSo I mean from both directions\n\nYea but I mean even like you were saying the church the church appointed \n\nThe kings\n\nOf Europe for centuries\n\nAnyone with power had the blessing of the church and without that you were nothing\n\nYea\n\nWell it definitely it definitely depends what parish you belong to because I know a lot of places at least in upstate New York have started having youth masses where like they have um like actual bands instead of that one 80 year old woman with the horrible voice who stands up there and sings they have like guys on guitar and stuff and everyone gets really into it and even the priest is like not using humongously long sentences and going on and on just about the passage like I think there's been a huge effort in a lot of places\n\nTo apply like the teachings more to life\n\nAnd to get people more involved\n\nAnd that should definitely be taking further\n\nI actually like church. I think it's relaxing I like to meditate  I don't I have to say I don't really listen too much to what's going on but I like the singing\n\nYea\n\nYea well faith inspires people\n\nI don't think so\n\nI think\n\nYea I agree I think but I think um you see like a disproportion number of priests or whatever becoming pedophiles because number one if they have that tendency they've just been put in this great position with authority over small children number two I think I think um they're not necessarily bad people and a lot of people who feel like the tendencies of pedophilia would become priests to try and control that the same way a lot of homosexual people used to to try and combat their urges or whatever if they strongly believe that as a Christian this was wrong  and I shouldn't be feeling this way\n\nI think it is I think it's a really I mean I understand that it's supposed to enhance a man's concentration on his faith and like give him more time to think about G-d instead of his sexual urges and his wife or whatever and his family but I mean are we we're supposed to find G-d\n\nIn everything and I mean I think it would help the Catholic Church a lot for priests to have a better understanding of what goes on in the families of their parishioners and\n\nTo be able to understand that too because um at my old church we had a deacon who gave homilies a lot and he was married and he had grandkids and it was great to hear him tell stories about them and everything and I mean it was great he gave great sermons \n\nUh-huh \n\nUh-huh\nYea I think they can mess you up\n\nEspecially I mean I know they have like a probation period or wherever where you go and tryout the whole celibate thing and living as monk or as like a priest and but I mean you can't predict what doing that for like 50 years of your life is gonna be like\n\nI don't think that really prepares people\n\nYea\n\nWow\n\nI have to say I never really thought about that before \n\nYea I think not enough people question their faith and that's why we get into arguments based on the letter of the law like with homosexual couples\n\nCause people aren't looking at it from all directions and trying to see it from other people's point of view they're just this is what I believe and this is what the bible says so\n\nI think if you ask them to tell you in a vacuum why they thought this was wrong why they thought women shouldn't be priests\n\nThey wouldn't be able to tell you with their own reasons\n\nCause it says\n\nRight\n\nYea\n\nYea yea that's true not only was it a different time period it was a different culture\n\nSo\n\nWhich makes it even harder to say that the Catholic Church needs to change cause there's still Catholics over on that side of the world. Maybe it's too global for its own good\n\nThings are so different in difference places\n\nYea\n\nYea it's so hard\n\nYea but honestly like 99% of Catholics know nothing about like Catholicism in like Africa or or the Middle East or Asia\nRight\n\n I mean much less much less from knowing about other religions and understanding their value systems and I mean they don't even know what different Catholics think I think if the Catholic Church is gonna remain like universal and global it it needs to do some educating to bring all its pieces together\n\nYea\n\n",

It's a self perpetuating thing\n \n Oh yea  well  cause  I think  education  has a lot to do with that\n\n I mean  in  in terms of education access  like  there are  big problems going on  but  they're not along gender lines\n\n They're along different kinds of lineations  but\n\n Yea  sure  um  by the time kids are nine  the ones in the suburbs can read at a level that's 3 years higher than the ones in the city   like  the Lower Marion school district in the suburbs of Philadelphia spends like $22,000 a year per pupil and the Philadelphia school district spends 9  cause schools are funded for property taxes  so if you live in a place with mansions  they can  pay good schools  if you live in a place with  um  blocks and blocks and blocks and blocks and blocks and blocks of row homes with no electricity  like Baltimore  then  you end up having things like  6% of kids who can pass a basic math test  9% of kids who can pass a basic literacy \n\n Cause that happened  last year\n\n Cause property  yea  cause  just the system feeds property taxes into the schools\n\n They did  oh really? It might have been charter schools.\n\n Cause  the  Maryland was the first state to step in under \"No Child Left Behind\"  and as a state take over municipal schools  and they did  and they turned them over to private investors  and they made charter schools out of them  which was a real good move  and those schools are doing good\n\n Oh yea?\n\n Yea  yea  Towson is gonna be doing a bunch of it  because those schools then have to compete in the free market  because every pupil that goes there  the state  or  the city  gives that school a voucher for a certain amount of money\n\n Yea  so  if you have private investors  they're gonna try and make their money back  so they're gonna try and do that through quality of education  so it's like\n\n Yea  it's a very healthy thing \n\n Well  I mean  it commercializes it  but it still publicizes it  cause it's still publicly funded\n\n But people are just competing in a healthy way\n\n Yea\n\n No  not as much of \n\n It's still an issue  but not as much of  in educational access  if that's what we're talking about\n\n Cause you can just as easily be born a boy as a girl  right?\n\n Oh yea \n\n Yea  right\n\n Have you  um  heard of Betty Friedan? The Feminist Mystique  the book \n\n Yea  I don't know  during the Cold War  there were  like  it was just like the culture  was  the man works  the woman stays at home  the man should want nothing more than to provide for his family  and the woman should want for nothing more than the husband with a secure  and  2.4 children and whatever  and like  that was just like  everyone's deal  and then Betty Friedan did the whole  almost like reinstating the draft for Iraq thing  only she was just like  wake up  you're not this stupid  you're worth something too ladies  so\n\n And  so  then  like  it's progressing in a good direction\n\n I mean  there's progress going on   I mean  it might not be  like  quick and all at once  aside from  milestones like suffrage  and stuff like that  but  there's progress going on  ya know  which is good\n\n Well  it's  um  ideally  it's really important to talk about it  especially  to at least talk about it  if not implement it  especially in places where there's none of it\n\n like  this school is 92% Caucasian  and  there are a lot of other schools which are the same way\n\n And I mean  the reasons for that aside  I feel like  if kids go to a really good school that it's sorta  homogenous like that  and those kids are gonna be wielding power  of one type or another some day  it's increasingly important that  they  kinda  poke the bubble  or start to poke it  a little bit\n\n I mean  not as much  not to the point where I think  that as a social problem  it should take priority  over the other way around \n\n I mean  like  I  I might get discriminated against  if I  go to  like  Zimbabwe   and I walk down the street  um  and  then  people would have all these kind of untested cultural assumptions they'd bring to me  like  oh  ya know  like  or like  when I went to Jamaica  like when I got a job down there  I was working there  it was like that  um  cause  it's like  oh  this kid's white  American  yea  he's loaded  obviously  just cause he  had the money to fly here  so  he's gotta be  and that was kind of an untested assumption  um  but I don't feel like that deserves  or requires as much attention as  the other way around  as like  as like a society where  say  ya know  men are holding  just happen to be a lot more CEOs  and they're holding that power  and  they are bringing  and  it's more institutionalized  ya know \n\n And they're getting public attention to it \n\n That seems like a big step in the right direction  right?\n\n",

        "[S4] They they have changed in the past I mean look at Vatican two. They changed the mass from Latin to uh ya know any language so I mean it's been shown that they can change so I think that they should let priests marry for one\n\n[S4] I also think the church should I don't know maybe modify some of its doctrines cause as of now they uh believe that if you're not baptized then you can't be saved I mean that kinda excludes a whole lot of people from \n\n[S4] Do you think if they don't change then like you're gonna run out of priests?\n\n[S4] Yeah\n\n[S4] Maybe they feel just like some of the rituals during mass are kinds empty.\n\n[S4] And one thing I don't get is uh  there uh  belief of transubstantiation I don't know if you guys know about that? how the body and blood becomes ya know the bread and wine becomes the body and blood of Christ I mean I see it as a symbol I don't really \n\n[S4] Yeah\n\n[S4] What I was thinking um going back to the original questions of priests marrying I mean if you took a survey of like all the Catholic priests how many would actually want to get married and ya know kinda give up that sacrifice that they made?\n\n[S4] There'd be a whole lot more reasons other than\n\n[S4] They do allow deacons to get married though. Which is kind of I don't know \n\n[S4] Even like Protestant religions they allow ministers to marry\n\n[S4] It seems to work for them.\n\n[S4] I mean it seems like there's a higher incidence than in other men\n\n[S4] I feel like they don't want to change their view because that would be a sign of weakness on their part\n\n[S4] Even though they kinda know that they're wrong.\n\n[S4] Yeah, I think so.\n\n[S4] I think it was like 97 that they uh like released Galileo's books from the list of banned books.\n\n[S4] Indulgences?\n\n[S4] I think some of the Protestant religions allow it because they just haven't been around as long as the Catholic Church so they have I don't know less tradition\n\n[S4] That's a good topic, yeah.\n\n[S4] Um I don't know I think they should change their opinion on sex in general they see it as just a way to procreate kinda like see it as I don't know dirty to do it for other reasons so I think they should change their opinions on that\n\n[S4] Right\n\n[S4] And plus birth control's been a such a great thing for humanity in general cause the world's over-populated as it is it's true\n\n\n",
        "Yes\n\nUm because I feel like everything that we go by right now in the church was made up thousands of years ago times have changed we don't stone people anymore I mean everything has changed so I feel like everything else has to change or at least adapt \n\nUh-huh\n\nThe thing is with that cause I argued the same thing and someone told me that back then there were women priests like\n\nYea\n\nThey were there they were allowed to be priests it was just the reason they were made to be like only men or whatever was the 12 Apostles\n\nSo I mean that I guess that even falls more on the church as a flaw\n\nYa know I don't really know \n\nYea\n\nYea\n\nRight \n\nYea\n\nThey were all written like at least in the New Testament they were all written 60 years after\n\nJesus died how accurate can they be\n\nMost are the same\n\nYea that makes sense\n\nUh-huh\n\nChurch \n\nUh-huh\n\nYea I mean like if we're if we can\n\nLike I feel like if the Pope can go ahead and make age limits for the eating not eating meat on Fridays\n\nI mean if we can go ahead and just make up that rule that only 19 and over and 55 and below  have to abide by that rule then what is the I don't see the point in doing it I don't see the holiness in doing it\n\nYea\n\nYea\n\nYea like I mean if if a human has the power to do that like \n\nRight\n\nUh-huh \n\nNo\n\nYea\n\nYea \n\nYea\n\nYea\n\nIs anyone not Catholic here?

        "Um  I think it's a stupid war.\n\nBecause it hasn't accomplished anything really  like people are just dying basically for no reason  and because nothing's changed  the only thing that came out of it was Saddam Hussein was taken out of power, but since then nothing productive has happened.\n\nOk, well then he should have ended the war after that. \n\nBut when we're reforming these other countries, we're not in war with them anymore  like\n\nWhen we were fighting Germany and Japan and all those countries  we had a good reason to fight them  like Japan bombed us  that's a good reason to start a war. But like once the war was over they didn't keep picking at it  like they let it  like yeah they helped it rebuild but that's because we destroyed their cities\n\nBut if it's a station that doesn't agree with Bush, it's obviously going to emphasize the negatives.\n\nYeah\n\nLike and they don't even want our help. They want nothing to do with us. They hate Americans  like why would we help a country\n\nEven with the world wars we saw a lot of negative but then we saw them liberating the Jews and stuff like that  like something good came out of it  nothing good is really coming out of this\n\nIf things were going well, why would they need more troops?\n\nThey'd gain more respect for him  I think\n\nI don't think  he's really gone past the point of redemption at this point  he's already made his mistakes  like he's not gonna win people back by taking people out\n\nYeah, he's done more than just the war.  But  ya know  he should just do something right for once  like\n\nBetween\n\nBetween what Clinton did for the economy  compared to what Bush has done for he economy  it just like  like it went down from when he got put into office\n\nYeah but when you're spending millions of dollars oversea on a war\n\nThat isn't like accomplishing anything  like  we're not gonna get that money back\n\nI'm not a huge Bush fan.\n\nNo. Luckily he can't run again.\n\nI don't know what else to say about him.\n\nUhhh \n\nWell, I remember reading something  I don't remember the details because I read it a while ago  about the guy who Bush put in charge of the war like stepped down  remember that?\n\nYeah  well it was kinda recent  I don't know  I think it was before Christmas, but I'm not sure\n\nUm  I guess like the guy had been wanting to step down for a while but Bush wouldn't let him cause like as his scapegoat\n\nSo  like I think Bush knows that he needs to pull the troops, but I don't think that he wants to admit that he was wrong and \n\nI think  I'm sorry  I don't even think like revising the way he's approached the war would necessarily make him  like make him have to admit he was wrong  it would just be like oh well let's try a different approach and see if it's more effective\n\nI think it would just be like  everyone would be like I knew all along  like \n\nYeah.\n\nFor the troops  they'd probably wouldn't be so gung-ho to support a country that wasn't behind them \n\nWait, so how do his parents feel like about him being an American soldier?\n\nBeing born in Iraq \n\nNo\n\nDo we have any other thoughts on this topic?\n\n\n\n",
        "I think as long as it is not a choice, then it should be legalized. Cause I mean, how can you discriminate against someone it's just like race I mean you have no choice in that just like gender discussions, you know? Cause if its not your fault you can't discriminate against someone for that\n\nWell for one, I think um two men or two women raising a child um the child missed the other portion like I think like a man and woman balance it out sort of like how we were talking about in the gender conversation um that's for one and also one thing I was just thinking of like randomly wondering either the [inaudible] or something um if you say that if being gay was shown to be like a choice or whatever like a complete choice and then you say it's ok like you have to say it's ok for everyone but then like if everyone was gay then this whole thing of like population like we wouldn't be populating the world I mean I thought of that like once I don't know\n\nWell, if it's a choice though then that's something that you can change like you might get up to a point in your life where you change that choice you know?\n\nExactly, yeah why would someone choose a life of discrimination that's like amazing\nI could see like a teenager though just being confused either just like being introduced to like their sexuality you know and all that or just to like rebel like just like break the norm and try like\n\nBut, I'm saying though instances where it could be a choice\n\nYeah\n\nDo you guys feel um that having them have like a marriage except calling it something different would be enough?\n\nIt seems like it shouldn't be the government's place to decide whether this is right or wrong cause\n\nYeah\n\nWell, yeah I mean its' definitely possible.\n\nWhat if it was uh shown to actually be something that they could fix, and I put quotation marks for the reporter. \n\nWhat if \n\nWell, it's just like the whole marijuana, cigarette thing I mean marijuana's bad for you its just more natural I mean it typically you go towards things that are more natural I don't know like in general you know\n\nI feel like um being gay definitely could be a combination of like nature but also nurture like as well so like I mean I don't know what kind of implications that would have like I know you said before um or we were talking about this for a while how um the government is worried about people raising someone gay so I don't know I mean if that came out what that would mean\n\nWell, I know a lot of times they say they can tell like you can tell like just from a child like like early on like they'll just have certain signs, and you know when they get older they're gonna be gay\n\nBut, I'm sure if like they'd you know given him all these big trucks and G.I. Joe's he probably woulda turned out the same\n \nGiving him trucks and G.I. Joe's\n\nWell, like I said before like for a teenager I could see them either getting confused or something.\n\nI'm saying like you have to make that clarification like\n\nIt was a defense mechanism.\n \nI mean, I can see people like like being uncomfortable like and I would say that's ok as long as like as long as you don't discriminate against someone or make them feel\n\nYeah\n\nBut, I mean even you guys like you said um you could never picture yourself like like being with a woman I mean I could understand how people could be like uncomfortable like don't want to like you know see like gay people you know \n\nEven like a regular couple doesn't\n\nYeah\n\nUm something I just thought of remember when we talked about gender discrimination? we said the government might not want to make it legal because it would show weakness to other countries um because they might not respect you know women like especially like the Middle East do you think there could be that side of it for this issue also? I mean I don't know like foreign stances on gay marriage really\n\nIt's not like a gay couple's going to be the president together or you know what I mean? it's like they already other countries are already well aware of the upri- I mean watch any of our TV sitcoms\n \nIt'd be it's kind of almost outrageous to think that it's not legal I mean if they prove for sure that it's not a choice then I mean how could the government discriminate I mean how could they justify\n\nMake some changes happen\n\nWhat have they proved so far? Do you guys know?\n\nResearch about it?\n\nYeah that's true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Yes\n\nYea I think it's ridiculous that gay people can't get married\n\nTo be honest um it I don't the government is a secular institution when people make the argument against gay marriage they're essentially arguing that marriage is a sacred institution that the government should protect but sacred implies religious and it's not the government job to protect religious institutions it's the government's job to issue licenses when a person applies for a marriage through the government they are applying for a marriage license that's a secular process\n\nI can see where you're coming from with that\n\nBut I think like people use similar arguments to argue against civil rights like in the sixties ya know I mean and that's something that had to be done\n\nAnd a lot of people felt ya know what I mean?\n\nLike people arguing that yes we should have civil rights like arguing in the sixties yes we should have civil rights but it's going to cause so much trouble for everybody that we should keep putting it off\n\nUh-huh\n\nExactly \n\nWell right now you can just ban same sex couples from applying for a marriage license\n\nThrough the government essentially cause when you when a minister administers marriage they're acting at once as both a religious minister and they're officiating an official government ceremony at the same time\n\nLike they're administering marriage you can you can still apply for a marriage license without having a ceremony done and still technically be married under the law but that's not necessarily the same as having a religious ceremony performed \n\nThere is no law against gay marriage. \n\nUh-huh\n\nNo\n\nIt's kind of been an unspoken rule\n\nFor a long time\n\nAll foreign countries do too.\n\nYea keeps the population down\n\nYea they got the \n\nThe Old Testament does.\n\nI think those are very literally interpretations of the bible too\n\nYa know what I mean? Cause the bible also says you should take an eye for an eye\n\nAnd people don't walk around gauging people's eyes out anymore either so I think that because it's such a literal interpretation of the bible, too it's something that a lot of people need to move past \n\nUh-huh\n\nIt is very explicit\n\nI mean most of the bible was written in the period of time when people the Old Testament at least was written in a period of time when people were living nomadic lifestyles and that kind of clan society was very important so you had to have people having children so that the lineage would continue so that you could keep passing down the property and the land and the animals and everything so it was important that you didn't breed like sons and daughters who were gay because then you wouldn't have grandchildren to pass to keep the line going and I mean I think a lot of the prohibitions of the that are in the bible against homosexual relations stem from that ya know what I mean?\n\nNo that's all\n\nA lot of recent research um has shown that there are different areas of the brain like psychological experiments have shown that there are specific areas of the brain that do appear to be different in gay people\n\nThan in like heterosexuals um and a lot of it's been very contested it's like one of those areas of scientific research that's kind of taboo nowadays because it's so hotly contested but um there's actually a research group out in I want to say Colorado working with the U.S Department of Agriculture and with um some other U.S science organization I forget the exact title but they're essentially they're looking at sheep populations essentially because it's a big problem for breeders for sheep breeders when they have gay sheep because those sheep\n\nYea they can't reproduce those sheep so if you buy like a male that you intend to breed and it turns out that that male is gay like you just lost like 4 or 500 hundred dollars on your investment and um they're doing research into it and they're finding\nYea they're putting them in like pens with other males to like chart their behavior and everything and they're finding that different portions of their brain are stimulated by the sight of a male sheep when they're gay versus when they're heterosexual\n\nYea I mean\n\nThere are gay penguins in the San Francisco Zoo.\n\nHomosexuality is not uncommon in the animal world actually\n\nUh-huh\n\nYea I mean I think it it does to a large extent come down to who you want eventually you want to ultimately be responsible for you in the event that you're incapacitated I think that's a big part of it too and I think that's something people have the right to choose and if they want to choose that within the context of marriage and outside the context of how whoever has normally defined marriage up to this point they should have the right to do that\n",
        " I feel like  if like you call it something else  I mean that's a direct violation of uh  ya know their right to get married  I mean  Why shouldn't they have the right? Because it was ordained in some council like  a thousand years ago that marriage was the right of the church to decide  um  I mean that makes this a hugely like conservative liberal debate because I mean the conservatives want to uphold  ya know  tradition thousands of years and liberals are all about social change  So I mean, in that regard I feel like leaving it up to the states to decide is like the better course of like action right now.  Making it a federal law would be stupid.  And I feel like my personal beliefs are I don't care, they can do what they want but it's better to leave it to the states right now. \n\nYea  to respond to  that you said  I just want to agree I mean  there are more churches than just the Catholic Church and first of all if I believe that you're a gay in the Catholic Church you should probably find a different church because  um  I mean the Catholic Church is very rigid  very  ya know traditional  um  but I mean  I know plenty of gay people who have  well I don't know plenty of gay people who have gotten married but  I've like heard of  ya know  churches that will do that and I mean  just because the heavily like  the believers who feel like this is somehow impeding their sacred vows of marriage  like  I don't really think that's a valid argument at all.\n\nI mean like  I don't personally  I mean I don't have a problem with gay people  I mean it kinda creeps me out sometimes but\n\nI don't care  like  and you see the people who are like  staunchly against this  you're like what right of yours are you protecting by not allowing them get married? I mean at least with the privacy issue that we were just talking about  there's some ultimate goal  some like  like reason why they're invading our privacy  to stop terrorism and stuff like that  what is behind the opponents of gay marriage? I just  I don't understand.\n\num  a couple of points  first one is  I mean there already are not like officially marriage  like agreements, contracts whatever  between two people like in every state  maybe this is between a man and woman too if you're not religious  I don't remember what they call this right now  like a civil union or something\n\nbut um  also  I mean  the people who feel like this is some kind of like  making their religion unpure or something  like I hate the like break it to the Catholic Church but thousands of years have made your religion unpure and like  I mean  the crusades  I don't like to bring up the crusades cause it's so cliché but \n\nI mean  do these things make your religion unpure? Like do the actions of others affect what you believe ? I don't think so.  Like  it shouldn't make a difference. \n\n well  I'm not trying to say like  Catholicism is like\n\nWell   I mean about that  um  you look in the bible you can find  and ya know  both sides of the argument  I mean you look in the bible  you can find anything you want to support whatever your opinions are\nAlso  just about  um  the Catholics  um  I mean I don't want to pin it on just them but  like  this is America\n\nWhere the majority of the population is  ya know  Christian  ya know  um  so  right now the people who are most  I mean this is just like factually  the people who are most opposed to it are like \n\nFor the  like taxation stuff  um  like that can be taken advantage of by anyone  like  it's like  man and woman too  so \n\nit's  I don't know.\n\nAgain  I mean  you have to pay taxes for everything  like \n\nlike  and  unfortunately the majority of our taxes are going to  like  the war right now  so  I don't know there are a lot of things that  that like I'm opposed to  that I still have to support monetarily  but I just live with it \n\nI think Bush should probably start like stop trying to change the Constitution   I think that's a good document  the bill of rights  like\n\nLike  the three words in the bill of rights  the most important word is rights  I mean  why would you have an amendment that says people can't have rights?\n\nit doesn't  make sense\n\nUnless he's on some kind of crusade trying to  like  break each of the original ten before\n\nhis presidency's over \n\nEspecially like  not now  that  ya know Congress is now the majority Democrat\n\nHopefully a lot of  especially the Democratic  like  congressmen  probably got into office like with the support of like  homosexual lobbies  so  to go back against their word  I mean politicians do that but \n\nof course with all the like  with the Catholic church  I think  aren't we debating that next\n\n",
        "Well, it's obvious that it hasn't gone very well but you can't hindsight is twenty-twenty you can't look back and justify to a degree your opinions based on ya know what happened you gotta base your decision on what information you have available at the time.\n\nBut what if we didn't go into Iraq and they ended up having Saddam had weapons of mass destruction cause I mean he's used them before on the Curds and Northern Iraq\n\nRight, we'd be saying why didn't we\n\nOr dismantle it\n\nBut, I mean one good thing that did come out of it was that we removed Saddam I don't think people understand how ya know bad his regime was. He, he if there was any signs of dissent he would just take people his secret police would take people and take them away and torture them and then kill them and their families too so I think it's important that he's out of power\n\nEven though it destabilized the country\n\nRight, people are different.\n\nIt's almost like it's almost like the U.S. has a cold war mindset still like they're trying to spread democracy but I mean there's no communism really left anymore so it really doesn't make sense why they'd still be doing that\n\nI think because the U.S. is the most powerful country that they see they see themselves as having the responsibility to intervene maybe that's where colonialism could come from\n\nI don't think they anticipated like Al-Kaida sending people to Iraq to like [inaudible] that's where they went wrong there I think\n \nIt's the typical case of choosing between you know the better of two evils.\n\nCause I mean if we stay it's like, what are we going to accomplish? But, how can we leave at this point?\n\nI don't know who does.\n\nI mean even the troops like don't even know what their fighting for\n\nAnd that's a morale killer\n\nYou look at World War II and the Gulf War and there's like there's like no other option you gotta fight wasn't really clear or at least there was a divided opinion for the Iraq War\n\nSuicide bombers\nI think it's hard for us to make educated decisions though, because we don't have all of the intelligence\n\nThat the decision makers have\n\nWe don't have the information.\n\nJust to stop terrorism\n\nIt's a good conspiracy theory.\n\nI don't know, but if that's the case\n\nI mean the end of oil is in sight it's within like a hundred years we're gonna run out of fossil fuels so we gotta find other sources of energy\n\nThey say they're making big strides but you know\n\nAnd there's a demand for it.\n\nI don't think it's a bad thing that they're doing that.\n\nBecause they've got to have a certain number of personnel and by hiring those defense contractors then that frees up the standard army soldiers so it like allows them not to be there for so long and everybody gets upset when people have to stay longer so I think that kind of alleviates that problem a little bit\n\nDo you think it could happen like with Iran? The same kind of thing? Or even North Korea?\n\nOr have we learned our lesson?\n\nYeah, that guy's a nut case.\n\nI think it's obvious that it's gone on long enough. But, I think that Bush just has to realize that ya know it's time to it's time to get out\n\nRight\n\nRight, he's not like an evil guy.\n\nI think the aim was to train the Iraqi police force and it just hasn't panned out like we thought it would.\n\nI think we should we should just let the informed people the analysts they should make the decisions, and not us and Bush should be open to their advice\n\nAnd they don't have a crystal ball. They're just making estimates.\n",
        " Yea \n\n I agree. For the same reasons\n\n What did they get expelled for posting?\n\n And they were able to get expelled for that?\n\n Oh wow \n\n Uh-huh\n\n Uh-huh\n\n Yea I think it's one thing to keep in your own mind but it's another thing to post it somewhere in public where everybody can see it I mean you can't really bust somebody for what they have in their mind because you can't think for them or hear their thoughts\n\n See I don't think they should have gotten expelled for that though\n\n Why I don't think I agree with you like ya know it's people I guess it's like not that I do that type of stuff but I guess those people were kind of expressing themselves\n\n In some way like it was whatever but I mean maybe get reprimanded or get something have to do something with the school but I don't think they should have gotten expelled \n\n Oh from her school\n\n Oh yea no I agree like with them coming in on like a gun shooting something like that where it could be physically harmful but when they have this it's they got expelled and did the kid in the situation even get expelled? Do we even know?\n\n So we can't even\n\n Was that a public school with the My the shooting that situation?\n\n Ok\n\n Were you a public school or private? \n\n Private?\n\n And he was expelled?\n\n I think they should draw the line kind of where we had it like when if it if it could physically harm someone then I think the line should be drawn but like stuff what happened in your high school not to how they're expressing themselves I don't think the school should really be able to have a say in something like that \n\n Uh-huh\n\n No I think it was basically said\n\n",
        " Yea  I think  you're right  there is a big pay gap  but still  like  I feel like you don't see as many like  women CEOs  like you just don't see a lot  of them\n\n Right  and then you have the whole family issue\n\n It is  yea \n\n Uh-huh  like  it'll still always being going  but  I think  it's being  getting a lot better\n\n Uh-huh \n\n And like  a lot more women  are obviously going to school  I mean  like  like  the average  I mean  the average  age  for a women  to  like  start a family  I know  went up  even  like  a lot \n\n And like  even  maybe to like  low 30s  so  I don't know  cause of all the schooling they have to go through to get to where they want to be \n\n   I know that's what it's like here\n\n Uh-huh \n\n Yea\n\n Yea\n\n Right\n\n Yea\n\n Yea\n\n Hm \n\n I think that's true\n\n I've seen that\n\n Uh-huh\n\n I mean  even at this school  like  I know diversity is shoved down our throat  like  I hear  like  every  I mean  I remember in orientation  like  diversity diversity diversity  everything  and  um  like  I'm gonna be an RA next year  and  um  that was one of the big things  like going into like  when they  came to choosing who was actually gonna do it  um  diversity was a big thing  because  there were a lot more  um  girls than guys  and  um  they knew  that like  they had to put like  a girl on a floor and a boy on a floor  and stuff like that\n\n Uh-huh\n\n Yea\n\n Right\n\n Not in America\n\n Yea\n\n Right\n\n Um\n\n Yea\n\n Like  I'm sure  like  males that want to be nurses  I'm sure that's not like\n\n Really socially accepted  or like  interior decorators  or  things of that  I don't  things of that nature  I really don't  think that  like  that's something that goes over real well  but \n\n Yea\n\n Uh-huh  I think you just don't think about it as much as  like  because  there's just not so much of a history of it  like ]\n\n Like men  in  well  way back  have never been  really  discriminated against  like women have  so I feel like that's just the reason that women are more focused on \n\n Hm  I [inaudible]\n\n Uh-huh\n\n No  \n\n Yea\n\n",
        "Uh-huh \n\nUm I like totally agree with that because I know I have um people in my high school got in trouble and expelled because of things that were on Facebook and MySpace so with putting things out on MySpace even though it is like um password and user name ya know protected anyone can get one so \n\nUm pictures of them it was like girl on girl like sexual things it wasn't like sexual like their clothes off but it's an all girls Catholic high school\n\nUh-huh because it gives the school a bad name\n\nAnd our school doesn't accept stuff like that so it's ok if it's like in your walls but once it gets like within the school cause I know I got suspended for something like that but it was within the school but it was once you put it out like there on Facebook or anyone \n\nCause teachers have Facebooks and it got to the point that you couldn't on Facebook you couldn't put like here's a teachers name and here's a quiz that you're taking\n\nYou have to like you have to take any type of identification of the teacher off of Facebook so got a little crazy [inaudible]\n\nYea \n\nI know private schools are a lot stricter\n\nYea they're like all up in your business ya know you basically get no type of privacy as soon as you put down a High School's name your privacy is gone so that sucks \n\nOh\n\nWell at least they got suspended for it but I mean it wasn't even like they were just doing it because I mean there's no guys there so you just kind of found a girl and just was like well let's do this and just it was just like for the fun of it you know that's so I don't know it was just real stupid I was like it's just real fun and I feel like in Catholic schools you are not really allowed to have fun it's all about like they're getting real strict about it you can't have your hair color needs to be natural no streaks no out there things you have to have one inch solid headbands I'm like y'all want everyone to be real uniform I'm like you're giving no one their individuality and it's like you're making like a little cult of I don't like that but\n\nI'm glad I'm gone that's all that matters\n\nYea\n\nWell he deserved that one. \nCause I think school officials oh I'm sorry go ahead\n\nHaving fun\n\nYea I mean cause I feel like they just keep I don't know I feel like school officials just like see everything black and white ya know and they school officials think ya know I'm an adult so they forget what it's like to be a kid and they forget like the changes that kids are going through and ya know what just like that stage of I don't know and they think that as a kid you're supposed to have that stage of I do know as adults do and that's just not fair to kids it's like they want them to grow up and it's not their time yet they'll have to allow to the kids to go through the stage of you know feeling out everything trying everything and as long as it don't kill you I don't see the point of ya know ya know have fun\n\nActually it's kind of like a parallel like the kids have to learn when things are going too far and so do the adults have to learn when things when like when they're invading too much of their privacy and kids gotta learn well ya know maybe I'm showing too much stuff here and I mean it's also just the fact that with my situation with my high school we had the same situation earlier cause like this girl um brought a knife to school by pure accident ya know she's the smartest girl in the world smartest, real active just brought a knife to school and I forgot the reason why but she got expelled because of it and she had no intention of doing anything with anyone it's just she just brought the knife to school by accident I don't know if it was in her car she wanted to keep it safe on her and they went through her stuff left her stuff on the bus went through her stuff and they had no reason to they just saw it there and decided to go through it and then they found it\n\nYea \n\nThat's not fair I was like you guys can file serious lawsuits off of stuff like that\n\nThat's like pressing the students like you know we're gonna do it so you know you know we're gonna check your lockers you know we're gonna be all up in your business so that's giving them a reason like well um if we know they're gonna do it this day then let's try and do it another day and just see if they can get away with it it's like kind of provoking them and trying to find a something to beat them or beat the system at\n",
        "There used to be a lot more gospels too \n\nThere used to be a lot of them  and then they’re were like  oh  Luke and john  oh  that’s it  no more  those 4 are it  yea \n\nCause the other ones didn’t agree  or  or cause  there were like specific problems with  um \n\nYa know  Dead Sea scrolls\n\nYea\n\nAnd  um  ya know  and this  this is just my opinion  and I wouldn’t  and I’m sure that there are like  theology buffs who would  ya know  argue this til the cows come home and hate it  but  I don’t know  I  I think that if you’re gonna talk about the like lessons that we’re supposed to be learning  I think like  ya know  Jesus and St. Peter  and all those people would be like  why are you people even talking about gay marriage and abortion right now  they would just be like  what  why  why are you even worrying about these things when there are so many more  like  pressing issues  to deal with and to think about \n\nYa know  like  people starving  and war  and poverty  and  just  a lot more\n\nThere’s all like injustice  ya know\n\nYea  the church \n\nThat’s proof  proof right there  that beliefs and the interpretation of the bible  are just  defined situationally\n\nThat they are  yea  and  and \n\nMore proof  of that  was like  I mean  you  we  we all learned about this in Western Civ  the divine right of kings  if God chose the Pope and the Pope chose the king  God chose the king  king can do whatever the hell he wants \n\nAnd  ya know  like church’s silent acknowledgment of the Holocaust  like  all these things  just situationally  like  well  ya know  we gotta do this  so  we’re gonna do this  it just doesn’t seem so infallible when you  poke at it like that \n\nDid you ever play that game telephone?\n\nImagine that  but 2000 years old\n\nOh  ok \n\nWell  but  the Holy Spirit has also fed poor people all over the world  and  ya know\nWell  the Holy Spirit guided us through the crusades \n\nAnd \n\nAnd now  the Holy Spirit is  making sure  we don’t let those gays get married \n\nHe was an idolist  he believed in nothing \n\nUm  I  I like  um  learning about religions more than practicing them\n\nI don’t really want to sign my name on the dotted line for one cause I think they’re all equally valuable\n\nAlright  I’m gonna stop \n\nThe Pope\n\nYea\n\nBut  Galileo \n\nCopernicus  everyone who wrote right after them had to put disclaimers in their books\n\nIn other countries too  I mean  like  a squirming 10 year old kid  isn’t really gonna want to sit in the pew for an hour  and then  kneel on that little thing  and  ya know  very very few kids are really gonna feel like they’re  I mean  cause kids are all like  ok  either I’m enjoying this or I’m not  and I’m not enjoying it  so  kids  it’s gonna be harder to find value in\n\nI think a lot  a lot of what we’re saying though is grounded in the types of churches we grew up going to\n\nAnd the types of things that we saw  but  in a lot of  other  kinds of communities  in a lot of other kinds of faiths  like  Christianity is like a tree trunk  with a billion and one branches  like  in Jamaica their masses are like fun  and  everyone’s all up on their feet  and it’s great  and  in  ya know  Baptist churches  in the south  or even in Southern Baptist churches in the north  people are all up on their feet  people are having fun  ya know  in all these  like  mystic religions  people all speak in tongues and all this stuff  and  even  ya know  like  there’s a guy downtown that gets 18,000 people to come to his church  once a week  it’s in an arena because he’s like  the sickest speaker ever   and he gives the best speeches  and  ya know  it really impacts people  and  all  although the church has done a lot of bad  like  I think it kinda has to be taken with a grain of salt  because they  although  I mean  it  it’s people to people  cause the church is only gonna be as good as the people who are doing it  so like  if there’s a missionary center set up in El Salvador  I think  it’s only gonna be as good as the people who are there staffing it  but  like  they do do a lot of good stuff  like  social service wise  ya know  just going into a neighborhood where people might  or a neighborhood area country mountainside  wherever  where people  feel like they don’t have a lot going on  they don’t have  ya know  a lot of positive things in their life  and  and giving them some kind of faith  ya know\n\nJust usually it’s Christian faith  and they’re like  now change everything you’re doing and do this instead \n\nOr at least try\n\nNo\n\nYea\n\nI  I think you don’t  and I think you shouldn’t  because  a certain altruistic  dimension to that type of work  is then gonna be lost in what you’re doing  because  you’re going there in a self-serving way  to try and  ya know  service your faith somehow  with some sort of superiority to theirs  so  even though that is a downside  and even though that is really troubling to me  every time I’ve seen it  which is just about any place you’ll travel to  where it’s going on  um  they at least deserve credit  because  they’re doing something  and they’re doing more than most other people  and they’re doing more than almost any other single organization  and they’re  and  and  like  a very very substantial portion of  of agencies which are really out there for social justice issues  are faith based  which for me  who’s definitely not a Christian person  it’s difficult  but like  I can still get over that and work with them because these are the agencies which are the most established  and which have the most  kind of social service infrastructure  even if it is  not entirely altruistic  and they are just trying to propagate  and proselytize  and whatever\n\nYea  to do good things or bad things  but  a lot of times good things too\n\nThey need an outlet for sexual frustration\n\nDo you think human beings or inherently  or  do you think that being  celibate  and not procreating  is  somehow contrary to human nature? Like that humans are inherently sexual beings  and then  this creates some kind of imbalance\n\nWhole procreation?\n\nAnd to do it  I don’t think they have to live this life of chastity\n\nWell  I’ve met a lot of  celibate priests and nuns who were really awesome and who were really cool people  and  I’ve also met a lot of them who are just  messed up\n\nIn the head  like  people who are just like  50  who are just  and act like they’re out of their minds  just  in the way they communicate \n\nlike  I  I saw this one nun who ran  um  a  kinda like a boarding school or quote unquote  troubled children  in a third world country  and  she was  she was just nuts  she was out of her mind  she would be smacking the kids  and stuff  and this is a nun\n\nAnd  and  I  I  I just saw  I came to see her  like  by the end of the day  and it’s just like  this big angry bag of sexual frustration that was taking it out on these little boys  and I was just like  what is this  like  ya know\n\nWell  you have to retreat into your own little world\n\nBecause you’re giving up a very substantial part of  a part of the world\n\nAnd watching everyone else go through it\n\nAnd some  and somehow being in a position of moral authority over them  where they come to you  asking you for guidance about things like this  and you’re just like  yea  well  Lord says that\n\nI know a lot priests who are alcoholics\n\nWho are raging alcoholics  people who are like very high-functioning alcoholics  like  they’ll get absolutely hammered at dinner  every single night  drinking like alcohol  and then get up and do a mass at 5 in the morning  and just be like fine with it  just cause  they drink a lot  and even  I’ve heard people say that they’ve just come to terms with  they’re like when G-d wants me  he’ll take me  sitting there  like smoking cigarettes  drinking  like  crazy stuff like that\n\nBut  I mean  our  our experiences  are like  the American Catholic Church\n\nAnd there’s Catholicism everywhere  and there’s Islam everywhere  and  Shintoism and Buddhism and  all those other stuff  all over the place  which  ya know  you really can’t come up with an argument that any one is more or less valuable than the others  so  I feel like  the only way that anyone could really be  like  a true anything  would be to know  and compare and contrast to the other ones  because  if you don’t know anything  about  Islam  then  how do you not know that it doesn’t call you and that you don’t feel more spiritually fulfilled  or visa versa  like  if you’re  if you grew up Muslim  and  you don’t know anything about Judaism  and then all of a sudden  you meet  some Hebrew dude who all of a sudden  I know with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  that sounds unfeasible  but  like  it really is\n\nBecause it’s wrong\n\nThe bible says  we’ll all go to hell\n\nAnd  and the reason that they would probably say  is because  there are no women priests in the bible\n\nWell  not  not they  I mean  you really can’t generalize like that  by bad  but like  the reason why  I think a lot of people would say  a lot of people would contend\n\nThat’s what Catholicism means though \n\nUniversal\n\nOr  they just don’t even about Catholicism  they just go through the motions  like cafeteria Catholics\n\nYou ever heard that term?\n\nI read this thing  by the Pope  in like 1986  I think it was  or some  some year  this big long papal thing  called  Gaudi in that said that it was the church’s  the church needed to  be dynamic  so that it could  the church needed to be dynamic so that it could fully engage in an ever changing world  I think is what it said  or so that it could fully engage with an ever changing world  like  I don’t know  how  do  things that were written in the Middle East 2000 years ago  translate to a global economy now for instance\n\nBecause  I don’t know  the same people who that gay rights and all that stuff is really bad  aren’t really looking at  a lot  other really horrible injustices  which  just  attention isn’t really called to as much  or which they’re apathetic towards  on a global scale\n",
        "I'm not quite sure about the logistics of MySpace. Is it  like Facebook?\n\nLike when you post something  like  can anybody just read it  or like \n\nYea  what are even discussing right now is privacy  and the whole point of MySpace is that it's not private  you post is so that people read it \n\nI mean  the internet is a really debatable issue  I mean the government has been really on the edge between like  invading privacy and what not  and certain things like instant messaging like when you're having a private conversation  I mean  that's closer to being an invasion of privacy than my space is \n\nWe're just  ya know  examining the difference in like privacy and safety  I mean  it's a really thin line  between them  like  um  uh  I think it was Benjamin Franklin  who said  those who give up their essential liberties in order to [inaudible] uh  safety  deserve neither liberty nor safety  and  um  I don't know  that quite quote like really  I don't know]\n\nthose who give up their essential liberties in order to purchase some temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety\n\nso  I mean  there's this whole I mean like the Patriot Act  where  um  I mean it helped prevent terrorism  but it also did a lot of bad things too  and  ya know  whether it should be legal or not is a huge problem right now \n\nI mean  I know like  I think we're pretty much like agree on the fact that\n\nlike the MySpace thing is not really an invasion of privacy  but  I mean  you talk about like internet conversations  and like  phone calls  being monitored  I mean  is this  this is  this is definitely an invasion of privacy and this shouldn't be allowed just  ya know  to combat terrorism\n\nI mean  that's exactly the point  they're not going to monitor your conversations  because  you're a white, female, college student  they don't give a crap at all about you  um  I mean  this is going to be like racially profiling  this is gonna be like  ya know  ya know  Arab people, black people probably  I mean  is that fair? Is that right?\n\nyou also have to ask  ya know  how many terrorists are actually caught? Ya know  because of ya know  let's say the Patriot Act  I mean  you'd definitely hear about it if it happened  the media would definitely like  hype up  this up  because it shows that the Patriot Act is working  but  I have not  ya know  I watch the news pretty regularly and do not see much of this at all  I've seen more instances of people taking of it because of the Patriot Act  so \n \nI don't know  like certain things where they use the Internet to catch people  they'll like make up a fake name  and then talk to someone  I don't have a problem with that at all\n\nIt's their fault for talking to some random stranger  ya know  getting caught because of it  but if two people are having a closed conversation\n\nhow should that be any different from a telephone conversation or just a conversation like we're having right now \n\nThanks to the Patriot act they don't need one. \n\nI guess  I didn't know  are there like privacy features that you can have like  just  your friends see you  cause  I knew there was like the thing  where like  anyone who went to the same school as you could see you\n\nInstead of getting  I mean  there's also  like  question if like you actually like  put up a picture of you like breaking a law  it's like  if you put up like a picture of you smoking from a bong or something  like  that's just a fault of your own self not having any discretion  like \n\nNot necessarily. I just think that you shouldn't be stupid \n\nBut I mean  if you're not the government  let's say you're a company \n\nhiring someone  they don't care if it's [inaudible]\n\nSomething else about  you mentioned  uh  like cell phones  like only giving out your number to certain people  as of the recently  uh  all cell phone numbers were released to like  the  phone  um  I don't know what they call them  the phone spammers\n\nTelemarketers  yea\n\nbut I mean  should you have to do that \n\nI mean  I still feel like that's an invasion of privacy  even there  [inaudible] the line should be drawn\n\nI mean  I don't think you can really  can  draw a line  I mean  even if you could pinpoint the exact point where like  I don't know  it's fair to  like invade people's privacy or whatever  I mean  there are still gonna be exceptions  like  I mean  there are gonna be people upset wherever you put  the line  I mean  there's always going to be this gray area  you can't really do anything about \n\nBut who would be voting? \n\nYou have to ask like who should have a say  I mean  should the administration have a say? I mean that's gray area too.\n\nI'll say  I think the line's  being very poorly drawn by the current administration  I don't think they want any lines  at all  so\n\noh  the country  right now  I don't have a problem with Loyola.\n\num  just in everything  I mean  I keep bringing up the Patriot Act  I feel like this is a huge invasion of privacy  I mean  overseas even  there's an invasion of privacy  is that  where the line  should there be a line drawn  like  across that  I don't know.\n",
        "I think that the problem about it is that it's like the religious aspect.  So I think if they called it something other than marriage more people would be like, ok.  It's not like marriage in the traditional sense it's [inaudible] for a lack of a better word in like the modern sense.  And so I think more people would be like this is what they want and it doesn't really conflict with my views on like whatever religion it is that they are and um then it would be like more like accepted since its like a different culture aspect almost.  But um as into like what types of states like is it what type of states have it and why? \n\nI know like I'm pretty sure it was like New Hampshire that like has it. Might be wrong on that but um if you think about it they're more of traditionally like a liberal state from what I remember and I guess it's not to like stereotype liberals but like they're more open to like ideas even if the names stays the same.  So if you have like a different like I was saying before like a different like way of putting them together like two women or two men together and like calling it something different and having it a little bit different than like a traditional marriage then I think it would be more accepted because it wouldn't really conflict with anyone's like personal  \n\nYea, that's what I thought I was getting at more or less. \n\nYea, I guess that's what that's what I was trying to get at but I didn't like have the terminology or I didn't think that way of putting it but yea that's exactly what I was getting at.  The separation of church and state is like a huge part and like I guess if you don't conflict with like the church or whatever religion like cause it's just not Catholics that believe that um then like people would be like, ok well they're not trying to change my religion or me views or like my culture this is their views and their culture and I can accept it because they're accepting mine and they're not really stepping on anyone's feet and so yea.  But I agree also the state should be like the one deciding because if it's like up to every individual or town or whatnot it could be like so crazy.\n\nI think that once they leave that state it's not recognized\n\nBy some some of the states isn't that the case? I could be wrong.\n\nRight, Right\n\nI'm pretty sure cause I have a lot of like older people who are like my friends and they're like gay or lesbian and they have partners but I'm pretty sure like my state doesn't recognize if they would get married like it wouldn't recognize it so I could be wrong on that but I don't think that they do.  But um like sure if that's what they want  I would like to see them happy but I don't know I guess it's like it's a tricky topic because a lot of people are so set on like if like we legalize this it's going to create a dominos effect and everything is just gonna like change but I don't know\n\nLike I was saying earlier a lot of people it has to do with their religion um like it's and like I said earlier it's not just Catholics like I'm pretty sure Jews are the same way and other religions like a lot um how do you feel if gays or like lesbians get married then it goes against like it's a stab in like their back saying like oh my religions not be honored almost in a way or it's being made fun of or something like that so I guess that's why I feel maybe if it's called something different like you can still say marriage but maybe if you have something else also\n\nYea like\n\nright but it's kinda slightly different but like they'll still get the benefits because they are married and like they won't offend anyone else because it's not like stabbing someone else's religion back in the back it's not like its own religion but it's different so\n\nit's like you live seven years or something \n\nYea that's a good point though like if people just don't like something they'll just say oh well I don't believe that so I can't or like but um also in [inaudible] the crusades and everything like ok I guess the reason why I'm trying to get it away just from Christianity and like slash Catholics it's cause like I don't like it how like everyone always pins it on the Catholics or Christianity saying that oh well they're opposed to gay marriage so let's just like harp on them for not allowing it because a lot of religions in the past have been corrupt and like everyone always studies in history oh the Christianity the Catholics oh they had all these corrupt popes but like there were so many religions before that and after that now that are like corrupt  and like it's kinda glossed over and so to pin it on like one religion stopping gay marriages from happening I don't think it's really fair but I mean I understand why it's done because it's like what all what people learn about in school.\n\nNo, I know\n\nNo, I'm not just saying that like in general cause like \n\nYea\n\nExactly.\n\nRight\n\nNo like yea that's because like that's like the majority are living here in America but if you go like to another country you're going to get a totally different reaction from a totally different religious group so I don't know I just I just think how religions dictate everything\n\nseven years\n\nRight \n\nYea \n\nFrom what I know it's just his views which I don't think is good \nI think I don't think there should be like a law against it I mean that's taking away someone's freedom \n\nI don't think it's [inaudible] in that category personally so I don't think one has to really worry about that \n",
        "I'll start. Um I'm um fairly opposed to the United States um occupation in Iraq um I think that it has gone on for beginning in the first place was probably a bad idea but um given the circumstances this is going on for entirely too long now and um no matter what the outcome um may end up being it's a loss if you're going to go [inaudible] which is the United States people usually look at every situation it would be a L a loss I don't think you can really justify um any other way even at this point if um the Iraqi people thirty years from now have a flourishing democracy which won't happen um you have to look at what's already transpired and say that um it's a failure\n\nHe said that he would veto any bill that would pertain to them leaving. I mean he's been open about the fact that he wants to stay there, and the congress is almost an afterthought. Even though, they traditionally and I guess by the laws should have stayed\n\nOh ok.\n\nOh, you're saying in the first place\n\nWould you guys all agree though? The longer you stay in there the more it becomes modern day colonialism?\n\nIt's whatever works best for us.\n\nYeah, that's that's I agree with that I mean \n\nIt was similar to like Kosovo was where you go in and take down a dictator who oppressed people of a certain nationality within their country but that's like another difference I guess that you don't I mean how many Americans know the difference between you know the Sunnis and the Shiites which would be the largest internal problem that they have in that country and the Baptists or whatever you want to say the different political parties and we didn't do anything about that so they're all in favor of going to help out you know a country but, within that country there's so many subdivisions that\n\nThat's the next presidency's problem that's the which is gonna be to get out of there so that's gonna be your solution\n\nNo, I'm not saying necessarily it's what I would do either, but like that's gonna be one of the main things you're voting for on the next ballot is what president is saying we're leaving one presidential candidate saying we're leaving and the other one saying we're not\n\nOh, I completely agree.\n\nUm well I mean most of their experiences if they're coming back I mean I think it's either injury because they need everybody over there they can I mean that's the problem at this point you have all these your reserves the reserves are you know your soldiers and they're not soldiers necessarily they're prison guard which isn't even their training um you know for sorry at uh you know like [inaudible] where there's you have to be prison guard for I guess what they figure the most dangerous terrorists in Iraq and there the training was you know just general infantry and they sat up in North Carolina for three years\n\nSure, absolutely\n\nWell, just look at statistics and infer what you want.\n\nYeah, but you you get broad you're getting all these broad ranges that are kinda similar it's not like the Holocaust where you go from six million to sixteen million it's like the numbers are all pretty similar\n\nAbsolutely, that's just what you read in [inaudible] right?\n\nBBC\n \nI mean I don't have if that's towards me, I don't have an answer for that I think that's why they're gonna be elected that's why I'm not running for office\n\nSee, I disagree I don't think the situation has even happened\n\nOk\n\nHow long does it take to formulate an idea? Like eight years? Is that what it is? Is that what it's gonna be?\n\nSo, I mean if the best thinkers in our country can't come to some kind of reasonable conclusion for occupation there or for prolonging of our occupation there, then they're obviously they shouldn't be ok\n\nCause you can't, you can't keep you can't keep people slowly but surely dying and losing their will to be in a place and the cause the cause there are people fighting now that when the war started were probably had never probably had very little idea where Iraq was because they were so young cause they were they were young high-schoolers\n\nRight, but we see dude those were the ones where they would have previously gone to the reserves and so forth that doesn't happen, and with the cutting and funding to um to um oh what's the type of school uh high school it's like another branch of high school where you just do like engineering type things um skipping on the word right now, but they cut funding on that\n\nNo uh\n\nVocational vocational education right they cut funding the Bush administration cut funding like significantly which also increased um the amount of um applicants for the reserves because a lot of kids that are old enough to apply for that instead of going to their two year program they went to war so it's like everything is indirectly connected, but when they're people you cut funding to where you get lower income um student's from like low income housing or housing families that need the certain education, but need to work at the same time so, they can't go to a four year they go to a two year vocational school, but no, there's no money for that so they go in \n\nOh, that was like two years ago? Three years ago?\n\nAnd, it's something like in middle you know but\n\nLike, you mean other countries?\n\nWell, I don't think you have to worry about like Iran and Iraq getting along at some you know what I mean at \n\nI don't know.\n\nIraq doesn't apparently.\n\nIt's not just gonna like here today and not here tomorrow I mean it's a gradual process, but if you're gradually going to be adding more people there you should at least I mean why not gradually be taking people away giving them more power of their country slowly but surely as opposed to just adding just signing a bill where you add 10,000 more troops you know what I'm saying?\n\nIt's almost like, you're gonna have to get the ball rolling in one direction and stay with it and the direction of the ball you know it's going is more people, more time as opposed to less people, less time because otherwise, everything we've done there I mean, it's nothing because we're supposed to be training part of like the objective here was to to train Iraqi forces uh you know policemen, soldiers and so forth to maintain their own country like that's what we had the guy who came and spoke here he was a former the volleyball coach or cheerleading coach here was part of a unit where trained a bunch of Iraqis and he taught they learned the ropes and the American soldier way and so forth, and they're supposed to be the future of you know of you know Iraq\n\nYeah, I mean yeah I do but that's like a that's a couple years\n\nHaiti also um since the transatlantic slave trade has been I mean went on I mean it's had its own issues, plus it has a civil war and\n\nI would say there's better examples in South America that where we placed people to make quick fixes I mean like um Pinochet didn't the United States hand pick him a general there? The military weren't we like, oh that guy's fine? He could be the and Noriega was the same way until he got caught drugs and now he's in prison in Miami or something like that but that's the whole prison of the United States um\n\nWe just make a lot of them.\n\nOh, I know I mean I'm not\n\nNo, I mean over the next like uh three to four four to five I mean if you stay there ten more years then then you've been occupying another country for how long we've been there? Was it 2000 and two? Three?\n\nNo, I mean we're always gonna have military bases we have military bases in every country I think we've ever been in a war plus all the countries we haven't you know we're the United States they have embassies in \n\nRight, but we have embassies and military bases in the Philippines like Iraq is a place they need to have military bases in because of proximity next to Iran, proximity to Israel\n\nWell, no, pulling out of the situation they're in where they're trying to help you know run a country or support a country\n\nWell, well [inaudible]\n\nBut, Democrats won congress because of this more or less because people wanted to see change and specifically in this field\n\nAbsolutely\n\nWell, it's pretty you can't just float around in the middle for something like this\n\nYeah, but I think if they ever passed something legislation it wouldn't be like the extraction of 20,000 troops it would never say that you know it'd be like two thousand this month and \n\nUm Vietnam\n\nYeah, but Vietnam's like totally different it's comp- you can't even compare Vietnam to Iraq\n\nCause, cause like Vietnam was first off, part of the containment policy which is like in itself the age old\n\nWas it a war?\n\nNo, technically it waswas Vietnam a war technically was that\n\nThis isn't a war either right\n\nYeah, but, terror isn't a country.\n\nWell I mean no absolutely  I mean people are always comparing things to Vietnam because people want to look at how poorly we're doing that doesn't say people don't want us out of there too\n\nNo, and I know but, it's a long time in the grand scheme not in the grand scheme of things, but in the American perspective, which is the perspective that everybody that votes in this country looks at and Britain looks at it I'm sorry, Britain and um England, France, all those other countries that were that were supporting us and were our allies in the beginning and now they don't \n\nWell, they don't because they see it as a lost cause and they're like they don't want to have their country's name associated with it any longer\n\nHmm.\n\nThere's no way that England or France is afraid that the Iraqis are gonna start to attack them. \n\nOk.\n\nThey also have larger I mean there are populations within France specifically so even that's their own that's France's own um \n\nYeah, that's a like real xenophobic culture, and like that's a problem but at the same time like it's also different because Europe obviously is different because the cities is where the more affluent people live and the outskirts the suburbs are where more poverty is it's completely different than our country so people in Paris they're not really as afraid as \n\nBut, it matters. It matters like a lot what the foreign the foreign perspective especially, being those as our closest allies\n\nAbsolutely\n\nNow correct me if I'm wrong, I believe I heard the statistic that in the four years the four years we've been there um the amount of Iraqi casualties and injured has caught up like some outrageous number from from Saddam's regime\n\nThe only thing that he did do and I'm not supporting dictators of any sort, but he um gave structure to their country anarchy\n\nWell yeah I knowI'm not like, yo let's kill em to make em serious\n\nNo, you don't you don't and we put them in power, so \n\nBut, didn't you find anything wrong with the fact that like we went in there um because of weapons of mass destruction\n\nOk yeah ok\n\nI don't think we're as far apart.\n\nI think we're just differing on the whole leaving\n\nOh, sure its people\n\nThis is next topic\n\nIt's cause it's cause I mean it's cause it was unfinished business from the Secretary of Defense and and the first Bush's administration Chaney the Vice President I don't know there's all kinds of\n\nAnd that's why a lot of people blame Chaney\n\nObviously\n\nAbsolutely\n\nYeah, but that's what we're saying it's not I'm saying um \n\nRight, exactly and Chaney was not slapped in the face because Desert Storm was much more successful than this has been but at the same time Desert Storm didn't take Saddam Hussein out of power, which was [inaudible]\n\nBut, it was shorter.\n\nNo, I agree with you.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Yes\n\nAnd actually  I looked up online  cause I am in a  like  homosexual relationship  and  I looked up online  and I saw  was like  the actual term marriage has nothing to do with a man or a woman at all  it means just  a common  like  union  a civil  or  um  what's the other word  it was a civil union between two people  who live in the same home and share domestic  and  um  sexual relations  that's all that marriage is  it has nothing to do with that  and I'm like  it's like  you're trying to separate church and state  and I'm like  well  you're not even doing that  if you're  I mean  cause honestly  I kind of see where they're coming from  cause I had like a big discussion about this in my room  and a lot of my friends are like  they want to  it should be legalized  but  you'd have to understand that  marriage  like  the country was based on men and women  that's how  like  all of us got here  and so  it's gonna be hard for them to just change something as  like  concrete as that  but  I wouldn't mind it  I would just be like  like  make the civil unions  or  that they have  like  allow the same things that come with marriage just don't allow the title  if anything  because  I read a paper on it  it was actually like  all you need to do is just get forms  if you want to change your last name you can get a form and change your last name  if you want to  like  make  um  your partner become a guardian you  so that  just in case you go through legal problems or  medical problems  your parents don't have that right over you  still  so  there's like things that you  there's a lot of paper work  and when the title or marriage comes in  it's like automatically  and if they just allowed for civil unions  to  just  have all that  and just not the title  everyone would be so much happier\n\nYea\n\nYea  cause I feel like our generation is gonna be like the most like  tolerant\n\nYea  cause I mean  I feel like we're gonna be the generation that's like  ya know what  as humans  you all have  we all have certain rights  and  although it may not be what  ya know   this human may like  it's like  ya know \n\nYea\n\nYea\n\nAfter the generation older  leaves\n\nYea\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nOh \n\nThat's why I think it's just like  like the whole civil rights movement  and  like  just  um  and even Latinos had a struggle  to get what they wanted to get  um  equal rights  as like Caucasians and stuff  and so  I feel like  you have to  really  there's  nobody really recognizes  as change or as struggle if there wasn't a fight  to get to that\n\nAnd  that's even like  that can be applied in college  that can be applied like  everywhere  if  once there's like a fight to show that you really got what you wanted  and it  is when it's gonna be the most recognized \\\n\nSo\n\nYea\n\nIsn't it that states can do  kind of do  what they want  for their own group of people  and then it's up to like  the government  to do like the national things  but  that's why it's only like certain states  like  who's it  like  I know Massachusetts has it  um  New Jersey just\n\nYea  New Jersey just got it  and  I forgot about  and California I think\n\nYea\n\nUh-huh\n\nI feel that more so that  they're just  they're really  cause my parents are both Caribbean  and as a Caribbean that's like the biggest no-no of life  they would \n\nYea  Caribbean  I mean  Caribbean parents allow  surprisingly  they allow for  a child to  a girl to get pregnant at 15  they'd be like  ya know what  ok  let's go  let's do this  they don't like abortion  but  they  will not  they  it's  they're really against it because it's just something that  just  they're like  those are the people in the Caribbean that are just stuck  in  Catholic ways  or  in my case Episcopalian ways  it's really stuck with that  and they're like really bible reading  we do what the bible says no matter what, type of people\n\n Yea  it's in  I think it's in Romans that says it\n\nIt says that homosexuality is a sin  but  it's a sin like any other sin though  it's a sin like  I don't know  gossiping \n\nNo  that's like  that's like a  up there sin\n\nYea  like gossiping  or basically just doing  like anything  just wrong  not wrong like murder and not wrong like  like  one of them 7 deadly sins or whatnot  those are gonna get you sent directly to hell  but  like  it's just like a sin  like  any other  small thing that committed another day\n\nAnd they say then  Huh?\n\nI don't know  because when  I  I was at a point where I just didn't  um  like  my parents are really  are really down in their ways  and I was always brought up just reading the bible a lot  so I just kind of had to get away from it  because  I was to the point where everyday I was like  ya know G-d, I'm sorry  like  everyday\n\nFor being\n\nNo\n\nUh-uh  but  I'm  I don't know  let's  not  that's a discussion for another day\n\nBut  I don't know  they  I forgot what\n\nYea\n\nYea \n\nBut  then again  it's like  that  that thing though is like really  like \n\nYa know  it's like really  an eye for an eye\n\nYea  and at the end of that  it says that  um  just like an other sin  it will always be forgiven  and I'm like  that should  it's just too much to go through as a teenager  and like  in this year  in this day and age where everything about yourself you kinda question  and just to walk around thinking that you can't do this, you can't do that, you can't do this  it was just too much  so\n\nI kinda feel like it's just something  just like your personality  cause\n\nYea  and I feel like  cause I'm taking psychology now  so it's one of the things that I'm kinda like \n\nYea  Yea  I'm kinda up in the air on stuff like that  because  it's like  I feel like it's not something like that's in your genes  to  just how you're gonna be  cause I feel like it's kinda like  um  almost like a personality thing  and I  it's like  it's kinda like personality in the sense that  it's like  something that's developed  it's either you're a nice person  or you could be nice sometimes  it's like a  up in the air type of thing  I feel like  being  um  in  being homosexual isn't something that is  like  ok  here's a gene that  that  this is the gene that's defected or something like that  for  um  you to be homosexual  I feel like it's just something that you're kinda  there  with  I guess\n\nYea\n\nWow\n\nThat's funny.\n\nI can't stand President Bush  at all  because\n\nDemocrats are like the  a really liberal, liberal group  and  they are  kinda like  I mean  ok  I saw this  in this paper that I read  it said  that history can't define the definition of marriage  and  that's exactly what he's doing  I feel like  because  he is from Texas and because  like  a lot of Texans are like deep rooted and what they know  and this is how  they've always existed  I feel like he's bringing his personal aspect  to  the government  and it's actually not the government's decision  as to who a person should love  or who they want to spend the rest of their life with  ya know  and it  I feel like  he's just taking his personal  whatever he thinks  and just like letting it go  on everyone else  and it should be more of like  the people saying  this is what we want to do  you're here to serve us  not the other way around  so\n\nAnd that's why he's losing\n\nHis  poles are like  into the ground\n\nYea\n\nThat's true  that's like  cause a lot of  like  from back in the day  that's what they like  the government came in and was like  this is  ya know  I'm the government  you're the people  you adhere to me  and that was like the purpose of a lot of the  rules and stuff that were made and a lot of the different treaties and all those other type of things  were made to allow  for the government to kind of back away  and let the people kind of do what they want  and  in the sense  and the paper that I  I keep bringing up the paper that I read  but  it's like  this woman  they  there's a couple  they were gay  and  the woman  one woman got in a car crash and had a brainstem injury so she was like  in  like  this vegetative state  but she could still communicate  through like her eyes and through her like smile and stuff but she just couldn't speak anything  and  because  they  they felt they were married  but  the law didn't see them as married  so  it allowed for their parents  her parents to still have guardianship rights over her  and  um  they put her in a facility that did nothing for her to come back  to  ya know  at least  moving her fingers  moving her muscles around  being able to kind of walk at all  because of the fact that her father just didn't really like her  her father wanted her to die so he put her in like [inaudible] place that didn't do anything to help her  and  that's why  if they had  instituted like  ok  well  ya know  allowed people certain rights  because they are violating rights  they're violating  well  because she was disabled it violated her right to speak  and  ya know  all those type of things  it's just  I could go on for days about this topic  sorry \n\nYea\n\nI feel like it's another form of racism  in a way  it's not racism of color but it's racism of people's lifestyles  and  just  like  kind of hindering them to  just conforming to what everything  what everybody else is doing  and  it's like separating them  I mean  for some homosexuals  like  if you just saw me on average it wouldn't come to mind that  ya know  maybe she's gay or something like that  but  it's just  it's not something that's worn but when people find out  they're kind of like  well she's gay so she needs to go to the side  and  ya know  it's just another form of discrimination  I guess you could  it's not really racism  I guess racism is discrimination in a way  so\n\nYea\n\n",
        "I I think it’s still a problem.\n\nI think that once you’ve established some kind of disparity that you can never really fully recover\n\nThe good thing is that there’s like a conscious effort to overcome that.\n\nYou sound like you’re reading a \n\nYeah, but it’s not cause like you’re better at it\n\nThat a historical condition it’s not truth\n\nThat’s true, but\n\nI don’t think they do.\n\nThey were treated like that.\n\nDo you call it like an office assistant?\n\nWhere do you work?\n\nBut, it’s mean.\n\nAlright. What about other things for women that don’t have as much of a stereotype but maybe like a science career or something?\n\nYeah yeah like high up\n\nYeah yeah like high up\n\nI think that’s more accepted. Wait what do you think is more accepted, the male in the female role or the female in the male role?\n\nThe female in the male role or the male in the female role?\n\nGuys do gymnastics.\n\nBut, it’s a female sport.\n\nReally?\n\nIt’s like once you get over the hurdle \n\nDid you wrestle them?\n\nWould guys try to be like easy on them?\n\nBut, if the girl’s really good\n\nWas he the only one that ever lost a girl?\n\nWell if you’re blind and you’re wrestling\n\nYeah\n",
        " This is gonna bring up Bush again.\n\n That's still a big accomplishment though.\n\n Yeah, I know. Ya know  you can't really exactly pull the troops out of there. I've talked with a soldier about this exact topic and he said that if we do what a lot of people in America wanna do which is just take everybody out of there then like all of this friends died in anguish  and that's just not cool at all.\n\n How are we losing?\n\n But um  when I was talking with that soldier  what he was saying was  um  if you look at like previous wars  while the U.S. is in a different country and we're looking to reform \n\n What's that?\n\n No. What I was gonna say was it's taken a boatload of time to actually make and effect in that country  like with out effects  like uh  I don't know a hundred percent of what I'm talking about so ya know  if I screw up let me know  but I think after World War II we were in countries and I think even today we're still helping them reform  um  like now I just don't understand how you guys would expect us to make a change over in the middle east when it's only been such little time I guess  when in perspective with history\n \n That was crap.\n \n It's the media. The media only portrays that stuff most of the time because that's what catches their attention. Then on the other hand, we could have moved them.  I don't think we know exactly what's going on  ya know  behind closed doors  I guess you could say\n\n Um  that's another reason why I kinda support Bush in this sense  that's a way out there comment, I know  99.9% of America would not agree with me on that one  uhh  the thing that I believe is if you have a leader who you're not going to accomplish anything ever if you don't support him or her in the future  but if it's Hilary then that's just out of the question  no on should support her\n\n Well, that' because the media  I believe\n\n Cause that's what grabs our attention\n\n That's 99.9%\n\n I had two very valid comments, but now they're gone.\n\n So is that just like lack of enthusiasm?\n\n But that's what they signed up for.\n That's another media thing\n\n When did this happen?\n\n It's a constant battle within myself I guess you could say. I don't want Americans over there or anything, but on the other hand  I don't want everybody just to leave and have them sent home with an emptiness   I guess is what we're talking about  I wouldn't want that like  with everybody coming home  I'd want something to big to happen at least before everybody comes back  or bigger than what everybody's thinking right now\n\n That's cause pride's a very big issue  yeah\n\n Mixed messages\n\n What do you guys think would happen if Bush  if he did take everybody back?  What do you think the people who hate him right now would like\n\n Oh really  cause I think they'd be like oh it's about damn time  oh we still hate you and you still suck\n\n Well I don't mean to bring in everything, but he did an amazing job with the economy\n\n No, no, no. Macroeconomics\n\n Very true.\n\n It also takes a long time for stuff to kick in  so sometimes when one President does something\n\n Sometimes that takes time\n \n It's not the same what?\n\n I don't think many people are huge Bush fans  ya know  I kinda am like sticking out for him, but I'm not a huge Bush fan\n\n I really have nothing to base off of  or not a whole lot to base everything off of so I think I'm gonna \n\n No\n\n But would I pick Bush over Hilary? I'd pick Bush.\n\n Yeah  hate Hilary\n\n That's a different topic\n [inaudible] But, I think we're straying off topic. Cause that's kinda goin nowhere.\n\n Tryin to like frantically think of something to say.\n\n Was that just recently?\n\n Especially since it's the United States I mean\n\n Well what would\n\n If he would say that he messed up like I'm sorry for the war  like what type of effect do you think that would have on America and on the troops?\n\n No, it'd be horrible  but like what type of effect do you guys think?\n\n I told you so?\n\n What about the troops?\n \n Most of em'\n\n Does he have connections over with  people in Iraq  like his family? \n\n Like they talk about him  like what's going on and everything?\n\n Cause that'd be like an interesting perspective\n \n Touchy subject\n\n\n\n",
        "Alright\n\nYea I don't really think it was an invasion of privacy considering they posted a Myspace bulletin I think you're kind of setting yourself up for that one if you're gonna kind of setting yourself up for that one if you're gonna post it somewhere open in the open where anybody who you're friends with or even anybody in general has access to that so\n\nYea\n\nI guess when it when it comes down to something like any of these situations you're posting everything on a public server which gives I mean plenty of people access to it it's not really it's not really anybody's server so you're school can't say like oh I don't know what I'm saying oh it's not like your server so if the school like goes and sees it they like you can't say oh but it's mine so \n\nYou invaded my privacy it's really someone else's and they have full access to that so like there was a situation one time in my high school someone he posted a blog online which he had a list of names and it was basically like a hit list that he was planning to carry out but he got caught someone searched his name on Google and found it found that site and yea that must have been scary for him but yea they reported it to the school and he got expelled\n\nYea.\n\nYea\n\nYea\n\nI think that's a big problem a big issue I mean the schools don't a lot of school officials don't tend to understand like what's the difference between someone expressing themselves and someone who's like actually plotting something in the background\n\nOh ok well they like to I don't know they like see someone dressed a certain way or something and they choose to progress and like kind of invade on their territory to try to figure out what's in their mind even though it could just be some like really nice person just\n\nYea\n\nIt's definitely getting more complicated because of um other situations like Columbine and all of that I mean that just after Columbine and several other school shootings, schools just started cracking down and with an iron fist and just kind of trying to root out all the possibilities trying to make sure it doesn't happen again I mean it's a good cause but sometimes they have to learn when they're going too far as opposed to when they're actually getting something done \n\nYea I think that's a big of an invasion of privacy\nI mean \n\nWhich one?\n\nOh yea because um I mean after Columbine you did there was an increase in school shootings and all of that like it's impossible to say that it I mean there were several that followed it people following in their footsteps I mean they definitely need to heighten the security but they don't need to go as far as they are going in some case where they take it to extremes like where they have like schools in lockdown so they can do locker searchers every every like week I mean that's just a bit that's just going overboard I think a little bit\n\nAnd I think imposing way too much security also like kind of like puts too much control over people I mean if someone feels like they're being oppressed they're probably going to act out against that so I think that sometimes it can actually worsen the situation and increase the risk of that actually happening\n\n\n\n",
        "See, I don't think we should have gone in, but I think pulling out now just pulling out and leaving nothing behind would be a big mistake. I mean look what happened in Haiti, look what happened in other situations where we've done that before and it's just been a disaster. I mean, I think just pulling out would hurt them even more than staying would.\n\nWell, the thing is also it's not just Bush it's the congress, it's the senate, it everything and a lot of people just think of it as being Bush they say, oh it's Bush, it's Bush but, he couldn't have gone in without getting the consent\n\nWell, I mean in going in I was talking about going in \n\nGoing in in general\n\nUh in the first place, he couldn't have gone in without them saying anything\n\nI don't know, I really don't think so. I don't think we're trying to put in the same democracy that we have here. We're trying to put in a government that works, and whatever that may be that's what it'll be it's just\n\nNo, it's not whatever works best for us I don't think I don't think so I think that we're trying to help them, it's not really about us.\n\nI can agree with that.\n\nWhat, two hundred years for it to at least settle down?\n\nOh, absolutely\n\nI think  a lot of the American people supported it also because it was right after 9-11. They were feeding off fear.\n\nIt's not It's not that I think it's good that's Saddam is out of power we went in for the wrong reasons though we went in by feeding off of the fear that the American people had after 9-11 after they hyped up that fear they immediately hyped up that fear it's the war on terror which is really not the war on terror it's not\n\nWell, it's like anywhere else. There's different kind of people. We just have to figure out how to get those groups to mix it's the same thing here I think but, to a smaller degree because we're a much bigger country um  and we can I don't why we can deal with it better I think it's because there's so many different cultures but these cultures have been there's three cultures within one culture that have been battling for years and we just have to figure out nobody's figured out a way we still don't know a way, but we have to figure it out somehow\n\nAbsolutely\n\nBut, I think without some outside help they're never gonna get to it because they've been at it for so long\n\nRight No, I agree I totally agree with you um  it's just how are we gonna do it? (cough) sorry how are we gonna do it? That's the problem now.\n\nBut, I still don't know if getting out just pulling out is a solution I don't think it is\n\nYeah, but it's not that simple that's the whole problem it's not that\n\nBut, a lot of the Americans you know not all of the American people they go with the media and the media is just like, oh another death in Iraq \n\nBut, that's not all of them though it's not even half it's just depends on the person's experience\n\nBut, can we trust the media we're getting? Because it's all spun. Even before it goes to political from that whichever station or whichever paper it is it's spun before that because it's spun by our government\n\nStatistics you can lie with very easily\n\nStill I'm not saying the numbers even it's just can we really trust exactly what the media is telling us in exactly the way the media spins it? No matter how impartial we want to be, it's gonna taint us. It's gonna taint our opinions of it.\n\nYeah, well personally I don't know does anyone read the international papers? Like I read papers \n\nI watch BBC all the time like that's where that's where I get my news I don't read the New York Times anymore I've given up I've given up on the U.S.'s newspapers because you never know you never know which political party, which person's opinion you're getting it's a little less impartial than an outside view so can we really be take what they're saying and without taking it with a really huge grain of salt?\n\nI think the main thing is we don't have any better ideas right now we don't we don't know what to do because it's a situation that's happened before and nobody's been able to fix it yet so this is what\n\nYou don't think well not the exact same situation I mean the situation with trying to fix war and culture in countries that have been warring for centuries\n\nWe had the same thing happening in Israel, and the same thing happening in \n\nThat's happened numerous times.\n\nWell, we know history we know we don't learn from history\nSometimes, I think history is gonna come up behind people and just hit people with a bat and just, listen to what I tell you sorry it's just we don't have any better ideas we don't know what to do, and I don't think really anybody has any better ideas yet it's either say or pull out there's kind of no even no middle ground\n\nI don't know.\n\nI don't agree.\n\nNo, I absolutely agree with the fact that there shouldn't be people who can't order a beer in the states, but they can go die for their country but that's different that's totally different they're too young to be fighting for their country\n\nMagnet schools?\n\nVocational schools?\n\nThree three? I think it's three.\n\nUmm, but here's  my problem. Just ok you think if we really pull out that there just gonna fight with each other? Because they all have very strong views against a lot of people in have strong views against western culture, so you really think it's just gonna stay with them fighting within their own cultures or it's gonna spread because I don't think it's gonna stay within their own cultures I think they're it's going to become a problem it's going to grow\n\nI think it's gonna spread, I think it's gonna they're gonna kind of I don't have I'm not articulating well\n\nBut, here's the thing almost everybody has nuclear weapons now, right?\n\nOne crackpot's gonna they have them we know they have them\n\nApparently we don't know because we have no idea where they could be hidden they could be hidden in other countries we really don't know this is just this isn't something that's in stone this isn't something that's I'm just saying in general they're just pulling out is gonna cause more problems just leaving is gonna cause more problems than if we had never gone in, in the first place\n\nNo, I agree\n\nYeah\n\nHaiti they pulled out and look what happened it fell into complete anarchy\n\nBut, it's the same kind of issue and the pulling out we didn't stay with it and we caused more problems by leaving by being there and then just not being there we caused more problems\n\nBut, everyone makes mistakes no one's perfect. No government is perfect.\n\nEverybody makes a lot of them. Look at history. I mean, come on.\n\nWell, when you say gradual, what do you mean? Like over the next ten years? Over the next fifteen years?\n\nSo, are you saying complete pull out with no one there, no bases, no nothing?\n\nEverybody has embassies.\n\nWell, when people say pull out they usually mean think completely\n\nI think, I agree with you in that we need to stick with it we can't just it seems like giving up on people if we just leave it seems like we're saying, it's not gonna happen, it's not gonna work so we're just gonna leave and give up\n\nWell, I think almost \n\nWell, what you just said also just made me think of something it made me think, this is the problem we have with the two party system there's no middle area it's either stay or go out it's not it's stay for a while or go out now there's no middle ground\n\nNo, but you can do gradual but she I agree with what you're saying they're saying, now get out now there's not gradual, there's no\n\nIt's now, they want them out now.\n\nUm it happened in Vietnam. Why wouldn't it happen again?\n\nAnd we know that people don't learn from their mistakes.\n\nYou can compare it because it's \n\nIs it a war?\n\nWas it a war?\n\nBut, they're calling it the war on terror so, it is a war even thought it hasn't been declared\n\nBut, you know what? It's not necessarily poor. It's just it's a process it's just the beginning of it not every experiment's gonna show not even experiment experiment's the wrong word not everything that's gonna happen is gonna show results automatically, right away and when it comes to terms of countries and change three years, four years, five years, is nothing it's no time\n\nThere's also the fear that they're closer to it than they are than we are they came it can become a home war for them\n\nIt absolutely could.\n\nYou'd be surprised at what the people I personally have my family lives over there that's\n\nYou'd be surprised at what you hear from the people not the governments the people\n\nThat's their fear.\n\nBut, there's also the different governments in Paris which actually subsidize the poor you can get a house for free same thing in Germany and France and in Italy if you're poor, you can get a house they'll give you one it's just different governments so I don't know if we can really compare their opinions to our opinions because it is different it's completely different form of government\n\nOh, absolutely.\n\nIt never really functioned very well. The idea was nice.\n\nI'm still not saying we should have gone in. I agree with you, we shouldn't have gone in.\n\nI mean great it's great that Saddam is out of power because he was you know a murderer just in the simplest sense of the word he was a murderer\n\nI don't know.\n\nBut, the thing is it was a structure that was based on killing he was killing anyone that decided to [inaudible] him so\n \nNo, I agree. I'm just saying in general, I'm glad that he's out of power. Maybe, we didn't go about it the right way we definitely didn't go about it the right way, but he's out of power and that is a good thing\n\nAbsolutely no absolutely I don't think we went in for the right reasons that's what I'm saying\n\nWe did not go in for the right reasons.\n\nWhat?\n\nNo, I agree. I agree. Um and I think there's definitely when it comes to people's when polled it's all black and white and it's not because\nNo, I know. I mean it's that's the problem the majority of America listens to what they're\n\nWell, it's absolutely it doesn't though it doesn't work that way\n\nBut, I mean I think there's definitely a I think part of this is because there's such a big population of people who live in a certain kind of area and a certain kind of mindset because our country's so big everyone's so spread out, and then there's that you have the coasts that are really densely populated, and then in the middle it's all kind of rural very rural, very few cities and there's a certain kind of mindset, and that is who rules our country almost that's who that the majority of votes are in the Midwest region\n\nMath and science.\n \nDo you think we went in for the right reasons?\n\nWell, first we were in Afghanistan then somehow we ended up in Iraq.\n\nSee, this is the see, this is the problem with that\n\nWe can't blame any single person. We can't we can't blame one person which it's just not possible because it just doesn't work that's not the way our government functions\n\nI can see that, but I don't think it's his\n\nYou can, but I don't think it's his driving force I would personally think about it if you went if his father was president and then you became president you'd want to separate yourself from him not be him\n\nWhich was its aim.\n\nI mean, there's good things that came from this war in the fact that Saddam Hussein is out of power right that is a good thing are we kinda like that's not\n\nDictator gone people not getting slaughtered because they believe in a different they worship a god a different way good thing you know but then they we're still at war for reasons that we shouldn't be, but I'm still standing by the fact that we can't until there's a better idea until there's a better plan, we can't just leave we can't just leave it the way it is because that's a cop out it's just leaving it's giving up on people and I don't know I'm a humanist I believe that all people are generally good, and there's some way we can do this it can be done \n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "I think  that would help the separation of church and state  I don't see anything wrong with  um  making a new  name for marriage  as long as it like you said  applies to all marriages  heterosexual and homosexual  and  has the same rights  conferred with it  as a marriage license\n\nYea\n\nYea  I don't think it should be  able to be argued as a religious matter  in a political arena  like in  campaign platforms or whatever  politicians shouldn't be  allowed to use a religious argument\n\nI have no idea  all I've heard is  the religious argument  where a man and man  yea\n\nYea\n\nI think it really does  cause  I mean  that's  that's where science comes in  is doing studies of like  homosexual versus heterosexual couples  and the way they function  in neighborhoods and in raising children  and  so far  I mean  from what I've seen  no significant difference has been found at all  I mean  there's dysfunctional couples on both sides  and there's couples who are gonna get divorced and  abuse their children  but  statistically  you have the same chances  either way\n\nRight  cause they're already living together  most of the time so\\\n\nRight  and I mean  they should be  they should be able to get like tax breaks if they're gonna be living together anyhow  and like functioning as a  family\n\nThat's true.\n\nThey shouldn't  but I'm sure they will\n\nIf they're just trying to get the vote\n\nAnd  it's just  it's an easy appeal to people's emotions  to bring religion into voting\n\nYea  but I mean  that's what gets them out in mass\n\nThat's what makes people vote  is something challenging  like  a belief system  or  something they disagree with\n\nUh-huh\n\nYea\n\nUh-huh  I think there needs to be  some  sort  of  wider consensus on it  cause then with that  you have the issue of  people getting married in one place and it not being legally recognized  like if they move to another city\n\nSo  right\n\nYea.\n\nYea  but I mean  at this point  it could go one way or the other  right now  cause  there's  Bush has already got his amendment up there  he's trying to pass  banning gay marriage\n\nYea  I know  still  I mean \n\nReligion sin\n\nThat's  that's \n\nNo\n\nHe still had a lot of support  I mean  I don't think something like that would ever happen  but  I think  if  the Supreme Court accepted this issue right now  it would be  I don't know  a lot of people would be unhappy either way \n\nYea   pretty much\n\nNo\n\nYea  I think the only thing detrimental is  to them is  how  other people might view them  like as a family\n\nAnd how what they might encounter growing up  but \n\nRight  if they have a secure home life\n\nRight\n\nRight \n\nThat's true\n\nWow\n\nSo wait  is it  according to the  Catholic Church  is it ok to be homosexual  as long as you don't act on it?\n\nOk\n\nWell  yea\n\nYea\n\nOh man\n\nYea\n\nYea  right \n\nI mean  I'm sure some people who have like the gene for it or whatever  because of their home life and their childhood  grow up never expressing it\n\nAnd not even  like  considering it\n\nJust\n\nI don't know\n\nYea  \n\nOh  Troy?\n\nYea  didn't like\n\nThank you Brad Pitt \n\nYea\n\nDidn't they used to like only have sex with women when they wanted children?\n\nAnd in Rome  the men were like for pleasure\n\nYea\n\nYea \n\nReally?\n\nYea\n\nYea  which makes sense  living in a patriarchal society  like that  I guess\nThings have changed a lot \n\nWhat  what do people think happens to these kids that are adopted by gay families  do they think they're brainwashed into becoming gay?

        "I feel like even if we're there where every single law they could ever possibly cover where everything had to be equal you weren't allowed to discriminate there would still be people who thought that so I mean you really I feel like I agree with you that there's been a lot especially with the equal pay laws where you're not allowed to pay a woman less or even the man less I guess depending on the business they're not allowed to pay you for something less pay a person less for the same job all those kind of things they've really evened it out a lot\n\nThe better, more skilled for the job\n\nRight I mean\n\nRight, and its reverse discrimination too because in that case it's like no men here.\n\nYeah, we're quick to jump to that, but maybe you don't get the job and you come home and you're mad and it's like it's because I'm a woman! but like it might not be you might not have been good at the job [laughter] like it's just as easy it could be something like that I agree with you\n\nYeah, it could be based on your personality it could be based on anything\n\nThere's still more that needs to be done. I mean we've gotten away from the women stay home and take care of the kids idea of the past but there is still things that need to be done and I mean that and it's kinda funny now too because men are actually discriminated against when they want to stay home and take care of the kids because then it's like your wife makes all the money [laughter] and those kind of things whereas and there's nothing wrong with that either there's no reason you can't be like a Mr. Mom they call it but you know but\n\nNo, I definitely agree with that, but I don't see the difference between a mother and a father whereas\n\nLife if I mean there are some differences a woman is you know probably gonna but a woman is known to be more nurturing and like those kind of things but there's no reason a father couldn't do it and there's no reason a father couldn't be a stay at home dad but I agree with you when the kids are just dropped off and left somewhere it doesn't always work out as well but um in the case of whether you're mom or dad is taking care of you when you're at home it doesn't seem to be much of a difference\n\nRight, and for most construction jobs they'll take a big man over like me [laughter] \n\nOh, yeah\n\nOh yeah and I do I do agree that the point I was trying to make with that is like there's not I mean besides the whole fact of how you think you're kids should be raised there's nothing wrong with the father not making the money like they always say like in like Leave It to Beaver when the dad comes home from work and the mom has the apron on and she's making dinner like we've just come so far from that whereas even now like the mom and the dad go to work in the morning and then they come home around the same time and then sure the mom cooks dinner but like she but she also went to work all day and it's we're away from that where it had to be like the woman wasn't allowed to work whereas now, if she chooses not to, that's fine but, you don't have to stay at home\n\nExactly, that's true also.\n\nYeah I mean I guess relationships in general like in that sense\n\nRight, whereas a woman sits and it's like oh that's so nice she's s housewife no, I agree with that and that's where the discrimination part comes in because you look and you're like wait you couldn't get a job anywhere? but it's like no, I wanted to stay home with my kids\nOh definitely\n\nYeah, my aunt is the CEO of a company and my uncle does have a job, but it's not making nearly as much as she is and I mean as long as they're Ok with that you're not gonna have her be like no you have to stay home so I can work here at McDonald's [laughter] like you're not gonna make that decision\n\nIt would be pretty interesting to see when I mean even when there are kinds of homes they're a lot less traditional but even now when we become parents and when we're older it's gonna be kind of funny because you could like cause now whereas I'm sure your parents didn't go to a lot of dinner parties with like their two lesbian friends or like things like that or whereas it might be with every generation it gets more and more so I mean maybe like maybe you are gonna make a lot more money than your husband you know like that kinda thing whereas I feel like it's gonna be like a lot less traditional as we get older and as the generations keep cause I mean even the world we grew up in was a lot different than our parents\n\nNo, I agree. I did the same kind of thing where my mom worked and then she had kids and stayed home for the entire eighteen years that I was a kid, and now she's working. But and it's the same kind of thing where I would never want to that's the same way I would want to do it I would want to raise my kids I don't want to watch them be raised I would like to raise them so I wouldn't I don't like that people look at me like, really you don't work? where it should be ok\nAnd it's just not going to be reached they need a realistic goal\n\nIt's never gonna be completely \n \nThat's even the same if you ever like gotten into a fight with someone of the opposite sex like you have two completely different views on everything, and at first you're like why do you always disagree with me? But like it's just really where like two completely different I mean we use different parts of our brain even and some of the smaller parts of our brain obviously we use some of the same parts, but there are like little chemical differences where like we use a part of our brain that you don't and you use a part of your brain that we don't so like you need you can't be completely the same we're not at all\n\nMaybe engineering the classes here there's like thirty people and it's like 27 boys and 3 girls\n\nAnd no one's forcing them anyone who walks in here can be an engineer, but there's mostly men in that what do you think would be different if there was a woman president? Mot necessarily Hilary because I know that's a whole different issue but like a woman president\n \nIn these countries women have no power\n\nYeah, they're not even allowed \n\nYeah I mean you can't even see their face you can't there's all those kinds of things and then all of a sudden there's this woman who's this public figurehead of American basically\n\nNo, I know what you're saying, and I think it's something like even as much as we're saying the other countries may not be ready for it as much as there's a large part of our country that's not ready for it\n\nI mean we'd have people rebelling all over the place [laughter] I mean like I'm not gonna follow that law, she made it and be like really juvenile about it but I mean like I don't think we have enough of our country that's ready for it\n\nI mean women have come a long way, and like they're even I mean women are in high power and there are a lot of things there are companies run by women ya know there are all those kind of things but a country, I'm like not so sure\n\nAnd then it also becomes whereas like a male president is more of they say, they feel, they act how they are I mean obviously you're taking into account a lot of things, but for a woman it would almost be that other layer of now I'm going to have to think about they're going to say just because I'm a woman that I said that and you'd have to like have that whole aspect in there\n\nRight I mean if she if and even in this case like Hilary if she doesn't win it's not gonna be I mean that's the way the country's feeling at this point\n\nIncluding women too  I mean it's not we're way past where only men can vote like it's [laughter] it's gonna be women I mean if she loses, it's going to be that women didn't want her either it's not just going to be the men\n\nI mean even if we even if we just saw\n\nI don't want to see it now I mean I'd love to see it sometime when we were all ready for it but we're I don't know I don't want to see it yet\n\nI think we might need a different candidate to consider.\n\nWe can't I mean \n\nCause it's enough of a change to change from one white, male president to another white, male president that's like a huge change like we're gonna see it when it does change it's gonna be ridiculous when everything changes cause who knows if they agree with exactly everything that the last president agreed with and then trying to throw in another factor and I mean as much as we're even and this goes back to gender discrimination in any sense too like we said no matter what, no matter how you think you've changed everything you can possibly change there's gonna be that guy or that girl who says, no they can't do it because they're a woman or they can't do it because they're black or they can't anything like that there's going to be people no matter you can try and brain wash everyone in the country there's gonna be people who still don't believe it\nRight, and you're allowed and like we're actually as long as we don't act violently against it you're allowed to think what you want you're allowed to say what you want so in a country like this it would be hard I'm sure in certain countries that have like oppression and things like that it's they might think it, but they wouldn't say it and they're not acting out about it but here there's nothing really holding us back from saying, she did that because she's a woman ya know? or anything like that so it would be hard to get past that\n\nOh definitely it's been there's been so much change so many changes and obviously all these have cause we talk about most of them there's been so many changes within the past even fifty years that it's like amazing the amount of change that can occur in such a little bit of time but even with all the change, I still don't think this is something that shouldn't be happening yet\n\nNow, wait a minute, why don't we vote? like\n\nOn certain issues\n\nThere's still some things that they could be\n\nOf course but even now even just the one issue that seems to be like really prevalent of abortion where like I know some people are definitely taking it too far some people not taking it far enough and fine but it's an issue and kind of there is no decision about yet so until there is like that's the kind of issue where I believe the feminist issue has kind of went a little too far on a lot of things but there are some current issues that kind of they have opinions and it's enough of an opinion that needs to be voiced and this is a decision they just I don't honestly know what it is, but they just made a ruling about abortion, and I can't tell you what it is because I forgot but this is something abortion is something that's being changed as we speak right now like there are people arguing it right now so those kinds of issues you do have to be fighting for but there are a lot of things I think they can stop with or not begin with but I mean even there are things that are going on right now\n\nAnd that's where it becomes different too because what it should be is not I hate all males so give me what I want it should just be give me what I want [laughter] and it should just be kind of I'm fighting for women not fighting for being against men for women just fighting for women I agree um people need to stop on that one too\n\nI feel like as much as it was as issue in the beginning because every time a woman opened her mouth she'd be put in jail even from when they were trying to get the right to vote and they'd all be put in jail so it's the kind of thing where they're I understand that being the alpha male but I don't personally I don't think there's a lot of people now who are feeling that like I don't feel oppressed right now I'm ok you know like those kind of things like I don't feel like that so I think it could be lessened in the fact that yes it was men were very pushy in the beginning, but we don't need to necessarily think that way exactly right now\n\nOh yeah it's definitely not just a woman's fight especially for abortion\n\nRight and I don't I mean as in changing what we think is different a lot of it is the person that'll come along you're not allowed to think bad things about women because that's not that's never you know gonna be effective so and there's no I can't see besides and even these this whole like abortion issue which is a big issue now is not necessarily a gender discrimination issue it's not like men are allowed to get abortions and women aren't ya know not like that kind of thing\n\nSo, it's not as much as that is an issue that directly involved on gender it's not necessarily a gender discrimination issue so I don't know if\n\nExactly, so I don't know if there are actually any big gender discrimination issues cause like you said people are gonna say people are gonna say forever if you are not allowed to gender discriminate people are gonna be like I was not allowed to do that because I am a woman you know it's gonna happen so there are not really any set laws you can make right now, I don't think\n\nI mean it's not nearly as prevalent and again all of these issues now it's not the gender discrimination of the past where it was women can't vote or you know women have to stay home those kinds of things but I mean now I think that as a gender men kinda get put off as like they get called like certain names now like you're like a pig you know, all those kind of things but all of those are still opinions so I really don't know if there's a lot of like \n",
        "[Inaudible]\n\nIt's ok.\n\nI think even the structure of the Catholic Church has become outdated and I think that's one of the most important problems it's facing right now because it's still kind of based on this paternalistic structure and it still has that same hierarchy that's been entrenched for G-d knows how many centuries\n\nUm and I think that's become a problem for it because it's because of that it's very insolated the hierarchy and it's no longer really responsive to even like the ideas and concerns of ordinary Catholics like a lot of American Catholics feel the same way you do\n\nBut they can't do anything about it because it's not like they have a vote or anybody besides somebody who's been to the seminary has worked their way up through the ranks has a say\n\nThat will go on anywhere everywhere not just the church\n\nAt the beginning when they first like Catholic priests were not celibate to begin with when the church was first founded that was a very pragmatic decision they made because priests started having children bequeathing church lands to their children when they died and that was causing and that was causing that was causing financial problems for the church so they instituted celibacy and I mean when you look at it kind of from that perspective it wasn't even really instituted as a spiritual thing to begin with \n\nSo why is it still around so it's not like they couldn't control that now if they wanted to\n\nNo there are a lot of eastern religions that advocate celibacy\n\nYea I mean and it's not like you there are a handful of married Catholic priests around the country and the way to do it is to become an Episcopalian priest first \n\nBecause the theologies are so similar and then decide to want to convert and they'll let you keep your wife\n\nYea\n\nThere are a lot of small sects of Christianity I mean I don't think we could list them all even if we were out here thinking about it for a while\n\nIf you really want to be a Catholic priest and you really want to get married I guess that's the way to go\n\nIt's not very common at all like I said it's like \n\nWell I mean the theologies are so similar though like you said it's just a few minor differences here and there like \n\nI actually have an uncle who's a Catholic Priest.\n\nYea.\n\nHe obviously he wasn't happy about it but um he did get a lot negative reactions cause most priests wear around like the Roman collar and the black all the time when they're out like going even doing like shopping or stuff like that and people would walk up to him and call him a pedophile\n\nAnd that just wasn't the case but I mean that's the mindset people get just from the repeated news stories\n\nI mean it really was an epidemic what was happening it wasn't like this wasn't something that was happening in the Catholic Church but it's not all over the Catholic Church ya know?\n\nWell I don't know how like just because you're a pedophile doesn't necessarily mean that you're gay it's just an outlet for repressed sexuality essentially and the priests don't have anywhere to go to express their sexuality and\n\nI'm not saying that it wouldn't be a problem at all anymore but I think that would be significantly reduced as a problem because the cases here about where like a married couple where the husband's a pedophile I think that's slightly different from the type of pedophilia that was happening in the Catholic Church\n\nI think the other problem with the pedophilia that the pedophilia epidemic exposed was that because the Catholic Church is so insolated they're having a real crisis in terms of getting new priests and because of that they don't have people to staff the parishes and they want to keep the priests they have so even if someone is a pedophile you would see the archbishops and bishops would just move them from parish to parish whenever cases popped up instead of reporting them and I mean that's a big issue and I think that they would be more likely to get new priests and they would actually conceivably be able to fire old ones if they needed to if they had new blood coming in\n\nAnd I think that would be more likely to happen if priests had the opportunity to get married it would be more of an attractive prospective to a lot of people a lot of people I know would be more likely to be priests if they could get married\n\nNo\n\nI think that because of the the structure of the Catholic Church they're just a naturally conservative institution\n\nYea\nThe rape scene\n\nAbout?\n\nHe has a very liberal mindset as far as most priests go and he's been told my the bishop of our diocese to stay quiet several times so he tends to not express his opinions out loud about things like that\n\nBut he's like but there have been cases where he's given communion to people who aren't technically Catholic which you aren't supposed to do and things like that and he's administered certain sacraments to non-Catholics\n\nSo he's kind of riding a fence\n\nWell a lot of people will talk to it's happened a couple of times at weddings and funerals and stuff like that where like the family will talk to him before hand and say hey so and so isn't Catholic, is it ok if they receive? And he'll just say yes\n\nI'm sure that that happens too\n\nUh-huh\n\nI think it works better for certain people\n\nAnd for certain personality types like if that just doesn't work for you personality ya know?\n\nKind of at about the same place.\n\nUh-huh kind of I don't really know to be honest\n\nI was raised in a very, very Catholic family \n\nLike we were strict Irish-Catholics growing up I have an uncle who's a priest my dad is a principal of a Catholic grade school so it's not like and I was an alter boy until I was like um a junior in high school so it's not like I wasn't exposed to it for a very long time\n\nUh-huh\n\nMy grandmother used to go everyday up until she died\n\nIt's easy to be religious when you're about 13 or 14 \n \n\n\nUm I don't know I think yes the Catholic Church does need to change if they intend to survive long-term but I don't know that they will \n\n\n",
        "Yea I pretty much completely agree with that I was gonna use the same example of the glass ceiling like you can look up and see people above you but you just can't get there and I think that it just it doesn't make sense to me how two people a male and a female are doing performing the exact same duties that the male should get paid more but like it's studies have shown that that does happen \n\nIf I can go back to what you were saying about um Hilary Clinton and a female president I think that besides the fact that I don't think that she would win um I don't even know if the world would be ready for us to have a female president I mean if you think like the Arab nations where there's so much more discrimination against women I mean I don't know if our country would be like if other countries would respect a female president the way they would respect a male\n\nI Agree\n\nThere actually like was one person I don't know here name\n\nShe like died recently \n\nShe was like she was actually a black woman to and a lot of people liked her I don't know remember what [inaudible] I don't know I guess I don't know what I was going to say\n\nI agree with that I don't know it's like harder for us to comprehend just because we have so different culture-wise but I guess if we studied as to why they feel it's empowering then it's easier to understand and also you just have to look at their climate cause I'm sure like the origins of it had to do with like the winds in the summer \n\nYea, I would think that that'd be interesting because I guess part of the reason we have this whole glass ceiling is because historically businesses were dominated by men and it's just ya know relatively recently like I don't know however um past couple of decades that women are starting to take on more leadership roles that ya know it's gonna take time to balance that out \n\nI agree with that[Inaudible]\n\nI think that we just kinda said I don't know if it can really be change.  I mean I guess it can be improved somewhat I mean we were saying before how ya know as more women come out of college and maybe go into business positions or into other fields and maybe gain like some top positions there I mean it might change a little bit just as we see more women working I don't know if it will ever fully change.\n\nYea I agree because like I mean even if you think like how I know there's not like a draft now but when there was a draft ya know it was only males that were drafted like I wouldn't want for there to be females to be drafted like I wouldn't have any desire like ya know some like law enforcement like police officers or firemen like there tend to be more that tends to be more male dominated but I kinda think that just because of physical differences it makes more sense for those to be male dominated fields and I don't really have anything against that\n\nThat's a good point.\n\nIt is an anatomical difference I mean I'm not trying to put words into your mouth but what I was getting from what you were saying was that if you're born with like you're born as a male but you feel that you should be a female like what is that that you're feeling that gender like I don't know that I guess that there must be some other difference besides just the physical difference.\n\nI mean this is something really random but um I was trying to think of ways in which like men would be discriminated against versus women and I was thinking that if I don't know you had a man who wanted to be like a preschool teacher not that he couldn't but it would be a little weird like you might think that they're some like \n\nYea\n\nYea so like I don't know I guess that was just another example \n\nUh-huh. Yea.\n\nAt the same time though you have to think that that person is going to be kinda messed up growing up like not knowing like like when they're a little kid though what do you\n\nDo they have like a short haircut or like what? Like I don't know. It doesn't make sense to me.\n\nCause then like they \n\nBut then if they just like randomly change like what are you in sixth grade or so when you're twelve and then the other kids in your class [laughter] are going to tease you so badly Like if you were a boy and now you're a girl? And you're twelve?\n",
        "Ok [Laughter]\n\nUm I guess I feel like the Catholic Church does cause I'm Episcopalian so it's like a branched off it's like the same thing but there's a couple like variations to it and I feel like they do because the fact that I feel like the bible and the like many of the teachings were based on like it's like simple black and white things and our 21st century everything is just I'm I'm a grey person there's not a direct answer to everything except for some things yes but everything mostly in my life right now is grey like I wanted like there's yes but then there's no and so I'll try out both things and I feel like the Catholic Church doesn't allow for that they don't allow for different circumstances they say no to abortion, no to homosexuality no to this, no to that and that's not allowing people to figure out things and ya know ya know change their ways and anything because all they have is this strict yes and no that's not hm don't like that\n\nYea\n\nYea [Inaudible]\n\nUh-huh\n\nYea [Laughter]\n\nYea I mean cause I feel like\n\nThey are black and white.\n\nYea well I don't follow them\n\nHm?\n\nYea it is cause there's like the Catholic Church has a pope and there's like this whole Virgin Mary thing and Episcopalians don't have a everyone's a Bishop and not they don't have a high person up there\n\nAnd we don't we only talk about the Virgin Mary on um Christmas \n\nAnd some other day but I'm not a big I don't do Episcopalian things cause they don't they just really like their sermons I feel like when you have a sermon or a homily it's supposed to touch everyone and their homilies are so dry and for an hour you can have a really good nap during that sermon\n\nUh-huh very religious I just don't I like cause I went to Johns Hopkins I'm in the Gospel Choir here and I went to Johns Hopkins and they had this Gospel Jubilee and it was like a really big Baptist thing and everybody was just talking and I was like it actually I'd never been spiritually moved and that was a time I was like crying because I had so much in my heart and I was like that was that had me spiritually moved and I like I realized a lot about G-d like during that time but I feel like with the Catholic and Episcopalian things it's like the like here's here are you and here's G-d up here and then when you're a Baptist it's like kind of like this and that's how I view it I feel like G-d is like a friend and not so much as like this higher authority he knows everything and that which makes it a little bit higher than you but he's not so much as to just be like this overbearing, dominant, domineering person \n\nYea\n\nYea that's how I think about it\n\nYea\n\nYea\n\nYea\n\nTheses\n\nUh-huh\n\nExactly yes.\n\nBecause I feel like they just ok I kind of forgot what you said that I said yes to but the whole what did you say? It was like\n\nYea the repression of emotions like that's that's what I was talking about like the Bible's like here's this and here's yes and here's no and then like and as like especially as a teenager and as like a coming adult there are so many things that you just you're questioning and you're wondering and then here you have the Bible is like no you can't go out and smoke, you can't go out and just try and have a casual relationship with someone, you can't go out and have sex, you can't go out and do this and it's like that's the human emotion to go out and to try and to do and they're like suppressing that and that's why you have probably Catholic priests who're doing the whole pedophile thing because they're like they're so like ya know it's so like refrained and like restricted from being a total human because they have to I mean unless of course there are some people who are spiritually guided into it ya know and they're spiritually it's spiritually there for them to feel all of this and ya know do the whole celibate thing go for it but [Laughter] \n\nTrue\n\nYea and I feel like if it was like it didn't it wouldn't have mattered if like cause if Episcopalians you're allowed to get have um to be married as a priest and so if it were to happen in that way then they'd have been like well ok but because it's a rule and because as a Catholic priest they say dedicate your whole life to Jesus then it's like that includes the sexuality part so that's why it's like it's clashing ya know everyone's like ya know Catholic's Catholic priests are these pedophiles because there's a rule against it and I feel like if there wasn't a rule then people wouldn't care as much\n\nThey wouldn't it wouldn't be they would care if they were pedophiles but it wouldn't be like this big Catholic priests are bad thing and don't get too close to Catholic priests type thing if it if there wasn't like a big strict rule about cause isn't like Catholic isn't like Catholicism the only thing the only religion that allows for priests not to be married is that the only one?\n\nOh ok but I mean on this side\n\nYea \n\nAnd then\n\n[Laughter] Yea \n\nUh-huh\n\nThere's Evangelist um Baptist and\n\nYea what did I say?\n\nDid you say Evangelical? \n\nYea\n\nYea\n\nI think it's wrong though\n\nI think it's wrong though cause it's like you're using another religion to get \n\nLike to better yourself that's wrong ya know  \n\nYea\n\nYea\n\nMy elementary school had a case of there was like it opened in 1960 something and my elementary school like um had a couple of pedophiles\n\nUh-huh I was I was in eighth grade when I one day [Laughter] I'm like and I looked cause my teacher always got the paper and then I saw cause I went to a school called St. Columba and it was like, St. Columba pedophiles and I was like, Whoa [Laughter] and I was like and I had everyone reading it and like two minutes it was fun but I didn't really figure out like the depth behind it because I was in eighth grade so\n\nNo\n\nBut that's like that's like the same thing we were talking about it's like a ya know just those cases but I feel like the alter boys or who they do the pedophiles with is like they're there all the time like because I know I used to be a acolyte up at my church and they I was there like every Saturday I was there for Wednesdays for Gospel Choir for like rehearsals I was there all the time and so with that it's like they see it all the time and you have intimate I mean me and my priest used to sit down and just like talk and then sit down and discuss things that were going on in my life and then I was like the senior acolyte so I had to be there a lot more than anybody else had to do because I was a senior acolyte I was the mistress of ceremonies so I had to like see out the whole mass so I was there a lot so it's easy if he had a wife they wouldn't have those urges or a wife or anyone else they'd want do anything with\n\nYea\n\nYea it wouldn't be I don't know how they do that \n\nYea I do \n\nAnd then like changing that would mean like there'd be like a cascade like changing that would mean changing something else and changing something else and I mean if it was something like really new it would be a lot easier but because Catholicism has been there for like\n\nYea pretty much ya know it'll be really hard to change that and \n\nYea\n\nThey don't have as much media as we do\n\nYea \n\nYea\n\nThat's scary\n\nI think people are just scared of seeing like they said the same thing about Passion of the Christ everybody had their big old uproar about actually seeing I mean when I saw it it like had me I was like oh my gosh it's nothing nothing's like reading the Bible and then actually seeing that\n\nThat was oh that movie was crazy but I just feel like \n\nIt's harder it's easier for people to not say anything when they don't see it and ya know it's as soon as people see it they're like whoa wait a minute ya know \n\nReally? He shouldn't have.\n\nYea \n\nThat's what I was talking about they shouldn't have the suppress anything ya know I feel like church is about ministering to everyone and to ya know you shouldn't I feel like sometimes with like the whole Catholic thing it's like if you're not Catholic then like no\n\nAnd that's like the part that's that's why Catholics I think are put like on this side and then you have everyone else because everyone else is like well we accept you no matter what ya know you may not be the same religion but at least come and hear what we have to say but Catholics are like you can't receive communion until you're this age you can't do this until you're this age and it's just too many rules I'm not a big rule person\n\nYou do?\n\nYea\n\nYea I'm a rule bender I don't do rules \n\nWhat does that mean? \n\nThat's cool so you should be allowed to [inaudible]\n\nYou're a Catholic?\n\nI was like yea she is\n\nYea so was I\n\nI'm really I was like it was really ironic for me cause I went to I've been in Catholic school since I was in kindergarten and but yet I'm Episcopalian so that's why I'm like I can see both sides of everything I just I'm not I really I was I was at a point in time when I was in like eighth grade and ninth grade I was like ya know what why don't I just be baptized Catholic I'm there all the time might as well be and then puberty hit and I was like oh no \n\nYea it is really easy cause you don't question anything you're like they say this, they say this\n\nYea and then you hit 16 and you're like wait a minute what I don't think I think this\n\nLike I don't know let me think about that\nYea I don't know I don't even remember I just I was I used to be really devout I was like ya know no abortion I think abortion is wrong I think there are so many other options to abortion and then I got I had friends and I was like it is way too hard to just make a decision based on that and based on ya know some people like I just took it like one day I was like ya know what what would happen if I got raped? Would I sit there and just have the kid? And I was like I don't think I can cause I'm a big I'm a mother person and so I can't like not that I want to get pregnant now but when I would get pregnant it's gonna be like the happiest experience of my life and I'm I don't feel like if I have that baby if I was with that baby for 9 months I feel like I'm gonna get attached to it and so I would like I couldn't even do um like an adoption like even if I got pregnant now well school's gonna be done cause I'll go back at another time cause I couldn't I couldn't watch my child go off with someone else ya know I don't know so I just kinda after a while I was like I kinda heard other people's opinions about abortion and I kinda I would go in and be like no abortion, no abortion and then people would be like who are you to say that and then and got got into like a lot of really in depth conversations and it kind of changed my views on it so that's [inaudible] \n\nUntil you get into that situation\n\nYea\n\nYea\n\nYea\n\nThat other person\n\nAnd abortions are so expensive like nowadays you can't just well is well is it expensive or is it free? \n\nPretty much\n\nCause I think I cause I was just going on basis of like movies and stuff that I've seen that it costs like 4 or 500 dollars I was like\n\nBut I think I'd rather but then that leads into people who know they can't come up 500 dollars and then they go off and they throw themselves down a like steps and get a miscarriage\n\nThey go to someone's house and they do it?\n\nYea I'm a bio major that's disgusting\n\nYou're not a devout Catholic well you're not like by the book Catholic\n\n[Inaudible]\n\nYea\n\nYea\n\nBut I had like a discussion with that like yesterday with my friend who was like I told him he's going through this thing where he just doesn't like trying to find himself and he's trying to find himself but also be like a devout Christian I'm like you gotta let it go ya know kind of find his cause he's like he doesn't want to go off and go smoking he doesn't want to go do this I'm like G-d will forgive you in the end and he was like well you know I don't want to take advantage of that\n\nI don't know I don't really know that I was like I never really heard about that I feel like it's something that's wrong ya know I feel like it's kind of like a sin cause you're in the end I mean as long as you're not like a chain smoker ya know that it kind of hurts your body in a way but do what you want it's your body but\n\nYea\n\nYea [inaudible] \n\nI feel like they make some of those things up just to give you something\n\nThey're not condoning any type of fun in your life\n\nNo deodorant or cleanliness\n\nYea but I think it's cool how the Amish they like have that time in which you turn 16 and you're able to go out but then it's like a big culture shock cause you're like I've know like I saw there was like an Amish show where they like came out and they kind of did everything and\n\nYea some of them had the choice to go back and some of them didn't and like some of them chose to stay there and I was like you can't do that for like 6 weeks and be like well what's your decision ya know like America and what we do now\n\nI don't even know if it was 6 weeks but it was like a 6 week show \n\nSo that's like I just don't feel like you can't you go to Amish country where you have no all you do is go to church and you go to school and you knit\n\nYea so [inaudible]\n\nSorry\n\nYea\nSorry\n\nI don't really\n\nYea cause I don't know\n\nBother to what? Change it? \n\nYea\n\nSorry and I feel like the um the like I just don't think they will change at that point because they it'll be like I feel like they have this stance like if we like outlast it and we ya know stick to what we say and all that type of stuff then maybe we'll end up winning in the end but it's kind of hard because if you think about this generation this generation is like an accepting generation or a tolerating generation and we're more people that we're like yes to ya know we may not like it but we're not gonna diss you on it we're not gonna kill you off of well there's some people but\n\n",
        "Well I think um Myspace is kind of like um known to be like public cause it's kinda of like a public forum I mean I don't know like the specifics of the Myspace posts, but I'm assuming that you could just go to any Myspace and type in slash whatever and just get information without having any prior qualification or having to belong to any kind of group or anything like that so I think it's legitimate to use that kind of information or for the [inaudible] like information off of that kinda page\n\nI think they still have to withhold or uphold um  like privacy concerns though like if it's a private group even though that information should stay on, you shouldn't have to worry that it can be accessed by anyone\n\nOn Myspace\n\nWell, again, that's like that's public information I mean that could be technically um classified as like slander couldn't it?\n\nI think you gotta realize thought that the internet's not the most secure place to put information. \n\nWell\n\nNo, that's ok. So, do you guys think that they should be able to use information that's like part of a private group type thing? Or\n\nI think they established that they're allowed to use that, right? Pictures and \n\nWell, possession of alcohol I guess.\n\nI mean you can never really tell anything from a picture just because it's like static like even if you're going like that you can just say you were spit it our after or it's water for the recorder, I was holding a beer can \n\nSay that again.\n\nHuh, that's interesting. Well, like Facebook, how would they access that?\n\nLook at this, rapist occupation\n \nWhat about if you work at a uh  brewry brew-er-ry that could be a conflict of interest with your job\n\nWhat if you're an alcoholic working at a brewery, and they you know looking into your personal life or whatever I mean that could effect your it's just an example I don't know \n\nI guess it would have to be some kind of action that warrants certain\n\nWhat do you guys think about uh the [inaudible] \n\nWell first of all, do you support it or?\n\nWell, I don't think it would be possible to for them to like a mainstream you know terrorists like where they go hang out\n\nI would support it as long as I can be guaranteed that that information won't be used for anything else besides catching terrorists. I mean otherwise, it's just like a total invasion of privacy.\n\nAs long as it does have that one purpose, I mean nothing bad can ever come\n\nAlso, I think that when somebody established those rights like they never imagined we could be in this kind of war where it could be you know any attack at any time and it's just so like internal all these insurgents all over the place\n\nWhy is it racial profiling? Because most of the calls they pick up are Middle Easter in origin or?\n\nOk\n\nOh, I got ya.\n\n",
        "I guess I'll begin.\n\nUm so what it's saying um the Roman Catholic Church has been longstanding like the example orthodox [inaudible] in the Christian religion and I don't know I feel like there are a lot of other religions or more progressive people there are a lot more like branches sects of Christianity for progressive people um and I personally would never become like Roman Catholic or anything but \n\num well personally I'm not really a religious person at all like I don't really believe in religion um but like as far as like the influence of the Roman Catholic Church like I mean I feel like within like a religion whether be like Christianity um Judaism um Islam I mean I think there should be dialogue between ya know those more fundamentalist groups and the more progressive groups and I I mean if you don't have that dialogue then like there's nothing like you can't move forward kinda you can't make decisions um I mean it's the same with like politics you have to have liberals and you have to have conservatives because if you don't like it's not going to work like I feel like that dialogue is necessary but at the same time the Roman Catholic Church is so influential over like Christianity and I mean just the world in general that I feel um I guess I do feel that either it has to be more progressive or like not like lose some of it's influence I guess \n\nAnd when I think um ya know the religious texts of any religion have to be understood in the context of their time period I mean I think the Catholic Church is probably doing a little better job at it then like let's say the more religiously fundamental Islam groups um who where like if you look inside the Koran you can find stuff about polygamy and um uh things like um like slavery and stuff that you can find in the Koran but the more fundamental groups are like refusing to like they feel like a critically analyzing a word of\nG-d should be forbidden so um I guess in that respect the Catholic Church is doing a somewhat better job of it also because um they don't believe the bible is the word like of G-d like the Muslims do so \n\nyea um like on a side note it's kinda related to that like just like as a religion in general like I don't feel that there should be like this kinda buffer this kinda like these people that are in between you and your relationship with G-d ya know people who say you have to do this you have to receive communion and from like I don't even know I'm not Catholic but ya know have all these people who tell you what to believe and like I don't know they're just coming in between you and G-d and I just don't feel that's\n\nwell I mean and I don't have a problem with that um if ya know people are free to believe whatever they way \n\nbut I mean I guess my problem comes with the amount of influence that the Catholic Church has um I mean you look at the Catholic Church versus the world council of churches and like um the influence of the Catholic Church is much greater and it's growing like \n \nwell true but\n\nalthough it has been like growing exponentially like now in regions that for ya know Christianity wasn't like especially in like Latin America and Africa right now I mean the Catholic Church is kinda gaining a I guess a monopoly over people's souls I don't know like I just feel like there should be more equality between those who believe in ya know progressive ideas and the Catholic Church\n\nI mean yea I agree with you completely I was just saying my personal beliefs\n\nare like I'm not going to join a religion because I don't personally\n\nright I'm just trying to give an idea of like where I was coming from in this debate\n\nLike you mean an excuse to not have a real opinion? \n\nI guess that's where like I feel the Catholic Church's influence is kind of a problem like especially like in the realm of politics where I mean the south is going to vote conservative that's not going to change and I would attribute a lot of that well ok there's like gun control and all that but I would attribute a lot of it to the Catholic Church and \n\nonce I said it I was like wait\n\nthe south is like primarily Baptist like um yea I guess my point is just religion in general holds too much of a sway over people \n\num I'm not too familiar with like some of the [inaudible] of the Catholic faith but um like what like the specific reasoning behind them not being allowed to marry is it just like they should be devoted completely to G-d?\n\nI think it's just interesting cause now like the opposite is kind of happening and now the fact that they can't marry is causing them to be more corrupt and sin\n\nI feel like if they had the option to marry I mean I'm not gonna jump in and say that the Catholic Church should change the way it does things I mean I have no say whatsoever in this religion but ya know I feel that that would help I mean the priests who are not like Jesus because no can be like Jesus because he was like [inaudible] perfect sinless person I don't know.\n",
        "Cause the other ones might not agree with\n\nNo I can respect them for sticking to a certain moral code like um if a certain institution whether it be a church or whatever over time it it's changing every chance it gets every time the society changes there's certain aspects that should change to keep updated with society and there's certain things you need to keep as a part of tradition to keep you ya know well grounded that's pretty much like all I could respect them for but as far as just somethings like I heard from a friend that the whole idea of eating not eating meat on Fridays during Lent didn't even has like no founding\n\nIn any of the early biblical times it was something to do with fishing history or something \n\nOr sorry go ahead\n\nYea we're kinda liken the Church to a politician just in the sense that they feel like if they let one of these issues go realize they need to come up to date that they think that they're gonna lose their whole following like I think that they wouldn't necessarily disagree with some of the changes being called for but they feel like it would cause a great deal of instability within the church saying ya know oh you've forgotten what it's all about and you're changing and are you really credible anymore \n\nI feel like that's what I don't agree with that but I think the leaders of the church might think that it would cause instability \n\nI wouldn't even agree that all the morals come from just the Catholic Church \n\nYea we talked about that in my Theology class and and their reasoning behind that \n\nYea we talked about that exact example the telephone game and their reasoning behind it is that the Holy Spirit has helped um the original message to come across two millenniums\n\nThe Holy Spirit seems like some sort of I'm sorry like a like a fabrication I don't see \n\nOf course\n\nHas anybody heard of Nietzsche um the philosopher Nietzsche's view on Christianity\n\nWell\n\nNo he didn't people translated his works to believe that he did but he had this idea that morality was separated into a master morality and slave morality and that the idea of slave morality um is what brought about Christianity that um people who were in oppression and in slave positions like um the Hebrews like Moses and them and then um [inaudible] Christians um around Jerusalem that they were oppressed and they create this whole value system that those in like a master more powerful position \n\nAre wrong and since they're in a weaker position they they fabricate these morals to show that they're right and then these morals kind of built the Christian system and they create their own superhero which is like G-d to kind of show them that they're right I mean I'm not saying I agree or not agree I just think it's a really interesting idea that it could have all just been fabricated as a a moral belief system\n\nTo oppose to oppose what was facing them at the time\n\nMethodist but it's just by on paper\n\nI think that's the problem is so many people have founded their moral beliefs in their upbringing within a religious environment so it's kinda hard to separate that they might not even know they're doing it until we get some people from the outside looking in saying yea your belief came from Christianity\n\nUh-huh\n\nTo go back to your point earlier um I don't know maybe you got this in your Sophomore English or supplemental English kind of thing you read Emerson's like Divinity School address or anything he's written on religion any of you? It's kinda talking about your idea though that um modern churches and I guess the church always has lost um certain impersonal touch with um the lay people that you've got somebody up their preaching you but what does he really know about you or what you need for your life and so like what Emerson would advocate is the whole idea of um a kind of not your own G-d but you know what you need to develop religiously and spiritually and you only you can know what's inside and what you need so you need to take a certain amount of self-reliance and \n\nDo you necessarily need to be speaking or acting from some G-d to cause that sort of change\n\nCertainly I know I'm not saying I disagree with you or anything\n\nI'm just presenting the idea that I mean people ever think about that you don't I mean like you said you're going and changing somebody else's belief system do you necessarily need to take this to them this is the way to believe this is gonna help you and give you faith\n\nWell it kinda seems like it seems it can't be just a coincidence that all those priests did it it must have something to do with their background is it their chaste or\n\nExactly\n\nI don't really feel that the tendency um came necessarily afterward or I'm sorry the tendency did come afterwards and it's not like they um\n\nRight I think um how they were brought up just living the life in the church that's what kinda may have I don't think it's necessarily that they have that tendency and then they get in this position of power and use it cause it just seems like there's way too many examples that happen I mean sure you're gonna have a couple of priests yea and maybe that just was the way they were but so many it just has to be more than a coincidence\n\nIt kind of seems even contradictory to the Catholic Church just [inaudible] that's what they wrote\n\nExactly \n\nYea I've heard that they're big drinkers in the Catholic Church \n\nThere's also a lot of differences between then and now  cultural differences which just comes back to the very question we're supposed to be answering\n\nI know that's what it's supposed to do \n\nUh-huh\n\n\n",

Like with pictures\n \nCause I think those are two totally different things, but on the other hand, if they see that\n\nWell, cause a lot of uh for instance in my school there was a picture taken with a kid um actually that's a totally different thing because he went to like Chili's and he saw a teacher at the bar and he had a picture with a beer and then like it was a huge controversy or whatever but since the teacher's in the picture I guess that's different\n\nNo, he wasn't even drinking.\n\nYeah, just the teacher was drinking the teacher had\n\nYeah, exactly that's stupid some schools would find that \n\nI don't even think they should tell the parents.\n\nWhat?\n\nThis school's ridiculous.\n\nI don't know how Myspace works. \n\nYeah\n\nI think a lot of the schools take it over the top for discipline, but on the other hand, to prevent a school shooting that's awesome\n\nVery true. What else can we say about this subject?\n\nI think it's stupid.\n\nIt really depends on how they believe that whatever they see on Facebook will reflect person's work habits.\n\nI think it should be like on a personal basis that you should judge that like my Facebook someone looks at it like this kid's weird they're gonna say this kid I mean obviously he's an ok kid but I wouldn't ya know pick him out of a hundred people just doesn't show how good of a worker he is I mean I'm not saying I'm amazing or anything, but I am a good worker like and my Facebook totally doesn't reflect that\n\nI'm in a cowboy hat in all my Facebook pictures.\n\nThat's awesome.\n\nYeah, it's definitely not.\n\nAnd my 80s multi-colored sports coat.\n\nI even think like goin on Myspace is goin above and beyond like\n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy, but I totally think it's an invasion \n\nWhat?\n\nMy school totally did.\n \nAw no way\n\nThat's ridiculous.\n\nWow.\n\nWhere would you guys draw the line? Did we just have this conversation?\n\nWe would always have the infamous code orange. Cause ever since 9-11 where we practiced in case terrorists came into our school because \n\nWell like in case terrorists would ya know wanted to go into our high school because that's a totally legitimate thing and so like we would all like corner into like a corner and uh \n\nThat's when they would bring the dogs out and\n\nYou wanted to stay away from the windows you're all looking to see if the ninjas would fly in through the windows \n\nYup it was ridiculous it was all just like\n \nThat's Maryland for ya\n\nExactly, exactly or also school shootings\nTake it example by example I guess\n\nWould you think that the line should be any different\n\nWhy should it though?\n\nYou pay, you pay them more and then they go further into your privacy\n\nI think you should retain more rights at a private school than you should a public school.\n\nI went to a private college\n\nWhat were you trying to say?\n\nIt's weird those schools get away with so much.\n\nHow's that invasion of privacy?\n\nHow's that an invasion of privacy though?\n\nWhat?\n\nThat's bull.\n\nThat's totally crossing the line\n\nI'd just get my uh tuition's worth out of that needless to say\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Indeed, I think that one of the major criticisms um  of the U.S. by other countries in the world has been that we never stick with anything that we go into all these countries and then pull out without leaving them secure or um on good standing or anything like that um so while I'm also I don't believe that we should have invaded Iraq in the first place I think that at least Bush oughta get some credit for sticking it out um or at least it seems like that's um  is different from what previous presidents have done, and it's something that the rest of the world has called for um so maybe it's kind of an answer to that criticism\n\nAlthough, the way it is now a lot of people in congress are against staying so I say that\n\nSee, I think that the United States does try to help other countries or at least they think that they try to help other countries, but the thing is they don't actually understand the culture of other countries and they don't understand that what works in America will not work everywhere else, and er I mean people I mean this has happened to the United States before I mean even in places like South America the United States has implemented democracies and then and then the people once they're in the functioning democracy they elect someone that the United States doesn't like and then they try to I think the United States wants to have too much control\n\nOver and it just doesn't work because other countries, different cultures, different histories I mean it's not like our government when it first began was functioning all that well in the beginning it took a long time for it \n\nAnd I mean what we had a Civil War in over a hundred years after the country was founded so it's I think it was extremely unrealistic expectations going in\n\nI mean and even on the part of the American people because a lot of the American people supported it at the beginning the\n\nAnd the thing is I think that the that the solution needs to come from within the actual country\n\nAnd the U.S. just never really allows that to happen anywhere.\n\nWell outside help is is necessary, but it but they it has to be help it can't be control\n\nI think one of the themes biggest themes of this war is um  the United States not being prepared\n\nI mean even now I mean see in the newspapers um about the army hospitals, and how they're just not equipped to deal with most of the brain injuries of the soldiers and things like that\n \nMilitarily  becoming militarily involved in the country and trying to [inaudible] their government that has happened\n\nSo many times and I mean there hasn't been a you know good way of handling it yet you think they would just learn not to do it in the first place\n\nYeah\n\nAt least that's something that hasn't been tried before actually sticking with a country and staying in\n\nI mean in most of the in pretty much all of the other instances or similar situations the United States has gotten itself into we've kind of just pulled out\n\nI mean, even well when we pulled out of Vietnam that was I mean evacuations were so sudden that a lot of people that got hurt were the people that were non-Americans but who were helping Americans who they recruited to help a lot of people from other Asian countries, and um  I mean so hasty pull out would definitely not be\n\n2003\n\nAnd, one of the problems I have I think is that the popular view is so much just get out now\n\nAnd even in congress, the partisanship like Democrats just you know get out\n\nYeah\n\nThat was the same people that wanted us to go in, in the first place.\n\nYeah\n\nThis isn't a war either.\n\nThey're not declared wars is what it is but in all fairness, there are people like you know in newspapers and media who do compare it to Vietnam\n \nWhich is what is wrong with \n\nSee, and I think one of the mistakes that our government made was um invading without consent of the U.N.\n\nAnd they just blatantly going against the U.N.'s orders because the only way that the U.N. is actually gonna function and you know it doesn't really function very well anymore is\n\nUh, yeah but exactly and the idea is that it's the members that have to make it work by cooperation and things like that and you know the U.S. was supposed to be this you know beacon of light or power or whatever and \n\nOh no I was just\nIt's just a fact, but then again how do you how do you pick and choose what dictators you're gonna take out of power you know?\n\nPolls themselves aren't even that reliable.\n\nAnd that's why well that's one of the reasons that you know our country formed the government that it did was to control the media against popular whims and things like that\n\nNo\n\nAnd I think also like you said before it's uh you know called it well first what first it was operation Iraqi freedom, isn't that what it was called?\n\nBut I think you can make the argument that what happened with Bush's father is on President Bush's mind when he's making this decision.\n\nI mean I think you can make the argument.\n \nAnd in going after him, he's separating himself from him because he's doing something that his father couldn't accomplish.\n",
        " I think it's still an issue  but it's slowly  being fixed\n\n Yea\n\n Definitely  like  there's  I mean  there's no opportunities growing up that women have different from men  I mean  as far as schooling goes  I mean  there's all guys schools that are great and stuff  but there's also all girls schools \n\n Yea\n\n Right  it's mostly like\n\n Yea\n\n Yea\n\n Wow\n\n Wow \n\n Not a bad idea to commercialize education\n\n Right\n\n Right  that's a pretty good idea\n\n Definitely not in education \n\n Right\n\n Yea\n\n Yea \n\n I feel like  um  they compliment  accomplishments of women are being a lot more celebrated to  like in the newspaper  you would hear  like  it would be front page news if a woman makes CEO  as opposed to a guy\n\n And  I mean  that's  it's kinda turning the other way  cause people want to highlight about how non-gender discriminatory they're being  and \n\n Yea\n\n Right  and I mean  even  like  almost all of the colleges I looked at were at least like 60-40  girls to guys \n\n Yea  so I mean  it's not like women aren't being educated  and  becoming part of the workforce\n\n Yea\n \n Yea\n\n The thing is  I feel like it's gone in cycles throughout history  where women have like cared what status they had  and then  they settled down\n\n And then they cared again  cause with like women's voting and stuff  and I know back in like  back during like  the civil war  and after that  in a period of abolition and stuff  I mean  there were women who were going along with that movement  saying  hey  we're working for these rights for slaves  lets also work for our own rights  and then  like  so many years later  in 1920  right to vote  and then  the whole 50s and 60s era  of the stay at home mom  who cooks and  doesn't  I wonder how many of those women voted  and now  all of a sudden it's important again  in the last  20 years  so I don't know  maybe once we're CEOs  guys will get some  we'll settle down [laughter] and guys will reach a higher level than that  and then  we'll have to catch up again  I don't know why that goes like that\n\n Uh-huh  it is  I just think it's funny that there's huge gaps of time where no one seems to care\n\n That's true  it is kind of shoved down our throats here  but  I mean  I think it serves to remind us  that not every place in the world is like this\n\n And I mean  in four years  you're not gonna be  in a  work force that's 90% Caucasian anymore  or 60% women  or\n\n Yea. I actually think a lot of it has to do with  um  a lot of the  um  the  cultural change that's going towards the approval of women being in power now  has a lot to do with like the media and TV  cause  even on like sitcoms now  the woman has a job  and  it's not Leave it to Beaver [Laughter]  and  you can like  they show women in like  high office positions  and it just gets people used to it  like  from a very young age  and it's like  hey  this is acceptable  and  it's cool  so  I think people just don't think of it as much when they see it everyday\n\n Uh-huh\n\n Yea\n\n Yea \n\n And even  I mean  you were saying that guys promote guys more often than they promote women  well  women probably promote women more often than they promote men\n\n Because of  as you were saying  the communication thing  we understand how we communicate better  so  I mean  yea  there's  I think there is  but  I don't know  even with the interior decorator thing  I think  shows like Queer Eye and stuff\n\n Are bringing it more out  and  you just don't think as much of it\n\n Yea\n\n Yea\n\n Yea  the lawsuits are definitely helping that \n\n They are\n\n Um  ok  well I mean  before  there were  there were laws against discrimination in the workplace and stuff  but they weren't really enforced  and people started  calling them out on that  calling out companies  and being like  hey  you can't do this  and hiring lawyers  and fighting it  and  that not only hit companies where their money was  it also brought  um  issues of discrimination into the eye of the public  which  created a whole chain effect  which caused other women to maybe realize that they weren't being treated fairly  and  brought the whole thing into a new level \n\n Well  no\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Yeah I mean I didn't even look at the terminology I don't think it really matters I think that more to appease people but whether you call it a marriage or you call it a legal union, it's still the same thing. So I support it completely.\n\nWell marriage doesn't have to be religious people get married in like courts and stuff\n\nI don't think a government would really have any excuse not to ya know unless they're\n\nBasing their government on religion\n\nYeah which they shouldn't be doing.\n\nSo would you be considered married if you by today's standard got married in a court you wouldn't be married then?\n\nWhy would you name it differently then?\n\nSo the church wouldn't accept gay marriage?\n\nDo you think that it's against Christianity or Catholicism like you personally?\n\nCause I know other churches accept it like I'm Episcopalian and I've seen like gay um marriages.\n\nNo um cause they obviously interpret the Bible to accept it so do you think any Catholics do? Or do you as a catholic?\n\nagainst it\n\nHave you come into contact with Catholics that think that it's acceptable?\n\nUm do you think like if something started it would gain support in the catholic church? like among not among like Priests and stuff but it seems like among a lot of practicers\n\nPracticing Catholics that do think that it's ok\n\nWe grew up in an area where the followers would probably support it more.\n\nI'm from New Jersey.\n\nI don't think everything is cause I think like people feel associated with a certain political party and they feel like they have to stay in line with those views even if if it were an isolated issue they may feel otherwise like especially with religion they feel like they have to stick with what they were living and support it even if you just presented it separately they might not say the same thing.\n\nThere's so much controversial stuff goin on that people feel like they have to pick and party and they can't ya know feel liberal about somethings\n\nThat's what cuts it off from everybody whereas if you have it states at least some states will\n\nCivil war?\n\nThere'd have to be like they'd have to either allow it or disallow it so like who makes that decision?\n\nRight.\n\nYeah well that's what you said before.\n\nOh yeah.\n\nYeah cause people have feelings about him already\n\nUm so\n\nOh I have a good idea what we could talk about like how do you think it affects their kids or if they want to have kids? things like that\n\nWell I don't know to them it's just like not a big deal [inaudible]\n\nNo like I can't associate anyone with a certain religion.\n\n",
        "I think in terms of like what you call it versus like the state versus the church  like there is a separation of church and state. And even  I know the Catholic church doesn't necessarily  if you get married not like in a physical church  like you can't do that within the Catholic Church.  So there's like a difference between  you have to get married you get legally married and you're also married by the church, so  \n\nUh huh, Yea, so  But like if you get married like by the state or like by a judge or something like that  that or like the marriage certificate that you get that's called a marriage certificate  but you still  if you want to get married in the Catholic Church have to do like the whole Catholic Church thing on top of that so  I think like that a gay marriage would just be  obviously you wouldn't have the catholic church aspect of it but you would just like have the legal part  so I think it could still be called a marriage because \n\nBack to what you were saying about  um  like it being a state thing versus a federal thing  um  if it's  like if gay marriage is legal  in like a couple of states  like  is that enough? Like could people who want to get married  could they just like go to that state? Or is it gonna be \n\nOh is that it? \n\nRight, yea yea.\n\nDo you think maybe it's like for tax purposes and everything you have to be living in that state?\n\nOr  Cause otherwise  then like it  it seems  like if it is recognized  I mean if it is  I don't know  on the one hand it seems like it's weird that it wouldn't be recognized in other states but  on the other hand if it is recognized by other states then could you just go that one state and get married and then go back to where you were? Like  and then like why would we need a whole bunch of states to legalize it? I don't know. \n\nYou can just read and take things in certain ways. \n\nwell I think the Catholic church is like  the most outspoken against it which is why  like  it's always like  pinned on the Catholic church as opposed to it  or like outwardly opposed to it  I'm kinda changing the subject  but  um  I believe that there's a law  like if two people are living together  for like\n\nYea  seven years  then they're like considered legally married  um  now like  they wouldn't be considered married by the Catholic church  but they'd be considered legally married \n\nSo   would like the same rule apply to  like two males that are living together  I mean  I guess not  but if  if that  like  what about in a state where gay marriage is legal  would that law apply? And then  if so  like how do you distinguish like  let's just say there's just like two roommates  that are just living together  then  they like wind up being considered married  and like  I think that's like more for taxation purposes than for anything else but  with the separation of  like church and state there's a difference between a legal marriage and a marriage in  the church  so  if you really want to talk about a separation of church and state you can take  all the Catholic church's opposition and all that and move that over to the church side and then when you're left with the state marriage  like  I don't  like what you were saying  I don't see how you can say they can't be married.\n\nYea\n\nuh-huh\n\nOn what basis is he pushing for this? Does anyone know?\n\nThat's very true\n\nUh-huh\n\nAnd what's interesting too  like you have people who are very much opposed to it  but I think that  alright  hold on  let me start over   um  you have people who gay marriage would actually apply to and that would only be gay people  and then you have  of like all the heterosexual people you have people w ho are very much opposed to it and other people who even though they wouldn't really affected by any laws  like allowing or like  being against gay marriage they still realize that like  even though it doesn't affect them they also at the same time don't have a right to prevent it  so  I think that there's like the majority of the people would fall into  like  not like the huge opposition category  so I don't think that law could ever really get passed\n\nUh-huh\n\nI think we're all pretty much [inaudible]\n\ninaudible\n\n\n",

        "\nYes\n\nOk go with it\n\nI yea I agree with you guys that it should um be allowed um but I think I don't know if um it would be such a big change that I don't like if it was up to me I don't know what I would do cause it's just like what you're saying what we're so used to and what it would just almost be like it would be so hard to get used to ya know it's not longer that you could guess out a married couple anymore it's like you would have there's so many different options then\n\nOnce that would happen and I think that's what some people are now scared about like seeing this it would be such a drastic change it would create like that whole um what is the name for that family like the nuclear family\n\nIs it that what it was called?\n\nA nuclear family would totally change\n\nLike those things that we learned would just be so different and I think there's a lot of people that are set in their ways and it may be until we all have kids that there is actually change cause there's that generation just had to die out \n\nWe're gonna make more moves towards it \n\nAt this time I don't know if um I would vote it in like now\n\nBecause I think it's people there aren't enough people accepting of it and then I think that would be unfair to say if there was a married couple and they had kids they adopted or they just had kids or something I think the kids because not all people are accepting of it now that it would be unfair to the kids that the kids would get taunted or something like that\n\nBut I definitely would want it for the future like the near future but\n\nYea I just yea I just feel like it would just there would be so many people that are against it and have like a hate for homosexual relationships and just I I can't see it being I feel like it would there would just be a lot of bad that would come with\n\nIt happening\n\nUh-huh\n\nOh ok\n\nOk yea well when you compare it to that I mean\nThat is a very good point. \n\nYea\n\nSo why do they whyhow do they take a how do they \n\nUh-huh \n\nWhen um was a law made that banned gay marriage?\n\nThere is no law?\n\nSo then what\n\nOh so there is no amendment for the banning of gay marriage\n\nIt's just states don't allow it?\n\nWhen did states start banning it or was it just always in a states\n\nLike they're allowed to?\n\nNew Jersey allows gay couples to marry? And California?\n\nForeign countries do?\n\nSame sex\n\nAnd then [Inaudible]\n\nA teenager, right?\n\nYea I think there's a lot of angry people concerned worried that becoming that concerning this topic \n\nSame sex?\n\nWhat does the bible does the bible really flat out say no to same sex?\n\nThe Old Testament does?\n\nWhat does it just \n\nMurder?\n\nSo it's just like gossiping?\nThat's so then for that to be forgiven you have to end relations \n\nTo be forgiven for like I'm just saying to be forgiven for something like that what do you have to do then just end relations with\n\nFor\n\nDo your parents know?\n\nNo?\n\nOk \n\nOh keep going\n\nHow um how do what are some people's explanations of of homosexuality? Do you know like do you think it's genetics? Ya know some people say it must be the way they were raised or is it genetics?\n\nSo genetics more internal like that's just the way you are the way \n\nThat's why I'm bringing it up cause there was a little section\n\nI grew up across the street from a boy who was two years old than me and I hung out with all his friends but like I hung out with them I thought they were cute and like I didn't\n\nLike I I would do things like even from when we were younger like we would be out playing hide and go seek manhunt like over summer like water balloon fights and everything but I don't know about that never made me like they treated me as one of the guys but I knew I wasn't like I would still run around in little skirts\n\nUh-huh\n\nUh-huh\n\nUh-huh\n\nThere's gay sheep?\n\nThat's very interesting.\n\nSo then it really isn't your environment almost if sheep are that way\n\nLike it's just something that's been in us\n\nSee I never heard of that I never knew that animals expressed\n\nAnd don't we stem from animals?\n\nWow\n\nDo democrats will they allow for it?\n\nHe's taking a very bold stand and just flat out\n\nSaying it\n\nAnd amendments are meant to restrict the government.\n\nAbout the woman?\n\nSilence\n\nI think all people should have the same rights to be able to yea forgetting about their sexuality that everyone should have equal rights\n",

        "In my personal opinion, I do not feel that the Catholic Church needs to allow women to become priests.  There is already a shortage of women who want to become nuns, and I don’t really think that THAT many more women would enter the religious life if they could become priests.  (If a woman REALLY feels called to serve the Catholic Church, then she will likely become a nun.  I don’t know how many women are so deterred from the religious life just because they can’t be priests.)   \nI do, however, believe that priests should be allowed to marry.  As stated in previous posts, this has worked for other Protestant religions.  As I understand it, the reasons that the Catholic Church has for requiring celibacy is two-fold.  1.) Jesus was not married, so priests should not be either and 2.)  Having a wife and family could detract from priestly duties.   I feel that the contrary is actually true:  a priest who is married and has a family would be able to better connect with the church community because he could better relate to the majority of the congregation.  And I don’t think that Protestant ministers are any less devout because they are married.\nOn the subject of the Catholic Church changing its ways, I feel that they need to be very careful in making those decisions.  The Catholic Church prides itself on being grounded in tradition, so to just change things all around would take away from this.  On the other hand, I believe that there are certain changes that DO need to be made.  The Church has gone through all sorts of changes over the ages.  There have been different councils and meetings where the leaders of the church have decided on certain “laws.”  Since the traditions of the church are essentially man-made, I believe that, within certain reasons, there is need for change.  (Since the laws were originally made by humans, I feel that if it will help the Church keep its numbers up, some changes can be made to adapt to current society.) \n\n",
        "Is there really a reason to refuse marriage to gay couples? I can’t see one.  Most homosexual couples aren’t asking for a religious marriage, they are asking for the legalities allowed to heterosexual couples.  As it stands now, people in a homosexual relationship can’t share in a partner’s benefits from work, and have no claim to their partner should something terrible happen.  Sometimes it even seems like by denying even a civil union to homosexual couples we are undermining their very existence.  It seems like we are saying they don’t deserve the right to the same type of life as heterosexual couples.  Another argument used against homosexual “marriage” is that they can’t have children.  Well if that’s the argument, should we allow those couples that don’t plan on having children to marry?  And for that matter, heterosexual couples that cannot have children should not be allowed the status of marriage.  When we discriminate against one group we end up discriminating against everyone.  Personally I think the argument over this “issue” is ridiculous.  Homosexuals aren’t different from anyone else, so why should there be laws saying what they can and cannot do.  Sometimes I feel like the laws are being made to shut up those few people who disagree with a lifestyle choice.  The people who have no problem with homosexual couples aren’t going to make a ruckus, so they aren’t heard, they are drowned out by the yelling of a relative few.  No one should be punished for living their life the way that makes them happy.  Denying gay couples the right to a union is denying them happiness, and that is denying the very basis of what our country was built on.  Our forefathers may have been puritans but they left an oppressive government for freedom, freedom for everyone.  Not just whites, not just Christians, not just heterosexuals, everyone. \n\n",
        "Four years ago, when the US originally invaded Iraq, most of America didn’t know anything about the country.  Most people knew it was in the Middle East, which was the same area that the 9/11 terrorists originated, and we believed what we were told: that this would be short war with remarkable results for our country’s safety and economy.  Even now, half our country can’t find Iraq on a map.  But now at least the majority of our country is in agreement that we made a mistake in entering.  Theres little use arguing in hindsight over motivations for entry or political corruption; now that we’re in, we need to figure out how to get out.  Sure, we could spend time and money to impeach the president and start afresh, but its so late in his presidency that it would just be a waste.\n Surely, Bush will not back down.  He believes strongly in this war, for whatever reason, and theres really no budging at all until his term runs out.  Hopefully our next president (with our new congress) will takes steps in the right direction.  And my personal opinion is that the first step should be withdrawal.  Its time to reverse ”diplomacy is dead,” because now war has failed and maybe its time to show our enemies that we are a compassionate country, not an imperialist one.  Not only is continued occupation taking a toll on our soldiers and economy, but a recent survey of Iraqis showed that the majority of their country opposed occupation and found reconstruction efforts minimal and insufficient.  Perhaps it is time to give them what they want and leave.  We can still support their government and country without forcing democracy on them.  Simply put, democracy does not mix well at all with Islamic countries.  It is a western ethic that doesnt mesh with the values of their religion and has been proven again and again not to work.  Lets stop trying to Americanize the middle east.  And the first step towards that is the removal of our troops from their country.   \n\njust to make some comments on what ive heard people say…\nyes, we need to support our president.  if a country isnt united we simply arent strong and are even more susceptible to attack.  However, we voted for a president, not a king.  the presidents primary function should be to serve and protect his country.  if he doesnt have the support of his country and doesnt do what the people want him to do, than how is this a democracy?  we act like we are spreading “freedom” to the middle east but i dont think we even know what that means.  in basic democratic theory, if a leader isnt serving the people then the people have the right to revolt and depose of him.  i agree this isnt the right thing to do right now, but if we dont voice our opinions and concerns, what kind of democracy are we?  the fact that we can “not support our president”  is a real demonstration of freedom and is a much better option than just blindly supporting whatever measure of shit our president gets stuck in.\nto comment on the medias role in all of this…people tend to believe that the media has a negative slant and doesnt mention the positive things about this war.  oh wait, thats right.  were in a war.  war isnt positive.  if 200 people die everyday in a war, whats the positive part? that we moved our forces a little bit?  please tell me what the positive things are because im really interested.  and dont bother mentioning saddam.  if you enter a small country with a ridiculously superior force and dont manage to capture or kill the only nameable enemy you entered to find, then maybe you should stop invading countries.  oh wait. hold up. thats what happened in afghanistan. we went in to find bin laden (the actual terrorist behind 9/11) and OH NO WE STILL HAVENT FOUND HIM.  besides this, however, 58% of Iraqis recently polled have found reconstruction efforts to be minimal or nonexistent. so what are we doing in here? have there been positives?  please inform me.\nso, im sorry if i offended anyone with my sarcasm.  however, i just watched bush give a press conference on the war on terror and it reminded how much i cant wait for the next election. \n\n\u001a",
        "As a member of the Roman Catholic Church, there are certain traditions that I believe should be changed, those that perpetuate inequality and gender discrimination, as well as those that were formed for reasons that no longer matter in our present society.  I am talking about the exclusion of women from the priesthood, and the rules that do not allow priests to get married and have families once they have become priests (because there are cases in which a married man, usually a minister in a different Christian Church, is allowed to convert to Catholicism and become a priest).  There are many good reasons to allow women into the priesthood besides the simple fact that the way it is now the Church condones inequality.  Like the discussion starter mentions, there is severe dearth of priests in the Catholic Church.  I’m sure there are a number of women who gladly fill those open positions if given the chance.  Isn’t denying them the chance just hurting the congregations?  I also think that it would have been much more difficult for the priest sex scandals to remain a secret as long as they did if women had been members of the clergy.\n \nWith regard to marriage, it was only in the 11th century that the Church decided that priests could no longer get married.  At that time, the Church was the most powerful institution in Europe, and its officials, including priests, owned a lot of land.  The Church didn’t want to lose this land to the families of the priests, and so they forbad priests to get married.  Yes, there were spiritual arguments offered for the change in tradition, but the main motives behind the decision were power and greed.\nHaving said all that, I believe that the tenets of the Catholic faith are very important in today’s society.  Considering the fast-pace changes that occur in all areas of our lives, technology, science, entertainment, etc., I think that it’s essential to have at least one stable, steadfast presence in our lives. \n\n",
        "            Gender discrimination is very common in many places, including the United States.  The problems that we see as Americans in our own society are probably doubled or tripled in other countries where tradition has higher value, and gender roles are firmly rooted in the past.  Nonetheless, the issue of unevenness between males and females is a serious issue that should be addressed as quickly as possible.\n            Feminism is a very popular belief that men and women should be treated as equals.  That is, there should be no preconceived prejudices about one sex or the other.  I think that most people would believe in the feminist cause, though few would be willing to admit it because of the connotation associated with feminism.  People associate feminists with being fiery zealots, and the word feminism recalls images of suffragists and public displays.  Women’s suffrage was but a milestone along the path of feminism, but it was one that has made an impression on people because of its significance and the way in which it was achieved.  Women’s suffrage was actually achieved in England during a period of war before it was achieved in the United States.  Perhaps the reason we today associate the suffrage movement with zealousness is that in order to make their cause heard in a time of war, women’s suffragists had to be loud and adamant about their cause.\n            Though women’s suffrage was a very public and passionate movement, it is also possible to achieve steps towards the elimination of gender discrimination in more subtle ways.  Laws such as the Equal Pay Act and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act help make the public more conscious of the areas in which gender discrimination permeates to today.  The most obvious manifestation of this discrimination is in the workplace, which these acts target. With attention focused on this inequality, perhaps equality between men and women in the workplace can someday be achieved.  While the workplace is the most common and notable venue for gender discrimination, there are many other scenarios in which men and women can be treated unfairly.  Not all of these can be helped by laws, but they can all be helped by a better understanding of the problem of gender discrimination, its causes, and its consequences. \n\n",
        "Part of what makes the Catholic Church what it is and give it such a strong foundation is the fact that it is rooted in centuries of tradition and its influence is so wide spread. It was not until recently that they began experiencing any problems in the areas of celibacy and lack of interest. Changing these traditions now I think would take away from what the Church initially founded itself on and would also take an enormous amount of time. The change would also have to occur in the Vatican, which is no where near as far along as the United States when it comes to modernizing. Because of the national influence Catholicism has, change would take a great movement. However in contrast, allowing priests to marry and/or allowing female priests could possibly end the problems with pedophilia as well as spark more interest in priesthood. It does make sense that the Catholic Church should change with the times, but in doing so it would lose part of its identity. It’s kind of just a lose-lose situation. \n\nSo from my chat groups I learned that the tradition of priests not being able to marry actually comes from the 12th or 13th century. When priests would die, rather than leaving their land to the church, they would leave it to their children, therefore taking land away from the church. The church then instated the rule of not letting priests marry in order to maximize the amount of land they possessed, because now when priests died, they would inherit the land. So it seems as though this tradition of remaining celibate actually grew out of the church’s greed rather than some holy sanction. This kind of changes my view on things in that I don’t see the tradition of priests not being able to marry as something so sacred and in changing the rule, it wouldn’t really take away from the church, because it was started for a corrupt reason anyway. In changing this tradition, more people would be attracted to the priesthood and maybe the church would not be involved in so much scandal. \n\n\u001a",
        "Despite the number of laws mentioned in the discussion starter, laws intended to promote equality between the sexes in the workplace and in the educational system, there exists a great disparity between the number of men and women in certain career fields, and in some of these fields it is very difficult to find a women in a top-level position.  My dad is an engineer, and he has often commented about the lack of women in his field, especially women in positions of power.\nObviously certain ideas persist in America about the academic abilities of men and women, especially when the president of a university such as Harvard can declare that women can’t do math or science as well as men because of “innate” differences.\n \nI do feel however, that gender discrimination exists against men as well, and that this is often overlooked.  Girls used to be the members of the elementary school classes who received less attention from the teacher, or whose wrong answers were excused.  But I think that in a lot of places, an attempt to correct these kinds of teaching practices has led to overcompensation, and that boys are now the ones suffering.  Look at the statistics of the students who attend college today.  On most campuses throughout this country, girls are in the majority, and Loyola is no exception.  Yes there are studies that show that in general boys and girls learn and develop differently.  But there is so much variation simply from one individual to the next, and this is how teachers should treat their students, looking at them as individuals.\n \nI would agree that a certain stigma exists against women who want to be “just” wives and mothers; at least, this is what I gather from my own experience.  I attended an all-girls private high school, and it was completely taboo to make any other plans except for attending the best college that you could get into.  We students had to maintain the college attendance rate of 100%.  Meanwhile, what one of the smartest girls in the class above me really wanted to do was start a family.  This was her goal and I think it’s just as important and just as essential as a woman who wants to be a scientist or a lawyer.   \n\n",
        "I do not agree with Bush’s continuation of the war in Iraq because it is not accomplishing anything. There have been very few victories on our side for the amount we have had to pay in actual dollars and human lives. I think it is impossible to call the war in Iraq a war on terrorism when terrorism is so prevalent in around the world; Iraq is just one of many and even if by some miracle America won the war in Iraq, it would only be a very small victory against terrorism. I am not against the fight against terrorism, especially since it threatens not only the American way of life, but western society as a whole, but I am against the way Bush has gone about it. I think that it is impossible to be successful in this endeavor if he does not have the support of not only this nation, but others. It is impossible to fight this fight all on your own. I recently saw a documentary called Obsession (I highly recommend it), which was about the effects of radical Islam. There is an enormous Muslim population in the world, and the majority of them are not at all violent or in agreement with jihad, however the number of Muslims that are is more than the population of the U.S. Because of this, it is impossible for the U.S. to go about this alone. Some of the most alarming parts of this documentary was the genuine hatred that those who are advocates for jihad have for the west. This hatred is ingrained in them beginning in childhood and the amount of passion they have for their cause is more than I’ve ever seen for anything else. The most disturbing part of the documentary was the parallels they presented between the jihad and the Nazis. I think that the world is underestimating what the advocates of jihad are capable of, kind of like they did with the Nazis. I think that Bush is right to want to battle terrorism and put an end to it, but his methods thus far have been very ineffective. The Iraqi war at this point is a lost cause at my opinion and in order for anything to truly be accomplished on any level, more countries need to be willing to contribute. \n\n",

Women  are unknowingly discriminated against in that when they are stay-at-home moms other women look at them like they don’t know the what hard work is because they have to do is take care of the home and their kids. And the women who work all their lives and have missed their “prime” and aren’t able to have kids are seen as not completely the one thing they were put on this earth to do. What’s also disheartening about this situation is that women discriminate against other women. Women who are stay-at-home moms discriminate against “butch” women, and women who live the traditional heterosexual lifestyle discriminate against women who are homosexual. And the list goes on.\nGender discrimination has been getting progressively better over the years. Women and men have gone from the traditional roles of homemaker and moneymaker to many of them switching roles and maybe even both of them being the moneymakers. Slowly as the older generation, who are stuck in committing to the traditional roles in the households pass away, this new idea of switching roles and leaving childrearing to the end of their lives is gradually becoming socially acceptable.  \nAnd in response to LoColady’s last paragraph, I honestly was taken back when I first read that she doesn’t see herself having a family. I must say that I have always thought that women at least had it in their plans to have a family just not anytime soon. I recognize this as a problem and that with time my mentality will change. But what I did think or at least what came to mind when I read that she wanted to spend her life in building her career, I thought of the image the media portrays driven women as. Staying up late working in their offices and having affairs with married men or with men who are paid for their sexual services. They live, eat, and breathe their work environment. Why can’t driven women be portrayed as happy and content with the lives they have chosen for themselves?\n\n",
        "I again agree that the church needs to change, however, I also belive that some of the traditions need to be kept. While I do find it somewhat difficult to accept that everything one man says goes in a society where everyone is raised in the ideas of democracy and collaborative decisions, in a way I also like having the Pope as the head of the church. I like that he is there to make sure that all of the churches across the world are teaching the same readings at every service and are giving the same answers to questions that are universally asked. This to me, cuts back on the questionablility of the church, because it is all the same and there are no differences that are sloshed about from congrigation to congrigation. This is not to say that I necessarily agree with every thing though, because I certainly don’t.I am not quite sure if I believe that woman should be priests or not…I guess I feel that they should maybe be called something differnt other than priests, but still be able to give communion. Or maybe they can be priests, not really sure on that area…I do know that I would probably be a little wierded out if i saw one as a priest giving communion at a catholic church, just becuase it has never happened before. \nI do however, strongly feel as if priests should be able and have the opportunity to be married again. THe only reason whey this privilage was taken away in the past was back in the day when the corruption occured in the catholic church (just as corruption has occured in every possible other religion.) But the priests and bishops were not paying any attention to their duties as priests and bishops and were paying more attention to thier personal lives. THat is why the law was made, but I feel as if we have definatly overcome this obstical and can now handel our priests getting married again. This is a huge reason why we do not have as many people being ordaned, because many would be priest also want families and so they usually opt for the family. I know that is the case for my father’s freind. He wanted a family and so found something else he enjoyed doing to take on as his career and instead stared a family.\nThese are the reasons why I think the church needs to change, but also find a balance in how to still stay a bit of the same. I feel as if we should still have a Pope, but have it so that his word is not the final and only word. That again, it is more of a president type figure and a democracy running religion. I like the basic set up of the Catholic religion, and I also like how they are very tollerant of other people’s religions and views, and accept what they believe in instead of automatically trying to change them. This is not to say that they do not spread the word of God to those that wish to listen and learn, because they do, but they do not force people into it. A lot of times people who are not Catholic, and probably even some people who are Catholic, think that they condem those who are not Catholic or push people into Catholism, but this is not the case at all. That is one aspect of the church that I really like. So I do believe that the church has a bit of adjusting to do, but does not need to get rid of all of its traditions, thoughts, ideas, customs,…etc.\n\n",
        "I’m definitely with Mtnbike9 on this one. I’ve never heard anyone make a reasonable, articulate argument for why gay marriage should be banned. Most arguments against it I’ve heard refer to marriage as a “sacred institution.” Well, if you go to a church and get married, then it’s certainly a sacred institution for you. But the fact of the matter is that sacraments are not a concern of the federal or the state governments. When a state issues a marriage license, it’s called a license for a reason. It’s a document with legal ramifications recognizing a special relationship between the two individuals involved. Denying gays marriage licenses is silly; it would be like refusing to grant forklift operator licenses to left-handed people.\nChurches are free to make whatever rules they want about who can get married in their churches. That’s their right. Their decisions and beliefs have no proper bearing on the law, though. Like it or not, we don’t live in a theocracy, and ideas about holy writ don’t hold up in court as rationalizations for stupid laws (or attempted constitutional amendments).\nThe fact that portions of the Republican Party (coughBushcough) would waste time clamoring for a ban on gay marriage demonstrates a gross misplacement of values. It looks like they’ve tabled that idea for the time being, and I’m glad (there happens to be an important geographic region of the Middle East that’s badly in need of a plan for stabilizing it. Somehow, this strikes me as being more important than stopping the government from issuing legalistic little pieces of paper to specific couples).\nAlso, the argument that heterosexual procreation provides the building blocks of civilization is not only dated, but unwieldy in a world that’s quickly becoming overpopulated. The government has absolutely no control of who has sex with whomever else, and any argument based on the idea that marriage licenses are somehow dispensed as have-legit-sex cards is laughable. \n\n",
        "I am all for same sex marriage. We live in a secular culture, we obey secular laws, and we do not reference the bible for every decision that we have to make in our lives. But for some reason we as a culture are sitting back and allowing our president to use the bible as the reason why same sex marriages should not be allowed in our country. I was a member of SAGABA in high school, which stands for the straight and gay and bisexual alliance, I met some of the most passionately in love men and women I know. So what if they were in love with members of the same sex, love is love is love no matter what the sexual orientation is. Does the idea of a man and a man living together really still scare our country? The topic of homosexuality has been raised in the media, on our reality television shows, and even with our very own vice president. When a show called the real world has seven cast members and every season at least one member is gay, doesn’t that say something about “the real world,” or at least how our society perceives it. Gay parents are perfectly capable of providing a safe and proper home for raising a child. It is my belief that an adopted son or daughter can flourish just the same with same sex parents as he or she would in a traditional household. If the love is real than the sexual preference should mean nothing. Our President holds his high Christian morals in very high regard. Undoubtedly growing up in Texas our president most likely had a slightly slanted impression of homosexuals. I know I am stereotyping a state an to be honest just a region of our country in general, but its tough for a southerner to see eye to eye with per say somebody from California or Massachusetts.\nThere should in no way be a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. The constitution lays the constructs on how to make our country a safe and efficiently run democracy. It does not tell us who to marry or what is moral. The constitution is not the bible and it does not contain “God’s word.” Therefore our president needs to stop quoting the bible as his reason for being so opposed to same sex marriage. I do not care one way or another if the bible describes marriage as between a man and a woman. Not every American is Christian and not every American is straight. If certain states want to ban gay marriage then legally there is no recourse to stop them. On the same hand if a state, such as California wants to legalize gay marriage they too should be able to do so. To make such a controversial issue with no clear cut conclusion into a federal law would be premature and unfair to a great percentage of accepting Americans. \n\n",
        "I absolutely feel as though the Catholic Church has to change its ways in order to adapt to the 21st century. Two major issues come to my mind when I think of the Catholic Church; those issues are Gay marriage and abortion. I am a very liberal person and I see eye to eye with many of the political views held my leftist in the political world. Thus I believe that gays should be allowed to marry just as any other couple that is in love should have the right to marriage and obviously I also believe that women should have the choice to abort a pregnancy should the circumstance present itself. The church does not believe that either should be allowed and its justification comes from religious doctrine that was given or written for us thousands of years ago. I don’t want to seem like I am mooching the church but to be honest things change drastically in a matter of decades let alone in a matter of centuries. We have the proper medical procedures to perform abortions with out harming the women. Furthermore, to quote church doctrine that is older than time, and say that a man can not marry another man because in the bible it says that marriage is between a man and a women is preposterous. In the biblical times if somebody were to come out and pronounce there homosexuality they could be subject to blood letting or a lobotomy, you know to get the “gay out of them.” Heck if you want to go back even further there are numerous written accounts of homosexual acts within the Spartan male communities as well as with in the Greek schools for men. Older Spartans would regularly engage in acts of homosexuality with younger Spartans and it was perfectly permissible. This leads me right into my next topic which would be older clergy men, specifically priests over stepping their bounds and engaging in sexual acts with younger church going boys. What is the difference between Sparta and the churches in Boston where Priests were raping boys? In Sparta it was part of the culture, in America it is a clear act of rape preformed by a priest that is sexually uneasy due to years of celibacy and perhaps in many cases unrequited love. The Catholic Church needs to start to allow their priests to marry. It may seem ridiculous due to centuries of church rule against it, however, a married sexually fulfilled priest could perform his job just as well as a celibate one, and without the worry of perhaps raping a boy. Rabbi’s and ministers of all other religions are permitted to marry and live normal lives all the while devoting themselves to their work and their God. Along the same lines, women are also allowed to be Rabbi’s and Ministers, to not allow women to be Catholic Priests is a major gender discrimination that our country has overlooked for far too long. It is time for the Church to meet the times, steps need to be taken to modernize what is now becoming an outdated major religious movement. \n\n",
        "Pricavy; the right to keep something confidental, private, and secret. It is the right to be left alone. It is the right that allows people to be their true selves when left alone. it has been said that privacy is the foundation on which this country was formed. Issues of privacy have gone back to colonial times in this country. People would have to sneak off into the woods or into an open field to chat privately. They could never talk in their crowded homes and towns for fear of eavesdroppers. The Fourth Ammendment states “The right of people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and siezures, shall not be violated, and no warrents shall issue…” Although this is clearly states, privacy have been violated from the very beginning. When in the age of telegraphing, these telegraphs could be interceoted and read very easily. From about 1900 to 1965 when operators had to manually place calls, the opersators could listen in to any conversation and they could tap phone calls with just a clip of a wire. In today’s society, there is no privacy for public figures and celebrities. Photographers snoop through any papers and pictures they can find and go to where they think these people will be just to get a glimpse of them eating a hamburger. These pitures are then published in tabloids and sold all over the country. I believe that the only reason that avergae American, like myself, still has some privacy is only because no one really cares what I’m doing on a day to day basis, whereas the public is very interested if Brad and Angelina are adopting tomorrow. If they did care about what I was doing, it would be easy for them to come to my school and follow me around. Also, because of the recent terrorist attacks, privacy is one of our freedoms that may have to be sacrificed in the near future. For this reason and this reason only, I think it is valid for the government to tap suspicious phone calls and things of that nature. If it is for the safety of the nation, I have no problem giving up this freedom. \n\n",
        "Wow…I have many different feelings on the Operation Iraqi Freedom and the War on Terrorism. In reality, it changes weekly, but I tend to support the war. Yes, I’m sure that everybody reading this hates me now for saying this, but I could care less.\nGoing back to September 11th, it was very reasonable for everyone to support the war. We had been attacked and abused- something that we, the GREATEST country in the world, are not used to. Naturally we want to defend ourselves by eliminating the problem at its roots. It is true that, as the discussion starter says, it was never proven that Saddam had connections with Al Qaeda. The discussion starter has a liberal sense about it tied with a pessimistic view- the way America is acting right now. I feel that this attitude is what got us going in circles…because everyone lost the enthusiasm created after September 11th.\nA country will be a horrible place if its people do not support their leader. Look at Saddam’s Iraq- people were slaughtered every day who did not support his ways. This was truely a Hell hole. People were thrown in meat grinders, etc.- if this isn’t part of Terror, then what it God’s name is?\nI obviously love America, but it pisses me off when people turn their backs away from their leader. Instead of just going against what he/she says, why don’t you try to work with them? Although this is the ideal setting within a country, it can’t work all the time. We as Americans do not know everything that is going on in the world today- even though many of us act as though we do. We feel that if we do research from the media we know a great deal about the war. We don’t. I totally agree with people who say that most of America is swayed in a negative way by the media’s pesimistic view of the war. It eventually gets to people hating a person like Bush (I know, he’s by far not the best leader we’ve had……”BY FAR” I stress) just because thats what they see on T.V. and figure that it must be correct.\nIt puts me to shame that things such as September 11th make us act like true Americans. Now, with the recent shooting at Virginia Tech, people have also come together as a whole through mourning. What’s wrong with this country if we can only be UNITED within the UNITED STATES by a catastrophe?\nIn the end, I feel as though America should support Bush and our efforts in the Middle East. I have talked with soldiers about the topic and they do not feel supported by America’s “pull out of Iraq” view. I feel that this general view looks down upon the soldiers even though they’re apparently supporting the soldiers. All it comes down to is a lot of America doesn’t like Bush- that’s why they want the soldiers out of Iraq. Harsh, I know, but words do tend to come out in an exaggerated sense while writing.\nAs a summary, we know we’re at a stand still- Let’s support Bush and our Soldiers so we can give the country the confidence to get the job done finally and get our amazing soldiers back home… \n\n",
        "I believe that gay marriage should be every bit as legal as straight marriage.  People who argue against gay marriage will say that it will destroy the family unit as we know it.  But what do they mean by “family unit”?  To me, it means a family in which the family members love each other.  I do not think it is centered on the ability of a couple to reproduce.  The idea that marriage exists solely for the purpose of procreation is antiquated.  Several hundred years ago, it was important for a couple to have as many children as possible because they would be able to work on the farms or around the house.  This idea still persists in the minds of those who oppose gay marriage.  Is it not acceptable for a straight couple to choose to not have children?  Of course it is.  Marriage is based on a loving relationship between two adults.\nThe fact of the matter is that homosexuals do exist and will continue to exist for as long as the human race exists.  Why should they be deprived of the right to marry the person they love?  People will claim that homosexuality is a choice that the homosexual person makes.  The Catholic Church even goes so far as to call it a sin.  To this I ask, why would a person choose to be homosexual and put up with all the hardships they have to face every day that straight people simply do not?  Not many, I would think.  And yet there are millions of gay people world-wide.  It almost seems certain that homosexuality is genetic.  It’s just like having red hair or being left handed.  Viewed in this context, it seems barbaric and uncivilized that homosexuals do not have the same rights as heterosexuals.\nI think a homosexual couple is perfectly capable of raising a child in a loving environment.  And if being gay is genetic, people won’t have to worry about a child’s gay parents brainwashing him/her to be gay also.  One hundred years from now, I think we’ll look back and wonder how we could be so foolish and close-minded as to deprive two loving individuals the right to marry. \n\n",
        "The war effort in Iraq wasn’t just a mistake, it was a colossal mistake based upon specious evidence. Many commentators at the beginning of the war posed significant questions about the Bush administrations sources for the evidence they were using to justify an invasion: Were they using information from suspects who had been tortured or had other motivations to lie? To what extent was the belief that Saddam’s regime had WMD’s based upon their mere refusal to cooperate with Un weapons inspectors? Even Colin Powell, after presenting his evidence to the UN Security Council, later stated that he did not find that very same evidence convincing.\nI think it’s pretty clear that this administration came into office with the intent to go to war with Iraq–many insiders have indicated as much–and I think that they had multiple reasons for doing it. 1.) “To make the world safe for democracy.” This is a stupid idea, as proven by much of twentieth century history. The US has intervened in well over twenty countries over the course of the past century as part of efforts to bring democratic stability to those countries. Guess how many now have working democratic governments? None. 2.) “To stabilize the Middle East.” A respectable ambition, but completely destabilizing a regional center isn’t the best way to accomplish it, now is it? 3.) “To create a power vacuum in which the country becomes economically and politically dependent upon the US so that we can export their resources (oil) in ways more economically amenable to ourselves, and provide fringe benefits for large sectors of the US economy (defense contractors).” Oops, did I say that one out loud?\nThis isn’t just a case of bad decision making, this is a case of criminal decision making. It has cost hundreds of thousands of lives with a rationale that can barely be articulated. We’ve made a mess of an important geo-political region, and it’s high time we found a way to begin re-stabilizing that region. Based upon what this administration has done so far, we haven’t been left with many options. \n\n",
        "The discussion starter for privacy rights seems to be different from previous discussions we have had about privacy. Instead of focusing on the internet, we are now focusing on more significant topics where privacy should be a concern. The discussion starter had a few valid points, especially about the privacy of health records. Last month I was in London and read one of the English newspapers. One of the headline stories was of a young woman who was recently diagnosed HIV positive. She had been dating a man for some time and he never told the woman he was HIV positive. To make matters worse, he requested to not use a condom. The woman agreed and lost her virginity to an HIV positive man. This man was of Italian citizenship and immediately fled the country. English officials were able to bring him back to England to face charges. I do not remember what the exact charges were, but his genitals were considered a dangerous weapon. Just as a gun could kill, so could his man parts.\n            I believe that health records should be open to the public in cases like this. Because laws can not always be made for “if this, then that” situations, privacy rights should not be as strict when it comes to health records. This man knew he was HIV positive and would pass on a death sentence because there is still no cure for AIDS.\n            To address some of the other topics- if you do not want companies to give away your personal information, just do not give it to them! I was shopping in the Gap last year when they had a special 15% off for those who joined the Gap club or something like that. I was filling out the required information until the form asked for my social security number. Now, my mother does not give out our home phone number, so I was not about to give out my social security number. Because I did not give the number, I was unable to join the club, but I did what I felt would protect my privacy. We just need to adjust to the way society does things and do what we can to feel safe. \n\n",
        "Have you ever been made fun of or criticized because you were the only boy around or the only girl around? Speaking from experience, it makes someone feel awkward, exposed, and like they do not belong, like they are not good enough. Recently, I was at the FAC late at night to play basketball with a bunch of male friends. We were all excited to play until I entered the gym. It was full of boys, only boys. They began to play without me because they only wanted to play with my male friends. They did not even give me a chance. Just because I was a girl, I was automatically not good enough to play with them or even against them. I felt terrible about myself. However, my male friends stood up for me and said that they would not play unless I could play with them. So, we eventually played against them and won by a landslide, it was almost embarrassing. I felt so great about myself and the friends I had. This experience made me realize that there are still people in our society today that still hold feelings such as these against the opposite sex. But, at the same time, it made me realize that their are people, like my friends, that do not have these feelings, that the world is slowly changing and adapting to this change in society. Women are now equals and have been for a long time. They are getting higher paying jobs and higher educations. They are now becoming mothers and CEO’s. The average age that a woman gets pregnant has went up about six years. This means that women are staying in school longer to receive higher educations. This process of acceptance is still in the works but in a few years, it will eventually pan out. \n\n",
        "Gay marriage is a difficult subject for many people, because there is no way to solve the problem and make everyone happy. I myself am very torn between the two sides because I grew up in a very religious household and was raised on Biblical principles, however, I have made many good friends who are gay and I would want them to be happy. On one hand, there is the Biblical approach to the issue in that many people believe homosexuality is morally wrong. But on the other hand society has come very far from being based on anything remotely Biblical so why not allow gay marriage?\nI do think that the issue of gay marriage should not be one of national concern, but rather of individual states. I do not think the nation government should be allowed to make the decision one way or another since there is so much controversy over the issue. I think doing this would make more people happy and be more accommodating. Also, banning gay marriage or legalizing it altogether would cause chaos and riots in the streets because there are so many people who feel very strongly about both sides of the issue.\nI do not think that procreation is a valid enough reason to band gay marriage. Like the article said, couples who are infertile or past the age of being able to have children are still permitted to marry, so that completely invalidates this reasoning altogether. I do think that if gay marriage is legalized, they should be civil unions and not so much marriage since marriage is defined as the union between a man and woman. Also, because marriage is supposed to be holy union and is recognized as so Biblically and it will be a very difficult task to get many churches to perform marriages between same sexes.\nEven though our society has come very far in broadening its ways of thinking it still has a long way to go. \n\n",
        "I think there is a definite need for the Catholic Church to modernize.  For starters, they should allow women to become priests.  By not doing so, they are sending a message that women aren’t equal to men.  Isn’t one of the central teachings of Jesus that all people are created equal?  Women are perfectly capable of fulfilling priestly duties.  There are numerous Protestant denominations that allow women to become priests, and it seems to work for them.  It is the Church itself that is losing out because it refuses to let women become priests.  What will happen when there aren’t enough male priests?  Such a situation is fast approaching.\nI think one of the reasons why the Church is reluctant to change anything is the fact that it would seem like a sign of weakness.  If the Church has gone on for this long, it might seem like it has made a mistake in not allowing women priests.  The Church really isn’t about admitting mistakes (after all, the pope is infallible, right?).  By just keeping the status quo, the Church can go on thinking that all they do in this world is right.\nI also think the Church should allow priests to marry.  This would attract a large number of young men to the dwindling ranks of priesthood.  The Church will say that priests can devote themselves only to God.  I really don’t think a spouse would detract from their devotion to God.  Again, a lot of Protestant denominations allow their priests to marry, and it seems to work just fine.\nThe Church should definitely change its views on homosexuality.  If homosexuality is indeed genetic, the Church is just discriminating against people who have no control over something.  To call it a sin to be gay is just wrong.  As science advances, so does our knowledge.  The Church should accept this knowledge and change its ways accordingly. \n\n",
        "I think these issues on privacy rights have to be considered on a case by case basis.  It is important to know when people are trying to help you.  For instance, the NSA monitors phone conversations (in Washington, D.C. I think) to help spot terrorism and plans to assassinate the president before they occur.  They have a computerized system that listens for key words like “bomb,” “plane,” etc.  They do not have operators that sit and listen to phone conversations of ordinary citizens.  First of all, there are far to many calls for that to happen, and second of all, the government just doesn’t care about non-threatening phone conversations.  This operation exists because it protects us - not because the government wants to monitor the lives of everyone in the U.S.\nAs far as national ID’s go, I think people will always find ways to beat whatever system is in place.  Even in the age of social security cards, birth certificates, and drivers’ licenses, it is still fairly easy to create a new identity.  Given enough time and money, anyone can make fake ID’s.  People make counterfeit money with very advanced counterfeiting machines despite the best efforts of the Secret Service.  For this reason, I don’t think national ID’s will solve anything (in the long term, at least).\nMedical information is something that needs to be highly protected.  If such information gets into the wrong hands, people can find themselves fighting for their reputations.  If some CEO, for example, contracts HIV, and that information gets out without his consent, his company and his reputation will suffer.  I do think that the system we have set up now is quite adequate - at least in hospitals - to protect people’s medical information.  I work as a hospital pharmacy technician, and only essential medical personnel can view a patient’s medical information.  A patient’s medications are locked away in a drawer in order to prevent privacy violations.\nI think those systems which utilize personal information for the good of the people should be continued, but private information should be highly guarded in all other cases. \n\n",
        "Talking about a national ID system addresses a very tricky subject.  While it could certainly help the government in monitoring for terrorism, it does raise issues of privacy.  Personally, I very much agree with many of the ideas brought up by littlestanemone.  I feel that, as least from my perspective, I am willing to give up some privacy in order to prevent possible future acts of terrorism.  I have nothing to hide from the government, and therefore don’t really mind if someone happens to listen in to a phone conversation, etc.  To me, this partial loss of privacy seems like a small price to pay if, in the long run, doing so could help save the lives of others.  \n            On the other hand, the reality is that the government will not likely be listening to my conversations, as I don’t really fall into a target suspect group.  So although I state that I would give up some privacy, more likely than not, this phone tapping, etc. would not affect me much.  It would, however, affect minority groups, especially those of Middle Eastern descent and thus we have the issue of racial profiling and discrimination.  We have already seen this to be somewhat of a problem with The Patriot Act, with innocent people being investigated and sometimes falsely accused, just because of stereotypes.  \n            This said, I still am in support of a national ID system.  Although it might cause some inconvenience at times, I believe that it could help to better control who enters and leaves our country, as well as help in monitoring people once they are inside the borders.  I do, however, believe that the government will need to use extreme discretion in releasing any information obtained through this system.  It is very important that only necessary government officials have access to this information and that it be used only in an appropriate context of protecting our nation.\n\n\n",
        "Gay marriage seems to be one of the biggest debates these days and I really can’t see why. There are much more important issues at hand, such as the war yet all many people seem to focus on is gay marriage. However, since this topic is on gay marriage I guess I will explain my views.\nIn all honesty I cannot say that it is fair to leave this decision up to the federal government or even the state government. Marriage is a sacrament, not a nation endorsed celebration of the union between two people. With this said I think that it is in our best interest to let the decision making on this topic reside in the church. There is a little something known as “separation of church and state,” which some of these politicians seem to be forgetting. Not all churches will agree on whether gay marriage should be allowed or not and it’s not up to the government to make that decision for them. If it was up to me I would do away with the governments roll in marriage and enact some other kind of civil union that a person must get alongside marriage to be recognized as a couple. Not to be difficult, but just to keep the government out of the church.\nIt could be argued that the government should have some say because there are benefits given to married couples. Come on though, would it really make that much of a difference if a minority of people were allowed to have those same benefits without being spiritually connected to someone of the opposite gender? While of course it would be physically impossible for them to reproduce (at least with our current technology), there is still the option of adoption. They would have the same situation as any heterosexual couple and would deserve all of the same stipulations.\nThen there is the big one. President Bush’s attempt to get a new amendment put in place that specifys marriage as between a man and a woman. Not only is this completely contradictory of another section in the constitution, but it is also a horrific display of his seek for power. If passed, this would be the FIRST amendment to actually RESTRICT THE PEOPLE. The intentions of the constitution as well as the amendments were to prevent the government from infringing on the rights of the people. Now he wants to introduce something that will completely go against everything already said? Something that should NOT happen.\nSo to sum everything up, I am pro-gay marriage as long as the church agrees. Churches should not be forced to ban it nor should they be forced to accept it. However, the overwhelming hype about this subject is just ridiculous. \n\n",
        "It should not be a surprise for me to say that the Iraq war has not turned out like many of us thought, including President Bush.  The objectives were to remove Saddam Hussein (which was accomplished) and eradicate terrorists from Iraq (which was not accomplished).  Like the article stated, terrorists flocked to Iraq from surrounding areas in order to bring the fight to the U.S.  This was undoubtedly a critical oversight by the planners of the war.  However, President Bush, Congress, and the presidential advisors do not have a crystal ball with which to tell the future.  They only have bits and pieces of intelligence from a finite number of sources.  I’m sure they received intelligence that suggested the presence of WMD’s and a link to Al Qaeda.  That does not necessarily mean that such information was accurate.  They decided to invade Iraq because they believed that the danger was too great to ignore.  I cannot fault the decision makers for trying to do their jobs.  Could they have made a huge mistake?  Sure, but who among us does not make mistakes?\nEven though the Iraq war cannot be called a success, some good things were accomplished.  Saddam is dead, his sons are dead, and many Al Qaeda leaders are either dead or imprisoned (i.e. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed).  I don’t think many people understand just how oppressive Saddam’s regime was.  Saddam, whose hero was none other than Joseph Stalin, had close to absolute power over the people of Iraq.  He had an extensive secret police force that he used to snuff out dissent - meaning that whoever publicly opposed him was tortured and/or executed.  Moreover, Saddam has used WMD’s of the chemical variety on the Kurds in the northern part of his own country in the 1980’s when they aided the Iranians in the Iran-Iraq War.  In light of these circumstances, it is clear that Saddam’s regime was intolerable. \n\n",
        "How the hell is gender discrimination any different from ANY kind of racism?  A woman and a man can do the exact same thing.  It drives me crazy when people separate it.  And it happens both ways sadly.  My family is full of stay at home moms, but they would never expect me to stay home just because I’m a woman.  Yet, I’ve seen numerous families where that exact thing happens.  You would never see a father telling his son to stay at home and raise a family.  Countless girls have told me “Oh I’m just in college so I can work until I get married.”  It’s insanity in my mind.\nI get that gender discrimination has been around as long as civilization, but that doesn’t mean we can’t change it.  Just like with any other kind of racism, it can be stopped or at least changed with the effort of man.  We claim as a civilization to be “open-minded” but this just proves that we really aren’t , this is just something we just can’t get rid of.  We can’t get away from the thought that women can only be mothers and wives, or the idea that men have to be the bread winners.  Even today when we routinely have men staying home with the kids and women going into the workplace, it’s not really accepted.  It’s looked at oddly, it’s looked at…as strange, almost as wrong.\nIt’s funny, every time that I tell people that I might never have a family, because I don’t see it fitting in my career plan, I get the oddest looks.  When a man says that he has a career path with no room for a family, he’s looked at as a driven young man ,and a woman is looked at as an oddity.  Scares the crap outta me. \n\n",
        "According to the discussion starter, it sounds reasonable that marriage between a man and a woman be for procreation purposes. I have been taught that men and women are meant to marry under a religious ceremony and procreate. To me, marriage has always been the cover for having kids. When I imagine myself in twenty years, I envision myself as the mother of five kids. I can’t imagine being married or what my spouse will look like. In today’s age, people usually marry because they are in love or strongly attracted to another person. Sometimes the idea of a family does not even cross the couples mind when they are married- the family becomes just the two of them.\n            With this change in people’s desires for a family, there has also been a change in the validity of the definition of marriage. Marriage is no longer a way to procreate, but a way to express commitment to the one person you (hopefully) truly love. For this reason, I believe that same sex marriages should be allowed. If a man and woman can be married for reasons other then procreation, then a woman and woman and man and man should have equal rights. Same sex partners can procreate through artificial insemination or even adopt together. I believe we should give all people a chance to form a family.\n            I want same sex marriage to be legalized, but at the same time do not agree with the last paragraph in the discussion starter. I do not think that the legalization of same sex marriage will encourage same sex partners to settle down with one partner and form a family. I believe that these are peoples own choices and this new option will not change them. If partners want to settle down and have children, then they will, with or without the legalization of marriage. Marriage is just a title. \n\n",
        "In my big-mouthed, pretentious opinion, the global “war on terror” is one of the most ill-conceived political notions I’ve ever heard of. It was a hasty response to America’s post-9/11 fears, and was meant to restore faith in the U.S. government at a time when people felt it had failed. They wanted to give us something to rally around in a time of crisis. September 11th truly hit home for us; for the first time since the cold war, Americans felt tangibly affected by political crisis. The “war on terror” was a vague, half-assed response to this.\nWhat exactly is “terror”? Exactly what, and who, are we fighting against? What does terror look like? Does it always wear a turban? Does it always have distinguishable qualities? Is it just an emotion, or is it embodied by specific people? A war against the dictionary definition of “terror” (an emotion) would be fought by psychiatric professionals, right? The fatal ambiguity of our “war on terror” is that IT MAY ONLY EXIST AS A SECONDARY CONCEPT, WE MUST FIRST DEFINE TERROR!!\nSo who gets to define terror? Obviously somebody messed up when they defined “terror” as “Iraq”. Obviously, the executive branch had an agenda in mind before it even looked at its intelligence data, and it interpreted all such data accordingly. The entire intelligence community, as those who often take the fall for ill-decisions at the top, must have been really pissed off when those at the top IGNORED intel conclusions that Iraq disequals Al-Quaeda.\nWe aren’t talking about some chickenshit political fiasco, we are talking about the ENTIRE military and economic might of one of the greatest countries in the world. If we are going to fling that muuch power around, we BETTER know EXACTLY who, what, where, when, why, and how its going to happen, or else the international community will decapitate our legitimacy. The war on terror simply does NOT, and has NOT, satisfied these things. \n\n",
        "In my opinion, the war in Iraq has gone on for way too long.  It scares me to think that more troops are being sent over, when we should instead be working on a way to pull out of Iraq.  The question of what exactly that exit strategy should be is a very difficult one.  On the one hand, I would love to see all of our soldiers come back home safely now.  But on the other hand, as much as I don’t believe in the way in which this war was started, I also don’t believe that it would be right for us to just leave right now.  The situation is such a mess right now because of what we initiated, and I feel that it would be wrong of us to leave after completely upsetting whatever political structure Iraq had in the first place.  Since we started this, we have a certain obligation to “clean up after ourselves” and at least try to restore some order.  However, I also feel that what we need to do in not take Iraq by the hand and wait patiently as it takes every little baby step.  We need to just finish our business over there in as efficient and timely a manner as possible and get out once we have done this.\n \nIn response to the discussion starter’s mention of the war in Iraq in relation to the war on terrorism, I am part of the 57% of Americans who feel that the Iraq War is not part of the War on Terror.  The war in Afghanistan was a direct retaliation against the attack of September 11th, 2001, but I believe that to try to make a direct connection between 9/11 and Iraq is not correct.  After our nation was attacked on September 11th, it would have been very strange of us not to have some sort of a response; this response was the war in Afghanistan and the attempt of find Osama bin Laden.  When Bush extended this fight against terrorism to Saddam and Iraq, he was simply playing off the fear instilled in Americans by the events of 9/11. \n\n",
        "           I agree with many of the ideas stated in the previous two posts.  In regards to laws about gay marriage basically what I think is, “Who are we to decide that two people who love each other can not get married?”  I don’t think that there is any legitimate argument for banning gay marriage.  What right does the government have to make such a law?  I like the analogy brought up about comparing this situation to banning left-handed people from operating a forklift.\n            Some of the arguments that I have heard against gay marriage seem to confuse a legal marriage with a church marriage.  If someone gets married in the Catholic Church, for example, they obtain a civil marriage license and ALSO go through a certain process within the Church.  While the Church might have its own reasons for not allowing homosexuals to marry within the Church, I see no reason why the couple should be denied a civil marriage.   As stated, the decisions of a specific religious group “have no proper bearing on the law.”  I definitely feel that this is one area where religious opponents of gay marriage have faulty logic: they confuse the idea of the sacrament of marriage with the legal right to marry.\n            With all of this talk about marriage, we must ask ourselves why people get married.  It is possible to live together and/or to have children without being married, so why do people get married??  I think that one reason is that in marrying someone, you are saying that you love them so much that you are willing to commit yourself to a lifelong relationship with them.  I believe that if two people, heterosexual or homosexual, are so  much in love that they are willing to make this serious a commitment, as an outsider to their relationship, I have no right at all to tell this couple that they can not enter into this union.   \n\n",
        "First of… who in the world declared this as a war!!! Bush is using the war in iraq as a way to benefit himself. Imagine if even after he has left office Iraq is on the way to becoming a democratic country! He would have full bragging rights in saying that he started it, and it was in his doing that and “declaring” the war on terror and bringing Iraq into the picture that they are a democratic state. And also America being the selfish place that it is, wants to democratize Iraq so as to keep their source of oil within their reach.\n \n“Bush supporters say its better to fight terrorists in Iraq than in the USA,” wow this statement took me by surprise. I suspect that if these people support Bush then they are supporting his idea of democratizing Iraq and building a new country. So has does that happen with continued fighting in Iraq? Granted most of the fighting is only taking place in a few areas and isn’t as countrywide as the media leads us all to believe but still how can a country grow if its getting constantly setback by bombings.\n \nWow!! Gobigdonny has but everything that I would feel about the war if I actually knew a sufficient amount of information into my own words. I was one of those people who after 9/11 was so exited to go over to Iraq and whop some Iraqi ass but that’s all I  knew about the war. And that’s what the government fed off of when 9/11, they thought we normally might not have everyone’s support but because people are angry we will definitely have it now to go over to Iraq and basically tear down all their establishments and start over. So they can build a little “America” in Iraq. \n\n",
        "            One of the main issues with privacy rights is why people want certain information to remain confidential.  If they have nothing to hide, people are generally unconcerned by privacy issues, because there will be no consequences if others find out their personal information.  Still, some people are bothered by the fact that private information could become available to certain people who could use the information against them.  The best example of this is medical privacy, and people’s desire to keep medical records secure so that employers do not discriminate against them.  The same issue persists with genetic privacy and possible discrimination by employers.\n            There are these disadvantages such as employment discrimination associated with the collection of private data.  It is important, however, to remember, that employment discrimination is a misuse, or even abuse, of this collected data.  Data collection is not intended to enable discrimination of the workplace.  That is merely a negative consequence that comes along with the collection of personal information for worthwhile purposes.  Therefore, it is not fair to blame the process of personal information collection for the ways in which the information it gathers is misused.  There is nothing wrong with collecting data for useful purposes, but rather when it is used in ways that were not intended, such as for discriminating against possible employees based on their medical histories.\n            In fact, the collection of personal information can be quite useful, especially in keeping terrorist attacks from happenings.  In an age where national security is particularly important, we should be compliant with measures that are intended to protect us.  Recorded communication, for example, can be helpful in foiling terrorist plots, and being willing to have phone conversations recorded, emails tracked, and letters followed could help keep the nation secure from terrorist actions.  Doing so is particularly important in today’s day and age, where there are many more terrorist plans against the United States than its citizens are even aware of, because many are thwarted before they reach the public, thanks to the aid of the collection of private information.  As long as safeguards are taken against its misuse, the collection of information for uses in nation security should continue. \n\n",
        "i agree with both sides of the argument in that I understand why heterosexuals find it hard to accept or tolerate the idea of gay marriage. but i feel that what they fail to realize is the homosexuals arguement that many homosexuals would not be on such a sexual rampage if they had the opportunity to settle down. I mean think how many families would be there to adopt all of the foster children and provide them with a family. Also I feel that what people dont recognize is that a marriage has nothing to do with a man and a woman in the dictionary a marriage is clearly defined as a union between two people who share a sexual and domestic relationship and live within the same household. I dont understand why heterosexuals feel so against gay marriage because of the idea that they cant make children naturally. If you think about neither can a man who has a low sperm count neither can a woman who has sterile eggs. Invetro-fertilization and sperm banks were made so people who weren’t born with the natural ability to reproduce could have that chance. \n\nShakespeare said, “Would a rose but my any other name still smell as sweet.” I believe the problem with allowing gay people to marry is because of the title marriage. Because our country is run by people who based their whole lives on the Bible they can’t help but be uncomfortable with the title gay marriage. I also feel that gay people are mainly looking at the benefits that are received in the title of marriage. If they allowed the title civil union and still set in the benefits of marriage, I believe everything will be a little better.\nAlso I feel that the government is looking to indepthly at the situation of marriage. They are trying to look at all these different angles of what marriage is and all I think they should be focused on is that it is a union between two people. And even though homosexual couples can’t have biological children, there are many ways to still have children, in-vitro-fertilization, having sex with a man, and adoption. Our government is so stuck on preserving the natural roots of marriage that they struggle to accept that there may be a different kind of love between two people of the same sex.\n\n\u001a",
        "            First of all, there are a number of reasons that may have motivated the United States Government to proceed with Operation Iraqi Freedom.  One of the biggest reasons that Bush often talked about was Saddam Hussein’s possession of weapons of mass destruction.  Of course, no such weapons were ever found.  And at that time other countries like North Korea openly admitting possessing and developing such nuclear weapons.  Was the U.S. government blinded by the oil in Iraq perhaps?  Some critics say that Bush had some sort of personal agenda in trying to do what his father did not, that is, remove Saddam from power when he had the chance at the end of the 1st Gulf War.  And of course, as the discussion starter explains, many government officials and American citizens believed in 2003 that the invasion of Iraq was part of the War on Terrorism.\n            It seems to appear that Operation Iraqi Freedom has created more terrorists.  By removing the Iraqi government, the U.S. created a power vacuum from which chaos ensued.  Without a feasible plan to combat such conditions, the country, 4 years later, is still plagued by rival religious and cultural factions and Iraqi citizens and U.S. soldiers alike live in terror.  If nothing else, this war has incited more animosity against the U.S., among more then those directly affected in Iraq.  By invading Iraq, the U.S. ignored the decision of the United Nations, an international peace-keeping body whose success relies upon the cooperation of its members.  Such an action seems to contradict the image that the United States makes for itself, that of leader of the free world and great example for other nations, and it has also alienated several former allies.\n            I don’t believe that the United States government had a legitimate reason to invade Iraq.  However, now that we have spent 4 years disrupting their country and turning it upside down, I do not think that it would be fair to the Iraq people if we leave them in a state of chaos and warfare.  It will take a long time to repair the state of Iraq, much longer than most people realized when they supported the war in 2003.  Democracies are not built overnight, and it takes even longer for them learn how to function adequately.  If we look at our own country’s history, almost 100 years after the writing of the Constitution, the United States was still divided with Americans fighting fellow Americans.  How could we possibly have expected it to be any easier in Iraq? \n\n",
        "The issue of privacy is a very important one to our society as the line between what is and is not acceptable has gotten increasingly blurred. In most cases, I think that everyone is entitled to privacy and to disclose only the information they feel comfortable with. However, if this information is harmful to them or other people, I think they have no right to with hold information. In the case of the woman who unknowingly contracted AIDS from the man who’s intention was to infect her, I definitely think that the man’s medical records should not be kept confidential and should be used against him. He was obviously using his disease as a weapon and had little regard for other people.\nIn the cases where genetic discrimination occurred, I think it was unethical for employers and insurance companies to look at people’s medical records. In this case, having a problem genetically is no one else’s business, especially if it is not harmful to anyone else. These people were treated unfairly based on something they have no control over. By invading their privacy, they were discriminated against in the same way many people are based on race or religion. Medical records are supposed to be kept confidential and by looking into them, businesses are completely disregarding personal space and rights. This should only be allowed with the consent of the person they are looking to investigate and whatever they find should not influence their opinions of the person one way or another.\nI feel like these days so many people are just out to use your personal information against you, you can’t really trust anyone with your information. Even for my job, we are told to try and get donations on credit cards rather than through mailings because it’s less of a hassle. However, many people are reluctant to give out their credit card numbers because of the risk and vulnerability you set yourself  up for. And any information given to us is completely safe and secure, but many people are distrusting because it seems only bad things happen when you give out your personal information. I think that businesses and even the government need to learn to keep their noses out of the things that do not concern them; if no ones life is in danger, then they have no right to anyones personal information without their consent. \n\n",
        "From participating in this study I have learned a few things about the war in Iraq and various individuals’ opinions on the war. Yet, even with this knowledge, I am still much uninformed. I may be uninformed about the war because it never had an immediate impact on me, and therefore I did not take an interest in following the headlines. When I think about the war in these terms I feel that we are taking the right course of action by having our troops in the Middle East. I would prefer the fighting to be kept off of our land and away from our homes and loved ones. When I place myself in the shoes of those whose loved ones are fighting, I have a very different feeling. If my brother or someone I loved was fighting in the war, I would want President Bush to bring the troops home IMMEDIATELY. So, my opinion on the war changes depending on the impact it has on my family and I.\n            My friend John attends West Point Academy; after his four years of college he will serve five years, most likely somewhere in the Middle East. I have known John for many years and I can not imagine him at war, I can not even imagine him holding a gun. When I talk to John, he never complains, saying he chose to be in the military and will go wherever they place him. John rarely tells people that he attends West Point because he fears how some people will react to him. He fears a person’s response to his chosen occupation, but does not fear going to war. I may not know everything about the war and the issues surrounding the topic, but I do know that a person in the military should never have to hesitate or dread telling someone they are in the military or training to be in the military.\n            Concerning the war in Iraq, I think that to an extent society has lost track of their priorities. Instead of condemning the war and those fighting, we should be fully supportive of all those who are there to protect us. People should be able to have their own opinions about the war, but I do not think they should cast doubt on those fighting in the war. \n\n",
        "Let’s clarify something, first off. “Feminism” as a theoretical designation and a movement, is a very vague term that encompasses a diverse range of beliefs and ideas. When I simply say “feminist,” I could just as easily be talking about the aesthetics of Heidi Gottner-Abendroth as the renegade social commentary of Camille Paglia, which are very, very different things. Many types of feminist theory are still prominent in academic circles, however, and have a significant role to play (Elaine Showalter’s art historical work is a good example). My point in all of this is that we have to be careful how we bandy that term about; to reduce “feminism” to a Rosy the Riveter “We can do it!” mentality that a bunch of women had in the 60s is a vast oversimplification.\nAnyway, I don’t think that gender-based discrimination is still a huge problem in the United States. I think that there are still some areas of life where it remains a significant obstacle, however, and those aren’t necessarily all directly related to the workplace. The prompt describes the way in which many women feel compelled to leave home for the work place, or feel compelled to stay home to raise children. This is an internal conflict many (or even most) women still experience, and is the result of millennia of social attitudes that advocate that they should have a particular role to play. Whether or not these attitudes were unfair, considering their context, is one thing; the fact that they persist is unfair, however. How many women do you think are made to feel like bad mothers for leaving their children at daycare? By comparison, how many fathers do you think are made to feel like bad parents for doing the same? (Answer: many, and probably not many). This is the result of age-old ideas about gender roles we still maintain. Feminism wasn’t just concerned with changing the role of women in society; it was concerned with changing attitudes like these, which is why it persists and is still pertinent.\n\n",
        "            The war in Iraq may have started out as a controversial issue, but it is quickly becoming more controversial as the United States maintains its presence there, and even increases the amount of troops it sends.  Some of the causes of this controversy are the tolls of war on the American people, the unclear purpose of the war, and the ultimate goals for the Iraqi people.\n            An obvious source of opposition to the war is the cost to the American people.  As the United States sends more and more troops to fight in the war, the number of families being split up and soldiers dying increases.  War takes a physical toll in the number of people it kills, as well as an emotional toll in the number of people it affects.  No one wants to see these negative effects of war, so it is no wonder that the movement in opposition to the war has gathered more energy as the war has picked up and its negative consequences are more apparent.\n            People are likely to support the war, despite its negative effects, if the advantages outweigh the detriments.  The problem, however, lies in determining the advantages to the war in Iraq, because the purpose of the United States there is so unclear.  It is hard to rationalize the cost of war without recognizing progress towards the war’s goals.  Since the goals are so ambiguous and unknown to the American people, the disadvantages of the war take the stage in the forefront of the American mind.\n            While the goals for the war are largely unclear, it has been suggested that power will eventually be given to the Iraqi people.  Just how this will play out is difficult to determine.  The American people have not been told clearly how the transition in power will take place, and it is hard to place faith in something that has not been entirely explained or supported.  It sounds like a great idea in theory, but may not actually work in practice.\n            The war is becoming harder and harder to support as more Americans are affected, and few goals are realized.  Perhaps the war would gain more support if the government were more explicit in stating their goals and intentions for the Iraqi people. \n\n",
        "While it isn’t nearly as apparent as it was around 50 years ago, Gender Discrimination still does exist. While there have been many laws created to try and eliminate it and our culture has grown more gender-tolerant, there still lives this tendency to discriminate on a sex basis in the mind. As little kids we are bombarded with insults such as, “John plays baseball like a girl!” This is harmless enough on the surface, but when we are constantly reminded that “girls aren’t as good at baseball as guys,” it must have SOME sort of impact on the way we think in the future. Fair enough, as we grow older we drop some of these silly ideas and begin to look at things the way they are, but still there lingers this idea in the back of our minds.\nI have never been to fond of sports myself so I could not accurately say that “male basketball players are much tougher than women basketball players” but I can say that I’ve heard similar remarks made. Sure, they could just be sly remarks that one male will make to another seeking a resulting laughter, but all in all it is still one way that we can see some sort of discriminating. Just the fact that there is some motive for that remark to be made in relation to gender is enough to show it. A similar issue would be these gender jokes. I hang out with pleanty of guys, and enough guys to have heard a couple dozen women jokes. I can’t say that I’m innocent and have never told one either. Though most people do not tend to think much of what they are saying when they tell them, but are really just looking for a few cheap laughs, these images can be disturbing.\nLooking past the non-physical level of discrimination and on to something jobs, we are presented with another problem. There are more and more women getting out into the workplace alongside men, which is good, but there are still statistics out there that show that there is discrimination with pay, positions and other things, whathaveyou. Many of these companies are run by old white men waving flags for the Republican party’s darker side. Hopefully at this rate these tyrants will soon be out of power and a newer more tolerant generation will be running the businesses. Many of the people in the higher ranks now still have the image of the stereotypical 1950’s family in their minds. Wife in the home, husband at work.\nHow about discrimination towards men? Most people would scoff at this question. It isn’t nearly as big of a problem as it is towards women, but it is out there. There are a handful of women who think of all men as ungreatful swine who are the bane of humanity. Then there are stereotypical images of men that some women carry. One of these images is of a man sitting on a couch with a beer in his hand and the football game on. Not all men are like that, obviously, but just like the stereotypes exsist for women, they also exist for men.\nSo all in all, yeah, gender discrimination does still exist. Not always towards women, but moreso than it is towards men. It is improving, thankfully, but it still has a long way to go. Not all of the change is in the realm of physical objects. For the most part what we need to change is our own mindset.\nOver and out. \n\n",
        "The Catholic Church should recognize that the world is changing and they should change with it because whether they want to realize it or not the older generation is dying off and the new generation is a sex-crazed generation. We’ve grown up with sex; sex has gotten to the point that it’s even in g-rated movies. Also the whole notion of women not being allowed to be priests is another reason why they are having so much trouble, I mean why are they keeping women subordinate to men, these aren’t the old days, women can be as great of a priest as men can. Hardly anyone is going to want to be a priest if they can’t have sex; it’s gotten to a point that we are expected to have sex at some point in our lives whether we want to start it at an early age or wait until we are married.\n \nAlso I understand what the rest of the reading is saying but they also don’t want to lose a valued numbered of priests and parishioners all because the church wants to be stuck in their traditions. Maybe if they waited a little to make sure that it’s not a growing trend across the country and the world. Because what many seem to forget is that Catholicism isn’t just here, it’s all over the world so we have to look at the fact that our younger generation may be changing but others may not. I feel the church also needs to target the youth, a lot of catholic sermons are very dry and uneventful, not to say that they need to be as exciting as Baptist churches but the reason so many people get into Baptist sermons are because they are speaking on issues that affect their parishioners in their everyday life.\n\n",
        "Gender discrimination has become one of the most troubling issues of the 19th and 20th centuries. In America, we have come far in many ways to lessen the tension between the two sexes. In other countries, the gap between men and women is much wider. This is based upon social ideals and traditions in these cultures.\nThe feminists of our time, although not battling the same issues as those who came before them, are fighting very important battles. In some workplaces, women are still not shown the same respect as their male coworkers. The equal pay for equal jobs idea is not always followed, especially in some high level jobs. Women are also currently fighting over the idea of abortion. There are groups of women who believe that they should have the right to decide, pro-choice, for whether or not they would like an abortion. These women believe that it should not be up to the government to make decisions about their bodies.\nThis discrimination is not just limited to women. The stay at home men of our time are becoming more and more prevalent in society. These men, often referred to as “Mr. Mom” are the stay at home “mothers” of the 21st century. No longer is it seen as ridiculous for a woman to be the one to go off to work. Also, men are discriminated against in the way that they look at women. Often, as a group, being called “sexist” or “pigs” men seem to be accused of many faults towards women in general.\nIn many aspects of life, gender discrimination has come very far within the last century. It is no longer seen as absurd that a woman can vote, or hold a job. Although there are still some areas to be conquered, and we could never change the personal views of every person, Americans have come very far in closing the gap between genders. \n\n",
        "I agree with clockwatcher555 that allowing women to become priests will not solve all of the Catholic Church’s problems, but I disagree on principle. They cite tradition as one of the reasons the Church has to be careful in changing things around – I think tradition needs to be reevaluated n its importance.\nThere is something to be said for the stability of religion, how it can remain constant from year to year even when major events are changing the face of the world. People rely on religion for unchanging morals and beliefs in an unstable world, and that is as it should be. Tradition is a huge part of religion’s foundation, and is integral to most of the laws and practices of any religion, not just Catholicism. However, when traditions are followed blindly out of habit rather than for the value they add to the religious experience, they become a burden and cloud the real purpose of the faith.\nI think the major crisis in the Catholic Church today is that many of its traditions have become so ingrained that they are vehemently defended even when they no longer make sense. The case of women not being allowed to be priests is a good example of this. Any argument the can be made for keeping women out of the priesthood has its basis in the tradition of the Catholic Church – that’s the way it’s been done for 2000 years, Jesus never had women apostles, popes throughout the years have always banned women from priesthood. However, these traditions were founded in a society so much different from ours today that it can hardly be compared. Middle-eastern, patriarchal, and placed 2000 years in history, it is amazing that most of the traditions and practices of the Church have stayed so intact. Perhaps it is time for tradition to get a rational review from an outside perspective.\nThat being said, I don’t think we should just throw out traditions that clash with the values of our society. Frogger428 is completely right, the Catholic Church doesn’t just exist in America. “Catholic” itself means universal – the Church has branches in every continent. Before we can say “this should change!”, we must have a general consensus and listen to all sides of the story. \n\n",
        "as a roman catholic, the updating of the catholic church is an issue that hits close to home.  while i don’t plan on becoming a priest, it is obvious that the matters mentioned concerning the eligibility and conditions of the priesthood have consequences to any Catholic, as Boston unfortunately found out in the awful way it did.\nfirst off, i don’t see anything wrong with letting priests marry or allowing women to become priests.  the reasons given below my post are at least on the right track; if not i agree with them completely.  the idea of the priest being “married to church” and therefore not allowed to have a wife has become viewed as antiquated and (despite many centuries of priests being able to conduct their duties fine celibate) the more i truly think about the argument, the more i agree with the reformers. allowing women to become priests just makes sense: the gender issue is definately outdated and in the (relatively) equal society between men and women we live in today there is no legitimate reason to keep a woman from joining the priesthood.\nassuming that the church eventually does update itself on these two matters, it would be interesting to speculate what order it does update.  based on my understanding, i would assume woman priests would be admitted before any priest was allowed to marry: even a celibate woman priest would still be “married to the church”.\nfinally, i think that the ending points of the starter post are very relevent and well put.  any time an influential institution that people base their beliefs off like the Church changes its doctrines, the change needs to be well thought out.  the institution does not even need to be religious; we can see similar parrellels with the controversy of president bush attempting to amend the constitution on the issue of gay marriage. \n\n",
        "Gay marriage should absolutely be allowed and people, in general, should strive to have an open mind on the subject.  It is very easy for people, especially when they do not realize they are doing it, to make a judgment on an issue based on the norm.  People naturally resist change and since this topic has been dormant for so long, people have not thought about it.\nIf people were to truly open their minds up on the topic and apply thought to it, the argument for gay marriage is not that difficult.  One argument may be that it deviates from the “natural purpose” of marriage.  Well, once more, natural purpose is something that has been defined by man, just as the institution of marriage.  As long as people, afraid of change, are creating the definitions, then certainly it will be difficult to allow same-sex marriages.\nWhile parents consisting of two men or two women would be obviously different then a man and a woman, there is no saying one is better than the other.  The problem, once more, is that people are used to a majority of parents being the traditional man and woman.  However, I would argue that one of the most important factors in a successful family life is love, and if someone who is gay is forced, by society, to marry someone of the opposite sex, true love will not be accomplished.  Without that true love, the child may have greater problems because he or she did not grow up in a loving environment.\nWhile religion will most likely stubbornly compete to keep gay marriage out of practice, the governments should enact gay marriage laws making it legal.  The government is merely present to protect the rights of the citizens and tends to overstep its bounds.  In this case, the people should have the right to marry as they please, without any sort of governmental obstacles.\n\n",
        "Homosexuality is a lifestyle that is up and coming in our society today. People, especially in areas such as New York City, are used to seeing same sex couples walking around, kissing, holding hands, and hugging. For some, these kinds of acts are viewed as unholy, not right, weird, gross, and just not the norm. Others, however, see no problem with how homosexuals act in public, they believe that it is their choice, their life. For me, I am in the middle on this issue. I do believe that it is their choice and their life to do what they want, however, I am not keen on even having heterosexual couples displaying their affection for each other in public. I just think it makes everyone else around them uncomfortable. I think this issue of same sex couples is one that is like gender issues, as time passes, it will become more normal and more accepted. We cannot expect our society that has been viewing heterosexual couples as the norm for thousands of years to just change. Because I went to Catholic school for most of my life, I have seen many people disapprove of this behavior. I know that this is the church’s view on the issue of homosexuality, however, the church does not have the last word in every issue. It does not always have to make the final judgment on what is right and what is wrong. However, when speaking about gay marriage, I believe that the church’s opinion does matter. Marriage is a sacred sacrament that has been in the Catholic religion since the beginning. If gay couples want to be recognized as a couple by the state, that is fine. However, they have to realize that they will never be recognized by the church as a couple because homosexuality is against Catholic beliefs. They cannot expect the church to change it’s views on this issue so drastically. Over time, I think, the Church might warm up to the idea because it will become such a norm ion society, but that will not be for a long while. \n\n",
        "The Christian bible has a great number of stories which contain moral lessons, and as such, it is a valuable book to study. After reading the bible, we are supposed to love our neighbors, understand each other, be generous, act with love, and in turn, address many of society’s ills. While the Church has provoked a great deal of human suffering over the years, these lessons have also inspired a lot of good. The lessons in the bible are implicit, however, rather than explicit, and in the process of interpretation, they are all too often lost. Today, opportunistic post-Constintinian Christian politicians use their “convictions of faith” as a tool to increase their “appeal” to “faithful” voter populations. They hawk their “views” on issues such as abortion and gay marriage in exchange for single-issue “moral” votes. In turn, they try to polarize discourse over these issues into those “for” and those “against” the church, while not publically calling attention to MUCH MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES (global warming, petroleum dependency, etc). This is the sad state of affairs to which American Christianity has been reduced: a coercive marketing tool that drives our political machine toward polarized paralysis and drives ordinary citizens to clash with each other, sometimes violently.\nI know that the Church wants to provide static traditions which do not die/change over time. Such consistency is a NOBLE goal. However, the world is constantly changing. Humanity is currently faced with an apocalyptic global warming crisis, terrifying global power-money politics, institutionalized racism, perpetual wars, suffering, and death. In order for the Church to retain any of my respect, IT NEEDS TO MAKE ADDRESSING THESE THINGS ITS FIRST PRIORITY. With more than just a papal bull or two, with overwhelming cries for social justice in a world which has left justice behind. If the Church doesn’t act to proliferate good in the world, it has lost sight of its original mission.\nIn terms of self-preservation, if the Church wishes to be a viable entity in contemporary America, it can’t cling to its antiquated views. I, like Frankie, do not care what the Church does. However, if the Church still wants to be around, it might have to stop being so stubborn… or else it will lose touch with many of its followers (cafeteria catholics etc). \n\n",
        "Different CULTURES gradually define which attitudes they will or won’t accept. Things like sex, gender roles, education, work ethic, marriage, etc. are esteemed differently in different societies. Such attitudes are subject to change, however, especially when empowered groups of citizens put forth an effort to change them.\nDuring World War II (and into the cold war), the prevailing American family image was that of the “nuclear family”. Society more or less MANDATED (at least for suburbanized white people) that fathers be breadwinners, mothers stay at home and bear 2.4 children, and people marry early for security (from those damn reds). Anyone who strayed (by not marrying, divorcing, etc) was estranged and labeled “outsider”. These “American” values were reinforced by mass media (i.e. popular mechanics vs. redbook), and most people attempted to pass them on to their children. In short, these people endorsed and strengthened the imposition of traditional gender roles. Women gradually grew dissatisfied with this setup, however, as their true potential was often underutilized in the housewife role.\nBetty Friedan’s book “The Feminist Mystique” pretty much spells it all out. Friedan, in an admirably brave fit of non-conformism, provided hundreds of airtight arguments AGAINST the prevailing gender roles which American society imposed. Her “activism” mirrored other “activism” which was simultaneously going on, against Viet Nam, against drug laws, against parents, and pretty much against everything “societal” (i.e. hippies). This is an example of the “empowered citizens” I was talking about before.\nI think it was only a matter of time before women broke out of arbitrary gender inequities. Unfortunately, like racism, gender inequity hasn’t fully been purged from our society, despite the efforts of many. However, the wage gap is closing, and women are breaking out of the house to work in droves.\nWhat does trouble me is that a culture of “having kids early” exists disproportionately more in impoverished areas, putting stress on already broken public institutions (public schools, etc), and already depressed financial situations. Thats pretty bad. I think I hit 300 words now so I’m gonna end this here and go get my money. \n\n",
        "I constantly am in debate about how I feel about gay couples. I would never hate anyone for being gay, nor would I praise them for it. I would never look down upon the lifestyle, but I’ll never support it either. I know gay people, and I am also starting to see it more and more on T.V. For instance, there are gay couples on those dumb dating shows on places like MTV. While I respect gay people, there’s no way I can watch them kiss or show any other type of intimacy in anything- like movies, shows, etc.\nNow even though I can’t watch that stuff doesn’t mean I’ll treat those people differently. It is for this reason that I see hope for these gay couples that want to be united with each other. To bring the church into the picture is stupid- stop doing that. Change the stupid name to a “civil union,” don’t call it a marriage, and you’re done. If these people want to be recognized within the church, then that’s their problem to personally deal with. Even if the church is against gays, I know priests that are all for it. After all, these gay people aren’t going to be going to the Pope for mass every sunday…\nA marriage is a union within the church between a man, woman, and God. That’s not my opinion, thats what it is. Let it stay in the church…I think that everyone who plans on staying together forever should be united under the law to get the government to recognize the union. Everyone would be united, but only the few that fall under the Church would be married. What’s the big deal? The people who want to be “married” and recognized by the church need to stop complaining. Some may also say that if the gay couples aren’t “married” then they would be treated differently in a negative sense. In one way, shape, or form, they will always be treated differently- or at least for a loooooooooooong time. After all, what they feel is not normal (by that I mean not even close to the majority of people)\nAs for the government, it has no place telling people what to feel or what and what they can’t do based in this field. Who do they think they are? if they think it’s morally wrong, then don’t talk to the people and stay within whatever group you’re in that doesn’t like it- but don’t go out of your way to discriminate against them, etc., etc.\nCivil Unions are fine, but leave marriages to the church… \n\n",
        "When discussing the issue of privacy rights, one must first define both parts of the dichotomy that is the idea of information with permissions, namely the terms of public information and private information.  Public information represents the realm of information corresponding to that which is public, or accessible to all people, with no prerequisites attached to grant permission to access that information.  If anyone were to enter information into this realm, the information would be deemed public, meant for anyone’s eyes, for anyone to achieve without any prior permission.  On the other hand, private information represents the realm of information corresponding to that which is private, or accessible only to a select few, chosen by the party presenting the current information.  If anyone were to enter information into this realm, the information would be deemed private, meant for the eyes of the select few, chosen by the party presenting the current information, for anyone to achieve who has prior permission.\nNow possessing these definitions, we can begin to evaluate the legitimacy of information based solely on which realm it is taking from.  For information that derives from the realm of public information, that information can be legitimately used by anyone for just means.  Online forums, such as a public MySpace, fall into this realm of information.  If anyone were to collect any information about anyone on a public MySpace, that information could be used against that person for just means.  For information that derives from the realm of private information, that information must be discarded and branded as illegitimate by origin.  Private online forums, such as Facebook, fall into this realm of information.  No one outside the specified group on Facebook can legitimately use any information attained on Facebook against the person who the information is about.\nAs one would probably guess, such a clear-cut view of public information and private information may cause a problem to arise when the issue of privacy rights becomes a balancing act between the right of an individual to maintain privacy to some degree and the necessity of using private information to prevent a potentially dangerous situation.\n\n",
        "Okay, I’d like to clarify something before I go forward. Everyone harps on the idea of “papal infallibility” as being one of the most ridiculous things the Catholic Church ever dreamed up (and it very well might be), but it’s frequently misunderstood and misrepresented. Papal infallibility is a doctrine that can only be invoked in regards to a point of theological dogma. If the Pope said, “The Yankees are a really good baseball team,” he’d obviously be wrong. From what I remember from my days in high school theology class, the doctrine of papal infallibility has only been invoked twice, on two specific, separate issues.\nThat said, I agree with Mtnbike9 on all of his points below. I have an uncle who is a Catholic priest, and know for a fact that many priests are under specific orders to stay quiet about any or all of those issue that were raised. We have to remember that the Catholic Church doesn’t just exist in America; it’s ruled by a hierarchical system who’s top is located on another continent. The social attitudes and ideas one finds in America don’t necessarily hold true in the rest of the world, and certainly don’t hold true in Vatican City. I think that this is one of the biggest reasons the Church hasn’t (and probably won’t, at least for a while) made any major changes in the way they go about their business.\nI think that the Catholic Church stands to lose a huge amount of its members in the United States. According to a 2002 poll, about 23% of US adults identify themselves as Catholic (that’s a much larger portion than I would have guessed). We can probably expect this number to drop steadily over the next couple decades as more and more people seek what they feel to be less restrictive forms of Christianity. That is, unless the Church decides to change.\n\n",
        "Gender discrimination is still a problem in the world today, but has decreased significantly over the past few decades.  There is still the fact that in scientific studies, some companies will more often hire someone with a gender neutral name like Sam or Casey than someone with a clearly feminine name like Maryanne, and how on average women are paid 70 cents to a man’s dollar.  However, any companies treat men and women equally in hiring, pay and promotion, and it is a much smaller number of unfair companies which throws off the averages now.  Fairness in hiring and promotion has come a long way and continues to do so due to laws which have been put in place to prevent women being taken advantage of.  Companies know that when these laws are broken lawsuits are not usually far behind, because women today are very aware of their rights and want to be treated accordingly.  Even in sitcoms and other TV shows, the trend is toward women and men being in equal positions of power.  The pattern in the United States today is moving towards fairness and equality in the workplace.\nI think that most gender discrimination now happens once women enter the workplace, and doesn’t necessarily come in the form of being passed over for promotion or having an inferior salary.  The movement for gender sensitivity has been much more prevalent recently than the movement for gender equality – now I hear more about women being upset about how they are treated as a person by their peers than how much they are paid.  Often something like a snide comment about how a woman’s body looks in a skirt or a certain shirt can make the workplace a very uncomfortable environment for a professional woman.  I think the concern nowadays is to have women feel comfortable working in the offices and companies they have not too long ago earned the right to be a part of.  Fortunately, companies are cracking down on this kind of behavior.  Often a man will have to attend gender sensitivity training to learn how to interact with women professionally, and if his performance repeats the company might feel him enough of a liability to take away his job.\n\n",
        "I think gender discrimination in the U.S. today is blown way out of proportion.  For the most part, employers today can’t afford to discriminate based on sex.  It is economically unwise.  For example, if an employer decides not to hire a woman with a skill set equal to or better than a man, a competitor can snatch her up.  The first employer loses out.  He/she is left with an inferior employee, while his/her competitor gets the better one.  Businesses today are only concerned with results.  There will always be bigots in this world who will discriminate, but that is just the nature of humanity.  U.S. society as a whole, however, does not discriminate based on gender.\nIt is up to the individual to make his or her place in the world.  There have been many instances in which a woman was not hired because the employer felt that she was not as qualified as someone else.  And if that someone else happens to be a man, it may seem like gender discrimination.  I feel like many cases of gender discrimination are just cases of coincidence.  There really is no way to prove that gender discrimination was the deciding factor if a woman isn’t hired.  Unless there is an undeniable trend, its hard to prove anything.\nI think the feminist movement had its place in the 1960’s when it was clear that women were not equal to men in society.  Today, however, women are equal to men.  If a woman wants to get an education and succeed, the only thing that can stop her is herself.  A good portion of the feminist movement today sees men as the enemy.  This is simply not the case.  Sure, there will always be those who discriminate against women.  There is no way to change some people.  Society (in the U.S. at least) is changed.  People are accepting of those who are different from them. \n\n",
        "While I agree with the two privious posts on some points, on others, I find it very difficult to argee with. Yes I believe that I too am of very little significance to the world in that my life is not as glamorous to watch as Brad Pitt’s, and that I find it very disrespectful for poporatzi to follow these famous people around and snap shots of every little thing they do. In Europe, I believe there is a law about this, and that the laws in place to protect people of fame are more heavily followed and carried out. However, when it comes to the aspect of monitoring everything I personally do, I am not to sure I agree with this point.\nThe Patriot Act is said that help protect our nation from possible terrorist attacts in the furture. This is great in my oppinion, but what happens to all of those other people who were listened upon in order to catch the terrorist? I guess one could argue that what they dont know does not hurt them, because those listening in on conversations no longer have to announce to the speakers they are their because the government has agreed to this, but what if you could never have any time to onesefl ever?\nI this act starts to remiend me of that book “1984” by George Orwell, where “Big Brother” was always watching. Pretty soon if we are not careful what ends up happening in the book will happen in real life “for our protection” of coure. We will be having telivision monitors in our every room that also act as cameras to watch what we are doing. We will only be allowed to do certain things, such as write for a certain amount of time before we have to stop, because otherwise we could be cooking up a plane to destroy our country. Like in the book, we might even be required to attened group meetings where we all chant together and say how much we hate our attackers, and while this last point may seem un-intruding, it really is, because it is intruding into our thoughts and words. We are being told what to say and think, which is a form of privacy being taken away (our own thoughts and words).\nAlso, most often the people who are being monitored are those of a certain desent, such as mussulem. This is not right for this group of people to be singled out and monitored for “suspicious” behavior. A normal english looking white guy could be just as corrupt as the true terrorist, yet we are not paying him any mind, because we don’t think he is a threat because his skin is not dark enough. This is all blandergash! One should not have to deal with more of thier privacy being taken away simply on the basis of skin color, or nationality. It is in a way almost lumping all of these people togeter, like we did during WWII to the Japanees, only now we are lumping the together and not telling them even this…yet they are still bound like the Japanese were.\nAll in all, I belive that privacy is extreemly important, and that if one can not act and be a part of a country without trust then we as a nation have a problem. \n\n",
        "Well to start off, gender discrimination is obviously a bad thing. However, it is embedded into our culture and even the world, so getting rid of it will not be an easy task. In fact, it won’t end within our lifetime or any time shortly afterward. Am I just being a doubter? No, this is just the way I feel it will be.\nI feel that a lot of current “discrimination”  is not such a bad thing when considering things such as jobs. For instance: a construction worker vs. a secretary. Men are generally better at construction due to their body types, and women are better at multitasking- that’s general knowledge. Now I do feel as though men and women should be equals in everything, but I can also see how people look at the opposite sex in certain areas and say “what are they doing there?” because of natural make ups and tradition.\nFor instance, I am a male secretary. Weird, right? I openly admit that the job does not incorporate my masculinity WHAT-SO-EVER, but I’ll also say that I shouldn’t be talked down to because of my job. I feel as though it’s alright to joke about though- a humorous form of talking down- I’m cool with that. In fact, I’ll be the first person to joke about my job. I’ll say that I get pinched in the butt, etc. (doesn’t actually happen, mind you…) and nobody really cares- they think it’s just funny.\n-Another point that I would like to bring up is that although many people feel as though women should be treated as equals, many do not feel as though women should be up for the draft. This is a very “wishy washy” topic, but it is something to think about as well. I personally think that everyone should be up for the draft (if implemented) who are physically qualified, but I also think that it is more of a male’s job at the same time. I feel this way just based off of tradition combined with a male’s natural body type- I would never look down upon women because of this though- perhaps I am just used to seeing male soldiers as I grew up with G. I. Joes, etc.\nOver all, I feel as though this country (not the entire world yet) has come a long way, and is doing a great job at defeating gender discrimination, but it will take a long time before any more big changes happen. \n\n",
        "I believe that gay marraige is something that will probably be debated about for a while. Personally, I feel that if a couple of the same sex wishes to “get married” that is ok…except that it should not be called a marraige.  A marraige is between a man and a woman, but dont get me wrong here, I still think same sex couples should be able to be together. The reason why I think it should be called something different though, other than that a marraige is defined as a union between a man and a woman, is because I feel that if it were called the same, people of the church, and other religions (I do realize that we all mainly hear about just the christians, but believe me, there are tons of other religions out there just as opposed to it..we just dont hear about them b/c out president is christian)…would get offended and feel as if thier religion was getting mocked or stepped upon. Now i realize that this would not be the intent at all, but I am just saying how it would be viewed by the christinans and other religions, so that is why i am saying that I believe it is fine for there to be same sex couples unionized, but to come up with a different word (even different then union) to signify thier “marraige”.\nI would also like to say, that I agree that it is not right to make amendments about one’s sexual orientations in either direction. That is a personal choice. I would also like to say, that while i feel it is fine for same sex couples to get “married” for lack of a better word…I am not sure if i feel that they should really be raising children together. The reason for my thought is because children learn by example, so even if they were not gay themselves when born (which is a whole nother argument that i will not address right here) they will still see the behavior and perhaps get steered in that direction. Now I realize that the comment that I just made will get loud opposals, but I have to say, that I have TONS of freinds, and people that I look up to as roll modles, who are in fact gay,…some of these people having children. However, I have also noticed, that these children are all turning out to grow up and be gay themselves too..some of them being adopted, so I do not feel that it is stricktly biological. But again, I also see that they are provided with a very loving family…so I guess you could say that I am still on the fence with this issue.\nOver all, I feel as if same sex unions are ok, as long as they are not pushed so much into one’s face….you dont really see heterosexual couples pushing it into other people’s faces, so i feel as if both types of unions should be treated the same in this regard. \n\n",
        "I feel like we all pretty much agree on this one. I see no reason gay couples should be prevented from getting married, and to this point I have heard no convincing arguments against gay marriage. There are the old standard points: procreation is a part of marriage, gay couples will change the meaning of family… but procreation is not a part of all marriages (and who are we to tell people who are unable to have children together that their marriage is invalid??) and homosexuals share the same family styles as heterosexual couples. I wonder what people are afraid will happen if gay couples are married. What would change? Gay couples already live together and raise families together… they deserve to do so in the same legal standing as heterosexual couples.\nIt may not be the most common argument, but the most emotional argument I’ve heard against gay marriage is religious. In the Catholic Church and many other churches and religions, gay couples can’t be married. People don’t want a governmental approval of gay marriage to interfere with the workings of their church, so they are against it. In reality, all the legalization of gay marriage would do is give homosexual couples the same legal standing as heterosexual couples – their natural right. Nowhere in legislation is there any mention of forcing churches to perform ceremonies marrying homosexuals. Gay marriage would just be the legal recognition that gay couples have an equal status to straight ones.\nThe trouble in agreeing on gay marriage comes when people let their emotions take them over. It’s possible to disagree in principle with something and still politically approve of it. Just because a group of people believe that gay marriage is somehow morally wrong, does that make homosexuals less human and less deserving of the rights which we all share? Legal rights have to be separated from personal opinions to really ensure equality.\n\n",
        "Although it is not nearly as bad as it used to be, I do think that gender discrimination is still prevalent in today’s society. For women, we see it all the time in the media as well as in the work place. Sexual harassment is still an ongoing issue; often times women are not given the respect they deserve from the men the work with, especially if they hold a higher position. In the media, women are still portrayed as sex objects and companies typically only use beautiful and sexy women to sell their products, as if they will appeal to the general public more than and average woman or even a man. A great spin off of gender discrimination against women would be the NBC television show The Office. All of the dominant characters are men, and all of the female roles are dependent on men. One of the women, Jan, who is the boss of the main character and head of the office Michael is thought to be a strong and successful woman, but her main role revolves around the fact that she is sleeping with Michael. The show seems to depict women as not being able to survive without a man, which I think is a complete fallacy and unfair portrayal. Although these examples do show the ugly side that still exists in society, it has come a very long way in improving the lives of women. Women are able to achieve much more success than they ever have been able to in our country’s history, and we are much more advanced in our beliefs of gender equality than many other countries.\nOn the contrary, I do believe that men suffer some inequalities as well. Many companies that are trying to compensate for past discrimination against women favor hiring women over men, which gives them an unfair advantage. Likewise, women have a better chance at getting accepted to colleges than men, especially engineering schools because of the deficit of women in that field. There is also the stigma against men who pursue careers known to be predominantly female, such as nursing or secretarial work. Pursing the fields is looked down upon for men and considered “sissy”.\nSo discrimination goes both ways. \n\n",
        "So obviously, I am against gender discrimination.  You can’t really be for discrimination in our day and age without getting yelled at for it.  But there does still exist, even if subconsciously, gender stereotypes that often don’t allow women to “make it” in todays business community.  However, a certain balance must be found between allowing equal opportunities while not giving women more chances and opportunities than males.  Thats right, in many different situations today, there are cases of reverse discrimination.  This is not the direction we want to take our country. \nA lot of this “more power to females than males” is coming from feminist activists who are so proud to be woman that they forget that we are all people.  One of the worst of the bunch is Mary Daly, who believes in thecomplete seperation of males and females in todays society, and would go even further to say that the planet would be much better without males.  What kind of insanity is driving this woman?  I completely agree with female rights but all you ladies out there, feminists are making your gender look like idiots!  be proud to be a woman, be proud to be a human, but just because youve been scorned to by too many a man in your life, dont take it out on all of us. \nSomething else that needs to be considered in the gender debate is the role of the woman in the family.  Many women want to get as far as they can in the business world but at the same time want to have a family and children.  While I absolutely believe that woman should not face a glass ceiling because of their gender, we have to look at the situation from another point of view: that of the children.  Shouldnt the child have the right to have a nurturing mother and family?  Think how screwed up kids are gonna be in half a century when they are raised by their housekeepers and nursery schools and never have much contact with their parents.  I’m not saying here that women shouldnt be allowed to have high paying jobs if they are going to have kids, but a balance has to be made and priorities have to be established.  In this regard, I don’t believe that pure equality between genders will ever be reached.  I believe there are fundamental differences between men and women and that men and women should play different roles within the families and thus never exactly be equal.  However, we should try as hard as we can to reach the best equality that we possibly can.\nThis is obviously quite a rambling discussion on gender discrimination, but seeing as the issue itself is not easily defined, i guess it is okay. \n\n",
        "On the idea that there is gender discrimination, I believe that this idea of equallity will actually never be fully reached. I know that for most workers, the prefered idea of a boss is a male, thus there is always a glass ceiling affect that keeps women in the work force from getting ahead and being able to obtain jobs of high posistions. In a way, I can understand that most workers would prefer a male as the head of a company that has to deal with construction or IBM type corporations, because usually the idea is that if you are female and do hold such a high position in a company such as this, you are probably very pushy and possibly a bit “butchy”. This is the idea, mind you, not what is actually the case. However, it is also funny to think that if you are the head of a decorating company and you are a male then you must be gay. This again is the universal common thought, not what is actually the case. I just find it commical how some genders are expected to act if given certain responcibilites, when in fact they individuals and should not be stereotyped.\nAnother area that I find very interesting about gender discrimination is the idea that women think that just because they can bear children they should feel the need to voice out their oppinions on whether or not they can have abortions or not. If one thinks about it they claim that it is discrimination against them when they are told what they can and can not do with their bodies. THis is not the whole story though. Most people who argue against it are not argueing agians the women themselves, but against the idea that the women are in fact making a desision to kill someone. It actually goes back to the fact of some people believeing in from the moment of conception, there is a living person inside of the female, and thus they should not be th soul determiners of weather or not the baby gets to live or dye. The females who often argue on the idea of abortion ofthen do not think of it as killing anyone, so really this whole argument of gender discrimination is a front for what the true matter is.\nI do find it sad how now a days our society is getting to accept the idea that women can have children out of wedlock and still be ok on their own. While, I do respect women who are able to rais a child and hold down a job at the same time, i feel as if it is sad that the child only has one parent as a role model instead of two. I realize that there are many  valid reasons for not marying into a marraige, even if there is a child present, yet, if this is the case, why did they decide to have a child together? In my oppinion, it is best to wait until you know that you have found your right partner, and then have children, instead of out of wedlock.\nThere is another idea that men should be the soul providors for a family, yet as evident today, this is so often not the case anymore. More and more families are having both parents work. This is nice, because it shows that women can do things outside of the home other than just raise a family and take care of the house. I do find it sad, though, how sometimes, when the role is reversed…men stay at home and the women is the soul providor, that it is looked down upon. I do not feel as if this should be the case, yet it is just such the opposite of what everyone has grown up thinking that many people can not grasp this new concept. I hope that for the future this is one area that everyone can accept more in society.\nI guess when one really lookes at the idea of gender discrimination, it really often has to deal with other outside issues that influence the ideas on top of what “gender” issue is being talked about. So the whole idea really goes deeper then one thinks of pure cut and dry gender. \n\n",
        "http://www.genome.gov/10002328 (i believe this is a clearer representation about what the starter was trying to say on genetic discrimination.)\nthere are pros and cons to any new technology (ask a history buff to explain the industrial revolution if you don’t believe me). that being said, one of pros *and* cons of new security technology is that it’s easier to get a hold of private information online. i would consider this a pro because patrolling online sites (such as Myspace) leads to the arrests of pedophiles and other disgusting people. however, since the patrol of these sites is much more common now (for a good reason), you simply have to be a little more careful with the information you decide to put online. personally, i have no problem giving up a little privacy/freedom for the common good…\ngenetic discrimination is another story. i actually wasn’t aware of this issue until i read the starter’s post, so i decided to do a bit more research on the subject. basically, nowadays you can get genetic testing done to see if you are genetically prone to a certain disease/diseases, and knowing that ahead of time can help you plan for the worst. however, this information is held in your permanent medical record, and some people with predispositions to certain awful diseases (such as cancer) are being discriminated by employers and insurance companies. now, insurance companies are already known to be evil (proof -> http://www.blackchapman.com/html/v16-1a.htm), but employers not giving people jobs because you might get cancer or another disease? thats just…not right. from what i’ve looked at, it seems like getting this kind of genetic testing done is a very good idea, especially if you’re trying to prevent getting a disease you think you might be predisposed to. this kind of discrimination would obviously turn people away from the idea. on the other side of the fence, what medical information should be allowed out in the open? once again, refering to the starter post, i would definately want someone who has unprotected sex without telling their partner they have HIV to go to jail for being ‘reckless’ at the least. it’s just another example of the gray area surrounding privacy and new technology. i foresee that as long as new technology exists, new versions of these conversations will continue to pop up. \n\n",
        "The issue of privacy is definatly a critical one. It is a hot topic especially when it comes down to a concern for security. While it is essential that we keep a close watch for any possibilities of misdeed, we also have to remember where to draw the line. It is important that we do not allow any possible threats to be carried out and it is nearly just as important that we do not invade on people’s rights guaranteed by the constitution. One big issue that has recently come up is that of public internet servers such as myspace.\nThe keyword there is “public” as opposed to “private.” Since all of somebodys actions while logged into myspace are not being done in their own personal domain, it is impossible to say that myspace is a legitimate place to maintain your privacy. While there are several features on myspace that allow you to keep things personal, you can’t forget that you do not own the server in which this information is being stored on. While it shouldn’t be allowed for any organization to step in and retrieve this information without permission from the people who own it, it also cannot be forgotten that it can be retrieved with some sort of probable cause.\nIf you choose to keep this information private, lets say via a “private message” you obviously don’t want anybody but the recipiant to be able to view this information. I feel that this information should not be distributed anywhere unless the recipiant feels that it is a threat and they call someone else into it and has the information retrieved (with the approval of myspace). However, any public posts should be freegame for any kind of prosecution depending on the information put in it. Posting anything threatening in a public post would be like shouting “bomb” on an airplane.\nThere also has to be a place for schools to draw the line when it comes down to invasion of privacy as well. One big debate that has arisen has been that of facebook. While it is nice to know that schools can use facebook to ensure our security, they also have been known to use it to get kids in trouble for much more minor offenses (such as drinking on campus). I can’t officially say that they are not allowed to do this, since if someone does post a picture of themselves with a beer in their hand and they are under 21, it is illegal activity. However, if this information is attained without any kind of suspicion and it is being attained on facebook’s servers as opposed to their own, theyt should for the sake of human rights pass off this information as invalid. Then again, students have the option to keep their facebook profile private to only them and their friends.\nIt’s a difficult issue to deal with because while on one hand you have the governments protection off campus, on campus it is a whole different story. Loyola is a private institution, giving them many rights that the government does not have. When you attend this school you basically wave your constitutional rights at the door. I personally feel that this is wrong. However, the only way to be able to deal with this is to take some of the power away from private institutions and pass it back to the government so we will be able to maintain some of our rights guaranteed by the constitution. \n\n",
        "While it may be important to avoid trivialization of Church traditions by keeping them consistent, the advantages of their modification may be worth the risk.  As the world continues to change on a daily basis, the Catholic Church is getting left behind.  In general, people are not able to embrace traditions so ancient that the reasons for their existence are becoming obscured.  As was said, celibacy and a male priesthood are not vital to the message the Catholic Church means to portray.  If, after changing these traditions, a new wave of dedicated priests/priestesses emerges and a revitalization of faith occurs amongst Catholic followers, what harm is done?  If nothing is done, and the priesthood continues to decline at the rate it is going, no priests will be left to live by the traditions the Church has kept secure. \n\nUltimately, I leave these questions up to the Church.  Regardless of personal opinion, the Vatican, with its legions of dedicated theologians, holds the most comprehensive and in-depth knowledge and understanding of the Bible, our only connection to something that at least resembles God’s word.  While we can never, as mortals, perfectly interpret the word of God, the Vatican is certainly in the best position to take that role.  It is as if I attempted to argue with a botanist about whether a plant is poison ivy or not.  Who would you trust?  Obviously, some matters have more subjective content than others, but what viable solution can be presented that will decide on the “most Catholic” answer to these questions while maintaining the Church’s stability?  The Church is in a very difficult position.  Similarly to politicians, the Church has a world of people to please, people with infinitely different points of view.  Should the Church change its long established traditions to please a portion of its followers?  I don’t know, but I’m leaving it up to the Church itself to reach the answer.\n\n\u001a",
        "            The Iraq “war”.  It’s a touchy subject for most people, especially kids our age.  Most of the soldiers in Iraq are not much older than us, but hey, they’re fighting for what they believe in, there hasn’t been a draft. We went in for the wrong reasons, yeah, we should have just gone in saying we were going after Sadaam, hell, we’ve had the ability and the permission to do that for years. What I don’t get is people saying we should just pull all of our soldiers out of Iraq.  Drives me crazy.  There’s a reason that we went there, and we need to help the people there, there’s no one else to help.  This isn’t some political ploy to keep Bush in office or to make him look better.  Honestly, when people say stuff like that it scares me.  First of all, no one would use others lives just to get themselves ahead, it’s a ridiculous notion.  Secondly, how in the HELL would this help?\n            Yeah, sure, after 9/11 people were screaming for us to go to war.  So we went.  Those same people are screaming for us to pull out and leave these people defenseless and without a government. This isn’t the war on terror anymore; we’re aiming to help people.  We’ve gotten rid of the terror.  Then people say, “Oh at least under Sadaam there was order”.  Yeah, an order maintained by murder, how is that good in any way shape or form?  Contrary to the belief being spewed from our media these days, we aren’t trying to make a “little America”, we’re trying to make a better place for everyone to live.  We wouldn’t try to make a “little America” It’s not going to work anywhere but here.  The culture is too different.  Why shouldn’t we try to help those who need it?  No one else will.\n",
        "The question of how to balance the emphasis between safety and security in our country in light of recent events is certainly an interesting question. Personally, I believe a national ID system would be very effective and helpful as a safety measure. Right now states don’t communicate well with each other about some things, as evidenced by the amount of criminals who manage to jump parole and start over in a different state. In some cases, they even end up being caught again in the new state for the same type of crime they were originally convicted of, which could be prevented if we had an effective national identification system.\nWhile I think national IDs are a good idea, I believe the amount of information made public about a person should be tightly controlled. If they were going to make criminal records accessible by looking up someone’s ID that is one thing; however, to have personal information like medical records stored for access in the same way I believe that would be an invasion of privacy. While it would aid in stopping the spread of diseases like HIV and AIDS, the end of medical privacy would do far more harm than good. It would be hard to believe that given access to that information, a hiring company would not refuse someone with a disease like HIV because they would worry about it making their other workers nervous. A system of national IDs would certainly be more effective than the Census for collecting current information about trends in the population.\nIf we go to a European style system of national IDs, we will have to tighten our regulations on who can access the information the government collects about us in the same way. No one outside the government should be able to access that kind of information without the express consent of the person it concerns. Right now, you can sign up on an email list for one company to send you updates or freebies and within a week your inbox will be flooded with junk mail from places you’ve never heard of. Such information selling is inappropriate and an inconvenience. I hate to think what would happen if companies were allowed to see information about the kinds of stores you visit or cards you apply for by accessing your national ID. In short, national IDs would make identification and security a much easier job for the government, but the access to the information they store would have to be carefully regulated. \n\n",
        "People in this country can’t even get over the fact that humans come in different colors and shapes. There is discrimination EVERYWHERE in this “land of the free and the home of the brave”, along the lines of race, gender, sexual orientation, body type, and a myriad of other factors. If you need proof, look at the racial, genetic, and area wage gaps in our supposed “land of golden opportunity”. The LAST thing we need is to add another discriminatory quality to our list of prejudices.\nHumans don’t get to choose the specifics of the body/situation they are born into. We have even less control over what our genetic makeup will be! If we are to start discriminating along the lines of DNA, we will be LOSING all the potential that those with “bad genes” have to offer. Society would be hindered if we denied opportunities to those people; they undoubtedly have just as many essential ideas/capabilities as genetically “normal” people do. Besides, whether or not someone is genetically predisposed to a certain kind of cancer has NO BEARING on their ability/inability to actively contribute!\nWe have gotten along just fine WITHOUT genetic discrimination, and I’d bet that a fair number of society’s most active benefactors wouldn’t have been allowed to be such if “genetic” tests were a reality. We have SERIOUS class issues in America. There is already enough inequity and injustice in this country. Wide spread DNA testing would only accentuate these class issues, giving those who “pass” even more undeserved entitlement than our rich and powerful already have, and giving those who “fail” even less to start with than our currently marginalized. This would just give our nuveau-riche one more reason to bask naively in their own greatness.\nIs someones’s “health risk” potentiality a sufficient condition for denying them opportunities to thrive? Are our corporate health insurance premiums really so important to us that we are willing to preclude ALL persons with certain genetic characteristics from participating in society? If so, that disgusts me. If DNA testing is made a reality, it will just illustrate our society’s declining community values, and reinforce our “American” tendency to label ourselves “exceptional”. This is one of the most self-serving, trashy, and disgusting ideas I have ever heard. If it goes through, I will lose a LOT of faith in our government’s ability to effectively serve its citizens, and gain a sense that our politico-economic power structure is really just serving itself. \n\n",
        "The institution of marriage is terribly broken, as can be seen by the fact that we have a 42%+ divorce rate, and eradicating gay marriage is NOT going to fix it. The “religious right” and the “liberal left” have to stop defining them along arbitrary single-issue lines like this one, because they are going nowhere. Besides, the majority of gay people who want marriage feel so because they want the LEGAL benefits (hospital visits, tax advantages of marriage, co-sign their mortgage, etc). They do not just want to marry for petty security, like so many straight couples who end up divorced. What we need to do is find a COMPROMISE, one that allows gay couples who love each other to enjoy the legal benefits of a married status WITHOUT offending the fundamentalist christians who poop themselves at the mention of “same sex marriage”. We can call it “gayrriage” or “civil union” or something, I honestly dont care what the name is, but it should allow the financial, legal, tax, and other priveleges of marriage to gay couples without being named “marriage” in a religiously offensive way. No offense to those who are devoutly religious, as faith is an extremely respectable thing. However, it is innapropriate to hijack the legal system to serve the “moral ends” of one particular religion. It is also unfair to disallow the aforementioned benefits (which are of a legal nature) to gay couples on religious grounds (which are not of a legal nature). Anyone catch my drift? Gay marriage won’t end the world or corrupt our society, and it doesn’t even have to be called gay marriage…. I don’t care if it’s called a “happy pony land ceremony” instead of a “wedding”, as long as the gay couple is allowed to legally act with the unity provided to married couples, our society will be treating its gay citizens more fairly. \n\n",
        "I am a member of the Roman Catholic Church, and have been raised all my life following it by two devout Catholics as Parents. I know the Church’s traditions, and go to Church basically every Sunday…I’m not as conservative as the Church, in fact, I am basically a moderate with general conservative views. I really hate the idea of the Church changing, because I am someone who hates change in general. Yeah, I guess you can say that I have that attitude talked of in the discussion starter- “if it ain’t broke, then don’t fix it.” The way I figure it is that if it’s a religion, then you shouldn’t change it based upon what people want (as opposed to need). Am I saying that the Church doesn’t need more people preaching? no. All I’m saying is that the Church made room for men by making them priests and made room for women by making them nuns. Nuns take a vow of joyful service, so they should enjoy what they do and be satisfied with it. I don’t think that anyone should be telling the Church to allow for women to be priests because I feel that the Nuns should be the only people doing that.\nWith Priests being able to marry, the Church views them as having a sort of “marriage” with God, with the regular people being their children of God (hence the reason for us calling priests “Father…”) Would I feel that it would help the Church if Priests could marry? Yes and No. I feel as though it would increase the numbers (as with letting women become priests), of devout members within the church (children of priests [men or women possibly] are sure to be devout members).\nI love the idea of the Church expanding, etc., but I also love tradition- which is one of the main values that the Catholic Church is run by. I hate the idea of following peoples wants to modernize it to suit their wants…\nWhen talking about how the Church isn’t attracting the youth at all, that’s crap. I went to World Youth Day in Germany a few years ago which had wow….either 1.3 or 3.1 million people at the ending mass (i realize that those are two numbers which are nowhere close to each other, but they’re both huge)…John Paul II, obviously one of the best things to ever happen to the church, reached out to the youth, and through him many youth have gotten involved in the Church. I know of 18 year olds who are going to become priests which also gives me hope\nI don’t know if the whole shortage of priests bit is exaggerated or what, but I don’t see a need for the Church to change at this moment…\n",
        "I believe that it is crucial for the church to change. People must remember that the church was established over a thousand years and stories of Jesus were written over 60 years after his death. the times have changed. I am not saying that the church should change what they believe in because then catholicism would not be a religion, I am simply saying that the church must become more open - minded and realize that times have changed. Being a catholic myself, I feel like I represent how the majority of other catholics view the church. I think that it is somewhat narrow - minded and I don’t like that all decisions are left to be decided by one man. I do not believe in the hierarchy that the church has established. Due to the fact that the church was established over a thousand years ago the church needs to be revamped and become the church of the present day. Unlike Jesus’ time, women now have rights, we do not stone people anymore, and equal rights is a huge part of our society. I feel that women would make wonderful priests and that the church is only hurting itself by not allowing them to become such. Already the church is lacking priests, allowing women to become priests would only benefit them. However, at the same time, I see how this could be somewhat contradictory to what the Bible says. Although is it not to be taken literally, it is clearly stated that women should not be ordained priests and that the idea of having only male priests was based solely upon the 12 Apostles. Again, this took place in a male - dominated society so it is a tough call. I believe that me, being a young, catholic woman who believes in the more liberal aspect of the church, has the same views of others my age. I am for women’s rights and I believe that the church must be updated. We are long overdue. \n\n",
        "            The question of whether gay marriage should be legal cannot be addressed without a clear understanding of what it means to be married.  The term marriage has many different connotations, usually associated with a man and woman, but really, a marriage can exist between people of any gender.  In my opinion, a marriage is intended as a way of formally, publicly, and legally stating one’s allegiance to another person.  Marriage is a way of expressing love and union.   Marriage is a pledge to stand by another person’s side through thick and thin, good times and bad. With this view of marriage in mind, it is impossible to deny homosexual couples the opportunity to marry.  If two people of the same sex love one another in the same way that a man and woman love one another, why should they not be given the same rights and privileges?\n            One argument against gay marriage is that marriage is intended for procreation.  It may be true that many offspring are born as a result of marriage, but it is also true that our society allows for marriages that will not result in new births.  Such examples are infertile or elderly couples, who will not be having children, but are still allowed to get married.  Also, many unwed women are having children in today’s day and age, which means that marriage is not a necessity for procreation.  For these reasons, it is unfair to deny homosexual partners the chance to get married based on the fact that their union will not produce offspring.\n            There is really no good reason to not allow gay couples to get married.  In an era where tolerance and acceptance are praised, it seems counterproductive to be so limiting in our views of homosexuals.  The only way to truly promote tolerance and justice is to be accepting of all other kinds of peoples, and to not oppress them by denying them rights.  To have gay marriage be illegal is a form of oppression, because it is inherently unfair and biased.  Therefore, it is very important to stay open-minded and permit legal marriages of gay couples. \n\n",
        "I believe that gender discrimination is absolutely still an issue in the United States today. A few years back, I was writing a paper, and as research, I wad required to find the mean salaries for white men and white women. The difference was jarring: even though our higher academic institutions are now more female than male, white men still made an average of $10,000 more a year than white females ($40,000 to $30,000) the difference between black men and black women is also $10,000 dollars, $30,000 to $20,000). Thus, even though more women are getting degrees than men, it means that either men are making more for the same jobs, or that men are holding more higher paying jobs than women- and a quick glance into a corporate board room across the country will tell you that the latter is most definitely true.\n            Another area where it is easy to see gender discrimination against females is in the ongoing debate about whether or not Hilary Clinton has what it takes to be the next president. Almost every article is prefaced with the question “is America ready for a woman president?” There mere fact that this question has to be asked is a pretty glaring example of very blatant gender discrimination. The insinuation, of course, is that a woman brings something different, something perhaps inferior, to the table than a man does.\n            Of course, discrimination can certainly swing both ways. There are certain professions that men still get strange looks for taking. You don’t see many male hairdressers, or many male nurses (the movie “Meet The Parents”) comes to mind when Robert DeNiro makes fun of Ben Stiller’s character for being a male nurse). If anyone admits to being a hairdresser or a male nurse, he’ll often be asked, well, why? And there’s always an underlying insinuation that maybe, he’s gay- which, of course, in our culture is emasculating.\n             Gender discrimination is alive and well in America. It’s seen in the discrepancy in salaries between men and women, it’s seen in the popularity of men’s sports over women’s sports, and it’s seen in the fact that this country has not had, in 200 years, a single serious female candidate for president- even though many European countries have long since had female presidents or prime ministers. There are cases, too, of male discrimination, but the issue is much less serious, and often comes from jobs that are viewed as too “feminine.” \n\n",
        "After reading the discussion starter and pondering this topic over the course of this research project, it occurs to me that there is no legitimate reason why gay marriage should be outlawed.\nThe only valid argument that could be used against gay marriage is the danger of ending procreation altogether, which would only happen if everyone in the world were homosexual and never procreated.  However, this argument is meaningless unless being homosexual turned out to be dependent on personal choice alone.  In recent times, as research into the “gay gene” looms ever closer, the chance that homosexuality is dependent upon one’s genes and not one’s personal choice is getting greater and greater.  Even without the “gay gene,” one can not say a person would choose to be gay for any good reason.  First, it is against physical nature (the parts only fit together one way).  Second, to declare oneself as gay in this world is accepting a life of possible mockery and hatred.  Fortunately, this is not as much of a worry in our world today as it was a half century ago.\nAs it is shown that being homosexual is not one’s choice,  one’s sexuality becomes an impersonal trait, just like gender or skin color.  For anyone to discriminate against someone based on this kind of trait is a crime and should never be practiced.  Thus, there should be no difference between opposite sex marriage and same sex marriage.\nInstead of legalizing same sex marriage, one solution that has been suggested is to allow homosexuals to get married and call it something else.  This solution is a insult, a slap in the face, against homosexuals and should not be practiced.  To refer to a homosexual marriage as another term is to acknowledge the discrimination that exists and is causing the problem in the first place.  It is getting around the problem and not solving it - shutting up a discriminated population to create an “easy fix” in our society today. \n\n",
        "Obviously this one of the biggest stories, if not the biggest story in the media today. Almost everyday we hear about new deaths in Iraq and we hear stories about how they are trying to set up a stable government. One question on most people’s minds is, “how much longer?” This “war on terror” is only generating more anti-American sentiments throughout the Middle East. “What have we solved?”\nIn my own opinion I feel that the war has gone on long enough. I did not agree with the original reasons for them to go into Iraq and I wholy resent the way that the war has gone. There were no weapons of mass destruction there. Wasn’t the original quarrel with Al Queda in Afghanistan? If anything, we only created more problems than we solved. While it is nice to have a terrible dictator out of power, there is still the fact that we have left their country in a chaotic state which I think very few would actually want to live in. Any thought that we could possibly set up a stable government with Iraq in this state is insane.\nThough I do feel that the war has gone on for too long, I do not think that we should pull out. We have caused a great deal of destruction and are obligated to fix what we’ve broken and get the people there back on their feet. Pulling out now would just send the two opposing sides (Suni and Shitte) into civil war. It could even turn out to be another Rwanda. In order to make any progress at all we first need to seek some sort of agreement between both the groups. Once we find that it will be much more plausable that we can set up a free government for the people there. However, when doing this we will also have to take into consideration the will of the people and the subjects that they are sensitive too (such as religion). \n\n",
        "I wanna start off by saying that I don’t care about gay people at all…in a good way.  I do not care what they do and I do not care if they get married.  I personally don’t agree with gay relationships, but if two men or two women want to get married my personal feelings have nothing to do with it.  Neither should the feelings of the conservations who find fault with them.  They argue that the sanctity of the church has been violated.  To this I say: if you don’t think the sanctity of your church has already been violated by hundreds of years of corrupt popes and priests, then you are a naive Christian.  So you don’t think gays should be allowed to marry but your priests touch little boys? Sweet.\nIn the discussion starter, morality of the family is mentioned,and while I certainly agree that family is important, this has nothing to do with gays being allowed to marry.  You can’t ban a certain type of relationship in the country because it doesnt promote good moral behavior.  There is nothing immoral, legally wise about same sex relationships.  Sure, you can find stuff in the Bible about why its bad, but the Bible holds no place in government.  Clearly one thing that is great about America, that most everyone will agree with on some level, is that our country was founded on the concept of freedom.  However, the conservatives (who seem to be the ones talking about freedom the most) have forgotten what it is.  So why are we denying homosexals the liberties enjoyed by the rest of us? Hell, even death row inmates are allowed to get married, and they’re about to die for severe crimes.  I guess thats just saying something about what freedom really is in this country.\nOne last point is that I dont agree with gay relationships.  I dont understand them and I dont like that they are doing something anatomically incorrect.  I feel they are misguided, that maybe if they gave the other sex a whirl they might just like it.  HOWEVER, I do not want to obstruct their liberties. Its not my place.  Hell, I think most conservatives are wrong, but I still think they should be allowed to vote.  I have several gay friends, one of which has been my good friend since almost I was born.  We’re still great friends and while it freaks me out that he likes to touch other dudes, I don’t have a problem with it.  He can keep doing what he does even though I think its wierd.  I mean, my roommate reads anime and I think thats weird and a waste of time, but that bitch can read anime all he wants, I dont give a care.  That’s whats great (or rather, what should be great) about this country. \n\n",
        "The Catholic Church should certainly consider changing its ways.  I agree that the decision is completely up to the Catholic Church (the community) as to what changes should be made and when they should be made.  Times have changed and information has changed – people have progressed intellectually.  With this new information, it is up to the Church to decide what in their tradition is antiquated and what should stay tradition.\nAs with any organization, there is a certain element that should stay traditional.  Tradition is part of the identity and in the case of the Catholic Church, it encompasses their dogmas, doctrines, and any other central beliefs to the faith.  Some of their practices, however, reveal the antiquity with the organization.\nWhile I have no references, I have heard that the practice of not eating meat on Fridays during the Lenten season was derived from early Christian history fishing industry issues.  Certainly this issue and many others should be reconsidered in the contemporary Church so as not to push out potential members because of ridiculous, meaningless practices.\nThere are also issues such as gender discrimination amongst priests that needs to be revisited.  It seems very hard to believe that the God Christians speak of could make man and woman equal and yet not give her access to the clergy.  It seems to me that so much of the tradition has been passed along and given cultural and purely human interpretation:  it is said that the Holy Spirit has passed along the proper message to keep the faith alive in the Church, but I doubt that a lot of this inspiration did not come from purely human motivations.\nOne of the main problems with change in the Catholic Church, I think, is the lack of respect they would be given by many followers if any radical changes were made.  As with any organization founded on strong ideals and beliefs, if any of them are altered or appear to be altered then some of the followers may turn away.  Perhaps the Church believes that certain changes, whether significant to the faith or not, will appear just that way to many followers causing them to question their credibility.\n\n",
        "After September 11, 2001, the United States was in turmoil. People wanted to take action, they wanted to see these terrorists be captured and locked up, they were sad, hurt, confused, and scared. President Bush, I believe, had no other choice but to declare war on these nations. If we didn’t, we would risk the fact that these terrorist organizations might think that they have weakened and beaten us, which they have not. It could have lead to even more deadly attacks. In the beginning, this war seemed like a good thing. Then, slowly but surely, we began to lose focus on what we went in their to do and now we are stuck. If we leave, we risk more terrorist attacks and a possible downfall of what we tried to build their, a governing body. If we stay, we only lose more money and more American lives. I was one of those Americans whom at first, was all for the war. I wanted to see the terrorists be captured and I wanted them to feel the pain that they caused our nation to feel on that day. I lost five people on September 11, 2001. My family was scared, saddened, and angry. As time went on, I just kept seeing that we were just losing more and more lives. We were making more and more family’s feel the way my family did on that day. I is unnecessary for us to stay their and, moreover, keep sending more men over. I believe that the people over there are always going to be stuck in their own ways, they have been for years. And, if they can’t stop fighting with themselves, then we certainly cannot help them. The people over there also think that we are interfering with their culture and all that. I am sick of hearing that. If they do not want our help, then I don’t see why we should sacrifice anymore men and women. \n\n",
        "i don’t think that gender discrimination exists in the sense that the term previously stood for.  what i mean by that is that i dont think that the majority of the population (or at least in the united states) views women as a lower demographic or lower caste. gender issues will always exist… i mean, unless humans become asexual, there will always be the basic (as well as the subtle) differences between a man and a woman, and those differences will need to be worked out differently as society changes. just like we’ve adapted to the times with previous issues - albeit sometimes the process was very slow - we will forever need to continually adapt our views to update with the realities of the current society.\ni think there is not a very strong argument for why working women would detriment the family values of America.  similarly, i don’t think there is any argument at all for why men should be removed from household completely.\nto begin, the argument that “few women seem attracted to men who engage in [childrearing and domestic tasks] to the detriment of their careers” is a clever and highly misleading one.  of course women don’t want a man who does these thing to the detriment of their careers.  any person - man or woman - wouldn’t want their spouse to be overly involved in anything that hurt their career.  This is not to say that the family should not be a prioirity before work - as a matter of fact, i think it should always be a priority before work - but the wording of the argument is very loaded and assumes that men that spend time with their families do it to a fault, or are overemotional.\nas for women being “too work-oriented”, thats just plain discrimination.  a balance can be reached where both the man and woman can work and be at home - my parents did it, and you don’t have to look far for extra examples. \n\n\u001a",
        "The church is an interesting topic for me to discuss.  I was raised both catholic and protestant and now I’m leaning heavily towards neither.  But I have to be honest, before I say anything about the issues in and surrounding the Catholic Church there’s something else I need to say.  There is a problem with any organized religion on the planet because, lets face it, no one is going to agree on every little point.  It’s just not going to happen.  But the Catholic Church has its own problems.  In regards to some things it seems like the Church is still stuck in the Dark Ages.  Women can’t be part of the clergy, well why the hell not?  Women can do anything men can do, and some things that they can’t.  It’s ridiculous to not give them the option to pledge their lives to the clergy, and not just as a nun.  I don’t care that the church is supposed to be infallible; it’s a chauvinistic tradition.  This isn’t even a rule set down by the bible; it’s a tradition that was made by the church in a time where women couldn’t own property.  It really makes no sense for this “rule” to be in place.\nAnother “rule” that has no place in our society today is the rule that priests can’t marry.  This is another one that has no actual religious backdrop.  Priests originally were allowed to have families and marry, however the Church realized that if priests had sons, their land and money went to their sons rather than the church.  This is a prime example of how the church is run by man, who is not infallible.  I can’t help but see this as a problem.  These aren’t things that are mandated by God or even the Word of God, but by man.  Who are we to tell someone who wants to have love, or a woman who wants to devote her life to the church by teaching the populace the word of God that they cannot do it? \n\n",
        "Gay marriage is a topic that has become very important in our society today. Now more then ever we see same sex couples in our communities. So what is it about these people that make them different? Personally, I think that Gay Marriage should be legal in every state in the United States.\nScientists are learning that being homosexual might actually be a genetic difference. If this discovery turns out to be true, there will be no reason not to allow gay people to marry. Not allowing them certain rights would be like not allowing marriage to people with blonde hair. A genetic difference is no reason to oppress a person.\nReligion is another speed bump on the road to acceptance of homosexuals. In the Catholic faith they have accepted gay people as people, but they do not condone the lifestyle that they have chosen. Although we may never see the acceptance of homosexuals in the church, there are a lot of changes that can be made in government to help.\nArguments against same sex marriages argue that there is no real reason to be married. But why are same sex couples being denied the same rights of heterosexual couples? The only rule for marriage against heterosexual couples is that they must be eighteen years of age or older in order to be wed. Why are there any more restrictions on same sex couples? They should be granted the same rights as everyone else.\nNow, same-sex couples who are not allowed to be married are still living together and adopting children. Marriage would allow for these men and women to raise a family in a more conventional way. Although they would not be able to have children of their own, adoption would allow them to still have children and be parents. Marriage should be available to everyone. \n\n",
        "When thinking about the government looking at my records, i think of people who I know who work for the government. When I look at it in this aspect, it reminds me that the government is made up of regular people who everyone lives amongst. Isn’t the guy next door who works for the government looking at my private records kind of the same thing as the person on the other side of my house who isn’t a government employee? Sure, the government employee has more of a right I’d say, but it still creeps me out…\nFor the companies that look for medical records, etc.- I think that that’s a poor way of going about business, but they DO need to look out for themselves. I really can’t have an opinion on this section of the topic, because a lot of people do lie about their health, etc. to get something they want. Companies can’t keep losing money over people who screw them over…On the other hand, I know of a lot of people who do not follow the same paths as their family within health issues- so these people do get the bad end of the deal.\nI do feel that if it involves the risk of someone else, companies included, then records should be privately distributed- with sincere confidentiality. I believe that the people finding out the information should only find out the bare minimum of what they have to know and then can’t distribute that little bit of information. Cases in this would include a partner of someone with HIV/AIDS, or a company looking into giving somebody a sort of health plan.\nWe can’t have people in our society be ambitious enough  to lie about their medical history, etc. in order to better themselves while at the same time causing other people their jobs.\nThe government really is here for our safety, or at least I am brainwashed to think this way….:-/…. This is just a glitch in our history as other things in the past which have caused discriminatory actions. I’m not sure when, but the future will most likely bring laws that will please just about everyone on this topic- after this, I feel that this topic will no longer be as big of an issue. \n\n",
        "            I am firm believer that the United States should have never embarked on any type of military intervention in Iraq.  I have always looked at war as a last resort.  If a genocide needs to be stopped, or a dictator needs to have his hand taken away from the nuclear button, then in certain situations war is the only logical outcome.  That being said I agreed with our involvement in WWII and I would have been in agreement with any military assistance we could have provided during the Rwandan genocide that the Caucasian world never lost sleep over.  But Iraq, Iraq to me was a country ruled by an iron fist dictator that we installed when it was politically correct to do so in the early 1980’s.  Before we knew it our little Seddam had emerged from his puppet role as foe to the Ayatollah  Khomeini of Iran was now himself the most feared dictator in the Middle East.  Our foreign policy mistake almost thirty years ago has not lead to not one but now two wars in Iraq, and perhaps even worse our occupation can now be seen as holding up the infrastructure of a nation divided.\n            It is tough for me as an American voter with liberal political ideologies to not feel lied to by our government.  We have perpetuated the colonialist ways of nation building though big corporations. Dick Chaney’s own company Halliburton is rebuilding the rubble that used to be called Iraq, furthermore, pip lines through Afghanistan and other Middle Eastern countries are still flowing as planned.  To me Iraq was a smoke screen that ended up accidentally blinding the ones using it for cover.  There were no weapons of mass destruction only a brutal dictator that we as a country have shared intimate ties with for decades.  We should be out of Iraq as soon as possible.  The casualties, the expenses, and the Iraqi people, all need to be taken into account at this point.  Iraq is more dangerous today than it has ever been, and now our great nation may be directly responsible for that.      \n\n",
        "the issue of gay marriage is definately one of the most controversial subjects of society today, and equally hard to have a solid stance on the matter.  the arguement does make sense that marriage represents a man and woman union because its “natural” and that they can biologically have children and start a family, but just because gay couples can’t naturally have kids does that make them have bad morals?  i don’t think so — just because they have a relationship with someone of the same sex doesn’t make them “evil”.\ni think if society accepted gay people into the community, the concept of gay couples as parents wouldn’t seem so extreme.  the concept of gay parents as “farming gay kids” - not my phrase - is also ridiculous; heterosexual parents raise kids that turn out to be gay all the time, so why shouldn’t the opposite be the same?\nhowever, if gay people are given the right to marry, i wonder what other groups of people previosly unable to get married in the way they want would push more strongly for their rights.  i don’t think this is necessarily a big issue, but it would be interesting to see if polygamous people or other groups would start to say, “hey, if they can get married, why can’t we?” either way, once the system ‘lets down their guard’, i think other groups will take advantage of the situation.\nalso, civil unions are really just marriage light.  marriage shouldn’t be defined by the state in regards to any religion’s definition, so really the only difference is the tax benefits as mentioned in the discussion starter post. if the government is going to give gay couples the right to civil unions, they might as well go the full nine and give them the right to marriage. Catholics can still define marriage as strictly between a man and woman - they shouldn’t care what the govenment defines it as. \n\n",
        "The question at hand is “should the catholic church change it’s ways?” In my opinion, I leave that decision up to the catholic church. While I do agree that some of the practices and beliefs are outdated and conflict with many views of the rising society, it is not really up to me nor anybody outside of the catholic church to make that decision. However, I do believe that it would be a good thing if they were to change their ways and become more accepting of lets say, priests marrying.\nI born and raised into the catholic church and as I became more politically and socially aware I decided to leave the church and go my own way. Personally I felt some of the ideas encouraged in the church to be much too restricting. For one I did not agree on the churches stance on homosexuality. I also was not too fond of the idea of the “confession booth.” If god is supposed to forgive all, then how come I need to talk to a priest about it?\nAnother thing I did not approve of was the hierarchy within the church. We are all supposed to be perceived as equal in god’s eyes, so why is one man holier than me? It is almost hypocritical for them to say that all people are equal yet this man holds a title of nobility. Perhaps I just am more able to notice these things because of the society I live in and the peer group that I grew up with. Who knows, but to me some of these practices seem out of times, yet the church is persistant in their technique, and this has begun to strike up conflict with the progressing society around them. (such as gay marriage)\nNow one change I would suggest is allowing priests to marry. This I feel would severly reduce the amount of paedophilia incidents within the church. Priests are human beings as well and they are prone to human nature as well. It would be a lot safer and a lot more moral for them to have a reasonable outlet for their “sexual tensions” rather than have to resort to horrifying means. Though it is true that not many priests are like this, but it would still make a heavy impact if marriage was left as an option.\nThere is not much else that I would suggest though because for every argument I would present it would go against something within the catholic teachings, which may in fact be asking too much. It would be like asking them to change a whole concept that helps to build their foundation. Any change they want to make is in their hands. It would be nice to see them change and adapt at least a little bit further towards the current mindset, but I don’t feel that anybody should force them to. \n\n",
        "The main issue, on the surface, with the war in Iraq seems to be a lack of focus.  The war is losing much domestic support because it only seems to be a drain on American lives and money, which it may very well be.  In order for any positive notions to come from this war a new strategy and focus must be initiated.\nIt should be reiterated that the war was declared in an effort to establish democracy for a country that otherwise could not do so on its own.  Through the media and various other reports, the American audience has generally gained the perception that the war is now senseless, meaningless, and pointless killings.  The other focus that could be expressed is the fight on terrorism which is also encompassed under the general umbrella of building a governmental structure promoting human rights and liberties.\nIt would also seem that the billions of dollars invested in the war could be better invested in domestic endeavors.  Poverty, education, and healthcare are just a few of the many problems in our country in addition to the large debt the government has run up.\nCertainly another point to look at, especially when considering whether or not to continue the war effort, is the success of the Iraqi people.  If we were to pull out and have only gone half-way in our effort to establish a civilized government, the people could easily crumble back into chaos without a firm foundation.  For this reason, I believe the government should reconsider its strategy with the war and figure out how to reallocate resources in a manner that will efficiently help the Iraqi people initiate their new government structure.  The efficiency would ideally entail a quick closing to the war effort so as to conserve our money that could be used domestically.  The efficiency would also still make sure the Iraqi people are properly aided in their independence effort.\n\n",
        "The Catholic Church is so different from other Christian religions in that it can be very strict and unforgiving in its policies.  Many of these policies are rooted in tradition, but are not applicable to a modern society.  The Catholic Church needs to loosen up its rules and be more accepting of new ideas, instead of clinging to old ones that do not necessarily fit in the modern world.\nOne example of such a problem is the requirement of the Catholic Church that priests be celibate.  This is a policy that is not rooted in scripture, but in tradition.  This may have been beneficial in the past, but seems really outdated in today’s world.  By asking priests to remain celibate in a world where the majority of people are not, the Catholic Church is separating its priests from the rest of society.  This contrast between priests and the rest of the world shows that the expectations of the Catholic Church are not consistent with the expectations of society.  The church should work in harmony with the society it serves, and not counteract it by advocating different values.  It does not fill well into modern society to require the celibacy of priests, and this is an area where the Catholic Church is very outdated and needs to make some changes.\nAnother area in which the Catholic Church has unrealistic views is in requiring priests to be males.  Today’s world promotes gender equality, as there has been a consistent movement towards the acquisition of women’s rights.  Society is trying to promote acceptance and tolerance, and in some ways the Catholic Church is doing this, but it other ways, it is shutting its doors based on outward representations, such as gender.  Not allowing females to become priests is undoubtedly a form of gender discrimination, which counteracts nearly every other movement in society which is working towards gender equality, especially in the workplace.\nThe Catholic Church has much room for improvement if they want to fit in with the society they serve and the society which serves them.  Religion exists for the people, but if people are living lives vastly different from the lives which the religion advocates, the people will not be able to fully experience their religion.  It will be beneficial for both the people and the Church itself for the Catholic Church to loosen its stringent policies and become more in-touch with the modern world. \n\n",
        "I believe that as citizens of the United States everyone is entitled to a certain level of privacy. But then again the right to privacy can be taken granted for. If everyone in this country were legitimate people and never attempted to wrong people in anyway the right to complete and total privacy of the citizens of the U.S. would be understood. But because we have people like the guy who killed innocent people at Virginia Tech., we have to constantly be apprehensive about the capability of certain people. However, I do think the idea think the idea of a National ID system is an excellent idea, as a means of keeping track of everyone in the U.S. but this goes to show that the government will always have some control over its people. And it’s the bad people that make living in this country so tiring for everyone else who are just trying to make a good life for themselves and their family.\n \nAlso I believe the companies and employers should gather as much information as possible on their employees so that they could use it fro possible networking but also if something were to happen like money was being stolen from the company, it would have a way of aiding to the capture of the culprit instead of taking extra time to find out their personal information. Nevertheless, there is always that one person that makes all of these ideas difficult to execute. Furthermore, although I do agree on the collection of all of this information, I do not agree on it to be open to any and everyone. I believe that if the information including medical information needs to accessed by any higher authority then a warrant is needed and if anyone needs to access someone’s information that they have no legal rights to then their needs to be extensive paper work and time to be put into receiving the information.\n\n",
        "Certainly the 20th century has brought a great deal more of conflict dealing with gender discrimination.  For the most part, it would seem, females and males were comfortable in their roles up until the events in the middle 1900s.  The movement to abolish gender discrimination is just as necessary as was the movement to end slavery and other forms of discrimination.  Whether you are a woman, a black person, a handicapped person, or any other person who has some sort of “physical difference”, that is by no means sound evidence to base discrimination on.\nThe 20th century, and now the 21st century, has seen a large push to unveil these discrimination and diversity issues:  companies have enacted diversity boards to oversee the diversity management and hiring of their workplaces and educational institutions have started affirmative actions plans to give the “tiebreakers” to the minority.  All of these steps are certainly necessary and are starting to change the value of diversity in this country and across the world from worthless to invaluable.\nDealing with the feministic movement, in particular, the reasons for erasing the prejudice are just as sound as erasing other forms of discrimination.  Having more females in upper management positions within companies or higher up position in an education institution allow a more rounded viewpoint on the best interests of those respective institutions moving forward.  How can a marketing firm truly meet all of the market segments without a sound female in an upper management role to see that the 50% or the market she has great knowledge on is best represented?  In only makes sense to put females, equally with males, in key decision making roles because their diverse thoughts will bring new perspectives and new ideas to the table that can only benefit in brain storming sessions and otherwise.\n\n",
        "            I am a member of the facebook.com.  For me it has been an open forum for meeting friends at my school, getting in touch with old high school friends, and of course maybe grabbing a screen name or a phone number of the cute girl that sits next to me in class.  However, last year one of my friends was suspended for one game of his lacrosse season because in one of his facebook pictures he was holding a beer and he is not of the age.  How did he get in trouble?  Our athletic director has a facebook account under some fake name and decided to check my friend’s pictures.  This is an invasion of privacy on multiple levels.  First of all he is using a false identity to look at pictures of college students he knows performing illegal deeds after the fact.  The police couldn’t even have arrested my friend for drinking but our AD can suspend him.  Moreover, where is the line to be drawn?  Our lives are already monitored to a heartbeat here at Loyola, we are given luxurious apartments along with freedom from our parents for the first time in our lives, and then immediately reprimanded by RA’s and prick resident directors for entertaining the idea of beer before we are 21. \n            That all being said I am in favor of finding out about a bomb threat through myspace.com.  As far as I am concerned if it saves lives it is alright by me.  That doesn’t mean I want my house to be wire tapped.  But if I had written on my front lawn that I am going to bomb a building than it would be ok to do some fly by surveillance.  Our government’s role is to protect and to serve its citizens, not to be overbearing and intrusive.  It is my belief that our president should have been impeached for his role in the wire tapping of certain American citizens following the terror attacks on 9/11.  It is just sad that our privacy had to be impinged upon as retaliation for our government not being informed enough about the acts that lead up to 9/11. \n            In our schools, privacy should be permitted to a certain degree where a principals or a deans discretion being used to make final decisions.  Lockers and emails should be accessible for investigation if need be, but under no circumstances should our phone conversations be recorded.  Myspace and facebook transcend both phone and email conversations.  They are open forums for freedom of speech for my generation.\n",
        "On the whole, I feel that the right to privacy is one of the most fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.  When it comes down to the battle between freedom and security, I think Benjamin Franklin said it best when he said “Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.”  We should be able to, as citizens, conduct our business and do what we want (within the restrictions of the law) without fear of being monitored by the government.  On this point, fine lines cannot be drawn.\nHowever, when it comes to genetic privacy, the lines are a little harder to see.  Sure, health insurance companies shouldn’t be allowed to see information about your family history, in order to either deny you coverage or raise your rates, but if there is genetic information that you are withholding, sometimes the fault is in your hands.  By this I mean, if you are applying for a high stress manual labor job and fail to tell your employers that you have heart problems (god knows why you would take this job if you had heart problems, bear with me) then how is this any different than withholding from your employers that you spent the last five years in jail, or that you are pregnant?  The point is, when you are applying for a job, your employer wants to pick the best person for the job, and does not want to pick someone who is more likely to have a health problem or just not be the right person.  This isn’t genetic discrimination, this is simply economics.  If an employer chooses a male over a female simply because he’s sexist and doesn’t think a female can do the job, that’s discrimination.  If he picks a male over a female because the female is six months pregnant and can only work 2 more before leaving for a year on maternity, that’s not.\nAm I trying to say that all our genetic information should be made public? No.  But finer lines have to be drawn and regulations must be made before taking any more steps towards the release of our DNA information.\n\n",
        "Personally, I do not think that the church needs to modernize or change its ways to adjust to society. I think that society should adjust to the ways of the church. The church was established a certain way, centuries ago and should be left as it is.\nI understand the concerns for the lack of young priests. It would not be my suggestion to allow priests to marry nor to allow women to become priests. I understand that it is not specifically stated anywhere that women cannot become priests, but I am not one for making this change. I also realize that men only became priests for some issue over land or something along those lines. As it seems, not Jesus, nor the religious councils seemed to care whether women became priests, but because of the land issues, whatever they are, priesthood was more suitable for men. I feel that women are better suited for the position of nuns. I am giving into gender stereotypes, but I feel the priest in being a man, is the stronger figure, while the nun, in being a woman, is the gentler figure. I guess it is hard for me to change something I am so used to and would prefer the church to remain as traditional as possible, even if that means not changing with modern times.\nAlso, I do not think that allowing priests to marry would decrease the acts of pediophilia. Some say that marriage would allow for a release of these urges, but in becoming a priest don’t they chose or learn to resist such urges? I think the problem is found in the character and discipline of some of these men. It is all too often that I hear of stories, whether they are from reliable sources like the news or from less reliable sources, like television programs, where pediophilia occurs in the least likely of places. Pediophilia can occur with a teacher, a married man, even family members. So, to say that allowing priests to marry would decrease the rates of pediophilia, is just not true. Allowing priests to marry may encourage more young men to become a priest, but I do not believe that it will have an impact on these disgusting sexual acts. Maybe priests should be required to take some sort of pyschological test before they can enter the priesthood, like police officers and FBI employees are required to take.\nI do feel for those who are restricted by the church, but every person has their own reason and can chose their own religion. I do not think they should try to change anothers religion just because they can not follow it. \n\n",
        "My theory on Iraq is that we are all in agreement that we have made a huge mistake, now we just have to focus on fixing it. Obviously many people, including myself are not happy with the way the current president is trying to run things, and I feel that really we just need a whole new group of people in the government with fresh ideas to help get us out of there. I understand that if we pull out now, it would be horrible because they are not quite ready to stand on thier own, but I feel as if we should be pulling out more then we are, to get them slowly acclimated. IF we pull out too soon then it could be disastorous though b/c then it could turn into a situation like when russia pulled out of afganistan too soon. Personally i feel, again, that our best bet is on a whole new administrative in the govt. who will have fresh ideas on how to get us out of this mess.\nWhat I find is funny is that we went over and are fighting in Iraq when the people who bombed us during september 11, were not even from there! They were from afganistan. So yeah…nice of our pres to start a war with the wrong country and masking his own desires to capture sadam by using september 11th as a cover up.\nI am glad though that we are not, as a country, make the same mistake that we did during the vietnam war in blaming our soldiers for this horrid mess, because it is not their fault.

But in the U.S. companies are allowed to gain access to any kind of personal information concerning employees that they can get their hands on, while in Europe such practices are much more strictly regulated.\n \n            I think that in the U.S., privacy rights are too often abused by the government, especially by such measures as the Patriot Act, passed and signed into law in October of 2001, which allowed government access to individual medical records, tax records, student records, etc., and expanded the ability of law enforcement to conduct secret searches.  That scares me. (I think Ben Franklin might be horrified too if he were still around)\n            To the best of my knowledge, when one applies for a job, he/she must inform the potential employer of any health problems that the applicant actually has – heart problems, some sort of disease, etc. – not what potentially could be wrong with him/her how every many years down the road.  I do not believe that employers or insurance companies should have access to individual genetic information.  There are certain genes that increase the likelihood of getting cancer and other diseases.  When health insurance agencies get a hold of tests that reveal such mutations, they turn down people who might never even get cancer.  But more importantly, if they turn down someone who does eventually get cancer, that poor individual will lack the health care coverage necessary to pay for exorbitant costs of treatment.  Knowing this, some people may decline to participate in genetic testing, and miss the opportunity to catch the disease before it even starts. \n\n",
        "The issue of privacy, as was shown by the discussion starter, bridges several realms of life:  including everything from the medical field to everyday conversations.  To make any sort of laws or protective sanctions for privacy rights is extremely difficult because the issue touches on so many different topics with different ramifications when misused in each.  There are, however, some generalizations that could or should be made in the realm of privacy.\nThe first thing to consider when speaking of privacy is the medium of communication.  The medium of communication is the means by which the message is sent.  Some examples might include phone, e-mail, or a website.  If the medium by which the information travels is an open one (meaning it is accessible to the general public) than the information can not be considered private.  If the message travels via a knowingly private means, such as telephone or e-mail, then the question of privacy becomes more complicated.  One must consider the means of communication when sending a message because it will dictate the actual privacy.  An example would be MySpace:  if a person were to post a message in their MySpace profile or to somebody else’s, that would be considered public.  The reason this is a public means of communication is that it is easily accessible to the general public without any special restrictions or security protecting the message.\nAnother factor to consider with the issue of privacy rights is the content.  For instance, if the content trying to be acquired was some social secret amongst friend, privacy will almost always win out.  In that case the information was not critical and did not necessarily harm anybody.  If, however, the information dealt with the live of another individual the content is much more pertinent.  When human safety is brought into the content and is being sought after, perhaps there is not such a right to privacy.  The greater right that could be destroyed in lieu of the right to privacy would be the right to life of the individual in the message.\n\n",
        "While I do feel that gender discrimination still exists in certain areas of today’s society, I think that we have definitely come a long way towards improving things.  In terms of the “feminism” movement, personally I agree with the fact that this movement made more sense a few decades ago.  It used to be that it was assumed that women would just stay home and be housewives, taking care of the children.  Now that most women are just as likely as men to pursue higher education, I feel that there is not much of a need in society for this sort of a feminist movement.  For those people who feel that men and women need to be equal in ALL regards, I disagree.  Men and women are physically different, and as a result, there are certain instances where men are just better suited for the task at hand.  For example, while some women might be up for (and perfectly capable of) being in the police force or soldiers in the armed forces, in most cases, men are better suited for these jobs. \nRegarding the corporate and academic worlds, I believe that women and men are equal in terms of their capabilities.  There is no reason why women should receive different salaries than men for performing the exact same duties.  While I think that men and women are able to perform at equal levels in the business world, I also believe that because of the discrimination that some women face, this can impact their ability to advance in their fields.  What I mean to say is that if there are certain male coworkers who look down upon the abilities of female employees, this could potentially impact the ability of the female to perform her duties to the utmost.  An example of this could be if managers see that the female employee does not have the respect of her male coworkers, these bosses might be less likely to promote the female to a management position, even though she has the necessary skills.   \n\n",
        "hoopdreams, your blog entry baffles me. although you do make some amazingly intellectual statements (such as pointing out that World War II was justified) and a nice history lesson about the real truth of how saddam hussien came to power (or, as you quipped, “our little Seddam”. like, LoL!!1!!), there is a blanket statement that just doesn’t coincide with the rest of your entry.  Now, its easy to see you’re taking every precaution to let the interweb know you are an smart, educated person with “liberal political ideologies” that is good at writing hip blog entries, but you let your guard down when you posted this:\n“…I would have been in agreement with any military assistance we could have provided during the Rwandan genocide that the Caucasian world never lost sleep over.”\nnow, i understand that sometimes these blog entries get a little tedious, and everyone is tempted to (if they don’t already) just type down the first 300 words that they can think of on the given topic.  but thinking that every single white person didn’t care about something as horrific as the Rwandan genocide? thats using the same logic that people do when they say all black people are good at basketball. its not the meaning of what you wrote that annoyed/offended me - i’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you meant something else - but how unintelligent of a statement it is in a blog entry full of intellectual quips. i would continue , but im not trying to sound intelligent, just prove a simple point. plus, arguing online is best summed up by this: http://cache.bordom.net/images/ba1c8cf1553955352def95c659544c9d.png\noh, and just for the record, the iraq war sucks - but everybody knows that.  even the people without “liberal political ideologies” who want to stay believe that its being run poorly right now. \n\n",
        "I believe that it is time for the Catholic Church to change its ways. We live in a society that is fast paced and always changing. It is time for the Catholic Church to update their beliefs to fit with what the current society needs.\nThese days we hardly ever here of young men entering the priesthood. Although still looked on as a position of respect, there are few who decide to devote their lives to it. Why is this? Many would argue that the Catholic Church does not have the following that it once did. In the generations that preceded us church was regularly attended every Sunday by most Catholics. Now, I can’t name more then a handful of people who still dedicate themselves to go every week. Can this lack of incoming priests be related to a lack of following?\nAnd what is causing this decline in faith? There are some practices of the church that are very outdated. The Catholic Church does not believe in birth control, but there are times when natural family planning is not going far enough. In the case of a woman, of childbearing age, who has four children and cannot support another, is her only choice abstinence? Also, the church does not condone the lifestyles of homosexual men and women. The gay community in America as well as other countries is rapidly rising. This goes back to our discussion on gay marriage. If it is decided that homosexuality is a genetically decided factor in our lives, is it fair to tell these men and women they can’t follow a particular religion?\nOn the other hand, the Catholic Church can’t be too quick to change (and they haven’t been.) If the Church changed their beliefs with every passing fad, no one would find the need to believe in it at all. But now, in our time, there are certainly some adjustments that could be made by the Catholic Church.\n\n",
        "Privacy rights have certainly become an important issue that we need to deal with in our lives today. Privacy rights are involved in many facets of our lives, from medical records, to national security, and everywhere in between. It is important that we are protected; however we do not want our rights to be suppressed.\nWith the new technology in our world today, we do not have the privacy that we think. Our cell phones, computers, and other devices of communication are open to the world. On the computer, anything that you do, whether it is through e-mail or a website such as facebook, can be seen by anyone on the internet. Our phones are also not as safe as private as they used to be. In an effort to keep our country safe, many of the calls that are made or received from overseas are being tapped. This effort is a step in the right direction, however is it infringing on our rights to listen to our everyday conversations?\nFrom a medical aspect, a patient’s privacy rights are very important. Medical information to a patient is only seen by those who they want it to be seen by. Often times this information may been needed to enroll in a school, or to apply for a job, but these institutions are bound by laws also to not release the information to anyone else.\nPrivacy rights are a way in which to help keep the people of our country safe. In many cases, if the person is doing nothing wrong, what does it matter if their moves are being monitored? Still though, some feel as though it is there right to keep things private. We need to be careful of the information that we put out into the world, because we can never be completely sure who can get their hands on it. \n\n",
        "When the Iraq War first began, I supported our stance in the conflict and truly believed that we had just cause to take action.  Saddam Hussein was a known evil dictator who used violence to cause fear and hold control over an entire people.  There was also the chance that Hussein was concealing weapons of mass destruction somewhere in the country.  What chance that was, we will never know.  And that is the question that matters, only because we did not find any WMDs.  The media has criticized the President for this decision after no WMDs, but I think the criticism is unfounded for several reasons. First, no one knows what intelligence the President had regarding WMDs in Iraq.  Perhaps he had gotten a strong piece of intel from a very trustworthy source that happened to be proven untrue.  Until we know what information he accessed to make his decision, we can not criticize.  Second, Hussein, with his fearsome army that still fights us toe to toe each day, must have owned thousands of different weapons depots located throughout Iraq.  If there was WMDs in Iraq before the war, Hussein could have easily given the order to have them moved out of the country or disassembled a second after being notified of our imminent invasion on CNN.  Even after we first invaded, there was not nearly enough man power to search each and every depot in Iraq.  Even now, they may not have searched every one.  And all this time, a WMD could have been snuck out while the war went on.  Third, Saddam Hussein is evil!  His removal from power is a great gift bestowed upon the world by the United States.  To make a stretch of a comparison, Iraq is not unlike Somalia!  In both cases, an evil force bent on greed was committing the crime of genecide and would have continued if no one stepped in. \n\n",
        "While gender discrimination is something that should always be avoided ideally, there are some problems I have with the issue in general. \n As the discussion starter states, discrimination because of sex is defined as adverse action against another person, that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex.  However, how is it possible for someone to determine with absolute certainty that the “adverse action” was caused entirely by sex, and had no other factors.  In an ideal world, gender discrimination can be pointed out in an action where every single factor amongst two parties of opposite sex are the same except for gender.  However, it is obvious that this is not an ideal world. Therefore, no one can ever say for sure if any action is pure gender discrimination or not. For clear cut situations that meet the ideal world’s standards, then action should be taken to avoid gender discrimination by all means. However, the vast majority of situations will be those that are not ideal, and the entire issue is clouded because of this fact.\nOne large factor in the development of the issue of gender discrimination is the rise of the feminist movement from the 1960s to the present.  A main goal of the feminist movement is to close the gap of differences between men and women so women receive equal opportunities as men.  However, since the feminist movement began, the connotation of the typical feminist has evolved into a hatred for the entire male population.  Thus, through all of their efforts to close this gender-based gap, they only widen the very gap they are attempting to close.  Also, by stressing the need for women to “get out of the kitchen” and enter the workforce, and basically take on the same role as the male parent, feminism is removing an integral piece of the balanced household.  If a couple has children, whether the mother stays home and nurtures them or drops them off at a day care center each morning for the duration of the day has an enormous impact on the development of that child. \n\n",
        "I have mixed feelings on the Catholic Church.  Most of the reason for this is because I don’t really care at all about it.  I don’t like religion on a whole, basically believing that if one wants a relationship with God, it should be more personal and less through a religious institution.  That being said, I believe however that the church is very useful for some people, and has done a great many good things for many people.  It’s just not for me.\nIf i were to join a religious group however, I would not join the Catholic Church.  It is too ritualistic and traditionalist for my liking, and a little too conservative policy-wise.  When it comes down to issues, though, I don’t really care about whether or not they have female priests, or if priests can get married and have children.  It’s not my business to tell the pope or priests what they should do.  Besides, I feel that it is necessary in any situation to have people on both sides of issues.  I mean, if we didn’t have liberals and conservatives in America, we wouldn’t be the same country.  Argument between progressivism and traditionalism is absolutely necessary to make progress.  I don’t really like liberals or conservatives, I think they are both wrong and full of crap, but I’m glad we have both of them.  I feel the same with the church.  I don’t like the Catholic Church, but I feel it is necessary to have them, and to have a more conservative, traditional church so that newer, more liberal churches do not forget about the history of Christianity.\nHowever, what I do have a problem with is how big the Catholic Church is.  Most Catholics believe they are the “true” Christianity and don’t believe that other branches in the World Council of Churches are as Christian as they are.  This is completely wrong.  While I would certainly like to throw some branches of Christianity out (like Jehovah’s Witnesses or Baptists)  I feel like certain weight should be placed on the influence of both the Catholic Church and other churches of the world.  And with how many times the Catholic church has screwed up over the years, it really shouldn’t be acting like hot shit.  It ain’t.  Basically what I’m trying to say is: If the catholic church isn’t willing to change, maybe they should stop acting like they are the most important people on the world in Gods eyes.  I don’t really know how to word what I’m trying to say here, but I hope it’s understand. \n\n",
        "The war in Iraq has become one of the most talked about issues in our world today. The “war on terror” has been criticized as having gone on too long. Many Americans think that we have lost our focus overseas and could be focusing on conflicts that are more of a threat to our safety.\nWe have been over in Iraq for over four years now. I don’t believe that it would be beneficial to the United States to completely remove ourselves at this point in time. We are staying in Iraq to help them establish a democracy, but is democracy a far-fetched goal? We have eliminated Saddam Hussein’s power over the Iraqi people, but how do we know when we have helped enough?\nWith a change of President in our immediate future any drastic movement in Iraq would not be smart. Furthermore, it is easier for us to make judgments because we do not know all of the information about what is going on in Iraq. There are large numbers of American troops currently in Iraq and I think that it is time for them to start to come home. I believe that Iraq still needs governmental guidance, but maybe we could do so without keeping all of our troops there. Every day there are innocent people dying, but do these soldiers even know exactly what they are fighting for?\nLeaving now would leave the people with no hope. We will have successfully freed them from their oppressor, but we have not established a strong government to take control. Although we have done much in ways to help their freedom, there is still much more that can be done. Its just a matter of how much longer this will go on, and how many more lives will “need” to be taken.\n\n",
        "I believe the war in Iraq was a huge mistake that America got itself caught up in due to politicians taking advantage of the country’s emotional response to 9-11. The whole thing originally started out as a hunt for Osama bin Laden, and then grew and grew until it involved invading Iraq. Emotions were built upon and played on every step of the way, making it seem as if waging an all out war in a foreign country with little support was the next logical step.\nNot only was the decision to go to war in Iraq not well supported, it was not well planned. There were no definite goals besides “Get Saddam out of power!”, no plan for rebuilding the shattered government and economy of the country we invaded. This is why we find it now difficult to pull out – because we’re still not sure we’ve accomplished what we went in for. Yes, Saddam has been executed for his horrendous crimes, but is the state of Iraq any better than before we came? On the contrary, it’s even worse. Like many other Americans, I was under the impression that the entire reason for the war was to make the world safer. Well, as far as I can see, invading Iraq hasn’t done a thing. Terrorist attacks will always happen, and the best defense against them is not invading any country which spawns them, but rather continuing what we have done to heighten security at our country’s most vulnerable points. So the war in Iraq has not bettered the world yet – has it bettered Iraq? From what I hear in the news, Iraq is in more turmoil and conflict than it was under Saddam’s entire reign. Who was the war in Iraq supposed to help?\nI agree that something had to be done about Saddam Hussein, and that trying to oust him from power was an admirable goal. But we went in practically alone, removed a foreign country’s system of government and tried to institute our own in its place. I think what the Bush administration didn’t account for in this “plan” was that Iraq has a completely different culture from our own, and that forcing a policy of democracy on them when their own society is so heavily ingrained with tradition and religion is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. I believe the only solution now is to plan out a gradual withdrawal of troops from Iraq, with definite timeframes (at least to shoot for as goals). We are the glue that holds together the government in Iraq right now, and hopefully if we withdraw slowly and completely a new force from within will rise and take our place to hold everything together. \n\n",
        "My home town is made up of working women and stay at home moms. My mother is a part time worker and full time mother. I do not feel the people around me have experienced gender discrimination but choose their occupations. Some families are not lucky enough to be able to survive on one income, some can, and others choose to have multiple incomes. I think it is great that women have progressed and are able to have an equal chance in the work world. At the same time, I feel that some women feminists condemn those that CHOOSE to stay at home. In my opinion staying at home is an equally respectable job that requires hard work and talent.\nMy aunt was a special education teacher until she became a full time mother with three kids. Her eldest has graduated college, her middle is a freshman in college, and her youngest is thirteen. She has decided to go back to teach as a substitute for elementary school children. In my opinion, my cousin’s have become decent members of society. As I mentioned before, my mother worked part- time and was a full time mother. She continues to work in order to pay for our education. I feel that my brothers and I have turned out as responsible and respectable individuals. I believe a woman’s choice is very important. The fact that my mother and aunt were able to choose what they wanted to do is a luxury many women may not have.\nI feel that a woman’s role can be somewhat underestimated and looked down upon by females in the working field. One can not know what something is like until they experience it. Working women should not criticize stay at home moms. Stay at home moms should not criticize working women. Each person satisfies their special needs by spending their time differently. I applaud women feminists for their hard work in battling oppression against our gender. Luckily I have not experienced gender discrimination, but do understand that it exists. \n\n",
        "            Debates over laws that forbid certain kinds of marriages are not unique to our generation.  There was also a time in U.S. history when a large number of state governments outlawed marriage between African Americans and Caucasian Americans.  These laws, based on discrimination and injustice, were eventually abolished.  I can’t help but feel that the exclusion of gays from the institution of marriage is simply another form of discrimination that must be done away with as well.  And I think that the rulings in Vermont, Massachusetts, and New Jersey that have legalized civil unions (in Massachusetts, marriage itself), have started a trend that will continue to spread to other states.\n            There’s no such thing as an ideal family, and there’s certainly no such thing as a typical family.  What is important is that children grow up in safe environment where they are loved and supported – it doesn’t matter who is doing the loving and supporting.  And yet, too often adoption agencies refuse to allow gay couples to adopt children together.\n            How can someone argue that the purpose of the institution of marriage is procreation when so many couples choose, when they get married, not to have children and use various forms of birth control to ensure this?\n \n            I have of course been discussing marriage in its legal sense, as a part of secular society.  The Church, as so many Americans gladly boast, is separate institution from the entity of the state.  According to Roman Catholic beliefs, the one of the purposes of sex, which should only occur in marriage, is procreation.  Therefore not only does the church not allow gay marriage, but it also forbids the use of birth control (other than natural family planning).  I feel that critics of the Catholic Church often use the recent priest scandals as an excuse to attack any principle or doctrine of the Church.  Yes, these atrocities deserve all the amount of horror, outrage, and damnation that they have received and perhaps some more.  But the actions of imperfect, fallible priests should not take away from the teachings of the Catholic faith itself. \n\n",
        "The Big BF (Ben Franklin) said it best: “Those who would sacrifice essential liberties for a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.” I don’t think the government has the right to apply numbers to its populace essentially for the purpose of tracking them. We already have social security numbers, which function in place of our names on all kinds of documents and assorted, meaningless pieces of paper. The idea that our government would have the initiative or the wherewithal to institute a national ID system on top of all the paper pushing they already do is extreme and pointless.\nThe idea of a federal centralized data bank monitoring a national ID system also runs counter to the forgotten notion that some things are simply the prerogative of the state governments. In most cases, it’s the job of the individual states to track criminals who have committed crimes within their borders. To create a federally controlled system would once again strip away rights that essentially (and constitutionally) belong to the states.\nIf this weren’t enough, a national ID system would be functionally useless, anyway. Mtnbike9 made a very important point about how easy it is to forge identity information. Creating a database of national ID numbers would be a way to spend millions of dollars to put one small hurdle on the track for those who want to commit terrorist acts or serious crimes. It also presupposes that anyone who commits a crime can be easily tracked; just because a person has a number attached to their name doesn’t mean you’ll be able to find them, and thieves, murderers, and terrorists don’t shout out their names and ID numbers before committing crimes. The only purpose and ID bank would serve is as a tracking system for people the government wants to monitor in advance of crimes, but a.) the government already has several such numbers it applies to its citizens and uses them frequently, and b.) the system would just become another expensive, logistical nightmare. We live in bureaucracy already. Let’s not just give them more little pieces of paper to file, since that’s about all a national ID system would be. \n\n",

ID’s can always be faked; no matter how “good” we think they are.  There is a whole franchise devoted to making fake ids.\nThen we have “medical confidentiality”.  Should anyone have the right to discuss your medical history? If we start letting out peoples medical secrets there will be chaos.  It’d be like putting people’s religion out for all to see.

        "I just got here, didn't realize we were starting\n\nWell the country was divided about half and half in support for the war at some point, right? \n\nBut we are there now. I feel like if we pull out, the situation will get even worse.\n\nFor what reason? Oil? \n\nI think so. \n\nHow do we know what intelligence the government may have had, though? \n\nAlso, I don't understand why it is such a surprise that we didn't find any there. I'm sure Hussein had thousands of depots, any of which could have had WMDs. Right when we were invading, he just had to give the order to move them out of the country. \n\nRight after the invasion, the media was making such a big deal about how we hadn't found any. Yet with the amount of man power we had in Iraq, it was probably physically impossible to search every single depot.\n\nSo I don't think we went in for wrong reasons. Hey, no WMDs went off since then. :) \n\nOf course \n\nI think we have gotten ourselves into a bad situation. If we stay, the country is torn apart over here, we keep losing people over there, and the mission is going nowhere. If we pull out, the situation will only get worse. \n\nI think they should lay out some clear-cut objectives and realistic overall goals. Otherwise, if the war is going nowhere, we have to choose the lesser of two eveils and pull out. \n\nBeing consistent? \n\nWell what are they doing over there right now? Just expanding out and controlling different towns? \n\nHeh\n\nWhat benefits are we getting from Iraq? We're not actually using the oil yet \n\nBesides the economic benefits of war itself \n\nWell hmm... I guess since we are trying to impose our democracy on them \n\nWell hmm... I guess since we are trying to impose our democracy on them \n\nclockwatcher I'm confused... I was trying to say it might be like modern day colonialism since we are imposing democracy on them\n\nSo why in Iraq? \n\nOk\n\nOkay rocks, you're saying there must be some reason for our continued presence there besides democracy? \n\nOnce its safe enough to take oil out of the country \n\nSo basically, you guys think we are just staying in Iraq until we can take the oil out, and we don't really care about establishing a democracy there? \n\nrocks, explain \n\nI'm not sure, I never actually thought of that, clock\n\nI don't think we can legitimately say we went in for the wrong reasons.\n\nUnless we see every piece of intel the government collected about Iraq and WMDs, we can't make any claims about the legitimacy of our going there.\n\nThats how I feel at least\n\nlol Nope \n",
        "well that seems more like reverse discrimination \n\nbecause they wanted to benefit from looking like female-owned business\n\nyes, that's true \n\nyes i would say so \n\nit's usually referred to as reverse discrimination because it helps people who are usually discriminated against, but in doing so, it does discrimintate\n\nreally?\n\nyeah i agree with that \n\ni think the reason it's not as big as it used to be is because people are making a conscious effort against it\n\nlike people are more aware of it now \n\nprobably not \n\nbut it is still possible to go further than we have come so far \n\nbut i do think it exists in the workplace \n\nwell certain fiels are still dominated by males \n\nsciences particularly \n\nthings like engineering \n\nand then some jobs are considered too flowery for males \n\nlike nursing \n\nexactly\n\nbroadly speaking, possibly \n\nbut people generalize to think that given a woman, she can't do a man's job, even though she may be an instance of a person who is more capable than most men \n\neven if the broad generalizations are true, people shouldn't assume anything about a particular person based on their gender \n\nyeah but that's still not accounting for the few women who might be just as good or better \n\nif you generalize like that, you'll miss even the few good ones \n\nwhat do you mean? \n\nyeah, that could and probably does happen \n\nyeah, i think the hardest thing is to differentiate between someone being selected for a job because of their abilities versus their gender \n\nit can easily be misconstrued \n\nwell what if gender is a factor? \n\ni would still consider that discrimination \n\nright, or only hiring minorities \n\nwhich is discrimination in its own way \n\nwell in the same way that it may be harder for women to get certain jobs, it's hard for them to advance in those jobs \n\nit is definitely true for the same jobs, which is where it's the biggest problem\n\nthe problem with people getting raises is that there's no clear qulaifications for getting to the next pay stage \n\nwell it's definitely true, sad as that may be\n\nwell the higher the salary, the bigger the difference would probably be \n\nmore room for disparity \n\nthat does probably have a lot to do with it, but since it is a general trend, the context thing might not be that important because you would expect those difference to even out \n\nif you were only comparing two hospitals, then the context would be a big deal, but i don't think it's that important if you see a wage gap in the big picture \n\nwhy would you think the opposite?\n\nyes, because if people's salaries differed by even one percent, that would be so minor for a minimum wage salary, but it would be significant for someone making six digits \n\nwell i think even in the same company, things like that happen \nyes, and its easy to tell the difference by comparing salaries \n\nit's very concrete evidence \n\nwell like before we said it will probably never be completely fixed \n\ndo you think something like affirmative action will work or just make the problem worse? \n\nwell specific things about race \n\nlike i know african-americans can run faster \n\ni don't know how much is known about job abilities \n\nthat's definitely gender discrimination \n\nno offense, but it doesn't take superior mental skills to make a pizza \n\nthere's nothing particular about males that would make them better pizza-makers\n\nyeah, it probably would be eaiser for them to get away with, but its still just as bad\n\nyeah, well i think noting it would be a good idea on the part of the government \n\nso people don't try to get away with as much \n\nwell a business could face something like that \n\nor even lose their business if they refuse to change \n\nyeah, i hadn't thought of it that way, but it is important to keep govt out of business if possible \n\nyeah, i can't believe people would even attempt that \n\nsure\n\n\n\n\n\n",

does anyone else think they have any sort of generalizations on the topic yet \n\nIm not sure I understand how they could give them detention \n\nI do not agree with that \n\nI think the school can only control students within their jurisdiction within school property or school sanctioned trip off of property \n\nDetention was not right \n\nthey did nothing wrong at school \n\nSure\n\nInteresting, first off though, I think those sites should be blocked\n\nAt school\n\nDoes not really seem to be his right to do so \n\nSorry\n\nYes, that is not his job \n\nNot all websites \n\nYes\n\nYou can block those sorts of things, downloads and access\n\nI am with Janada in the fac that a simply, sophisticated upfront job on the IT side of things could have mitigated all of these problems \n\nAIM express \n\nTrue\n\nyou can always find ways to deviate from the education \n\nThey should \n\nYes\n\nThey can do all they want, but it takes the will of the student for any of it to work \n\nThey can cut distractions to aide in that, but it is still ultimately up to the student \n\nYes\n\nThat's an example of the educators promoting education to the students\n\nIf that's your choice, yes \n\nWhat's your point \n\nI've lost your point here \n\nMy school did not have rules against me walking the halls for 50 minutes during my free periods \n\nNo he's saying just because there are rules does not mean you cant do it \n\nYou get caught, those are the consequences \n\nRight\n\nbut it is up to the student whether or not to adhere \njust having rules does not guarentee everyone will follow \n\nAlright, so what is the issue here \n\nI know, I was just asking in general \n\nAlright, I agree with that \n\nbest way to mitigate it to block that stuff upfront \n\nMy final thought, as we discussed, is that there must be some jurisdiction set to the establishment under which internet or other infromation is used.

        "yes \n\nwhat?\n\noh i see \n\nbut that's different from gay marriage \n\ni have a question \n\nshould gay marriage be a national issue, or decided state by state M\n\nas of right now i believe, Vermont and New Jersey allow civil unions \n\nand Massachusettes allows full marriage \n\ni don't think there's really much of a difference at all \n\nif anything, the institution of straight marriage is falling apart \n\nthe divorce rate is over 50% \n\nin this country \n\nits okay for marriage under state \n\nbut then it becomes more difficult if you talk about it within the Church \n\nthe people who belong to it \n\ni think prejudice is even more of an issue in our society \n\nthere used to be laws against marriage between blacks and whites\nthere's still a lot of prejudice present against that today \n\nand i think its a similar isuue with gay marriage \n\nI don't think the Church will ever allow gay marriage, at least, I don't think the Catholic Church will, but i thin, the more important issue is gay marriage in a legal sense \n\nwhich is still not allowed throughout most of the country \n\nthat is the view of the Church \n\nhmm, i think we're all on the same page then about gay marriage under the state \n\nas do I \n\nperhaps if the Church was more more open and accepting, there wouldn't be such scandal \n\nwith the sexual abuse of young boys i mean \n\nwell everything about us is a combination of genetics and culture \n\nWe're a product of the interaction between our genes and our environment\n\nwell, some try to hide it... but i think we were in agreement that someones doesn't choose to be gay \n\nno, but I have gay friends \n\nwell, definitely, prejudice is taught \n\nwhat's your opinion about children being raised by a gay couple? \n\nmost straight marriages end in divorce anyway \n\npeople talk about protecting the sanctity of marriage when they oppose gay marriage, but to be honest, i don't really see that much sanctity left anyway\n\nthe way people treat it these days \n\nwe won't know unless they're allowed to get married \n\nthe point is they should be given the same chance as straight people\n\nwhat do you mean? \n\nlol \n\nwait, what? i'm sorry, what do you mean? \n\ni agree \n\ni think its absurd \n\ni'm glad it wasn't successful \n\ni don't think that banning gay marriage is something that Bush should be concerned with at the moment \n\nI think that he has bigger problems \n\nthat he should deal with \n\nI think one of the big problems with this issue is the legal disadvantages faced by gay couples \n\nfor example, gay people aren't allowed spousal confidentiality during a trial \n\nand problems arise when trying to adopt children \n\ngood question \n\ni have no idea, lol \n\nwhere there are still arranged marriages and stuff like that\n\nyes\n\nbut then again, the interests of some people are against gay marriage\n\ndon't really know the statistics \n\nbut ultimately, I don't see much difference from bans against marriage between African Americans and whites, I think prejudice plays a big part in people\n\npeople's opposition \n\nPeople used to argue that it would be difficult for mulatto children to fit into society \n\nlike people now argue that it will be hard for the children of gay people to fit into society \n\ni think that just shows that we need to change our society \n\noh, i wasn \n\n\nah, sorry \n\ni wasn't talking about slavery \n\njust blacks and whites not being allowed to marry \n\nGay marriage should be legalized, an amendment banning gay marriage would be a deprivation of their rights \n\nyes, society needs to change \n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "and im done \n\nwhy should businesses with women and minorities as heads more easily get money? \n\nwell we probably shouldnt just give out money to whoever we feel sorry for\n\nbecause then...we wouldnt have any money \n\nexactly like affirmative action \n\nhow is this \"affirmative action for women\" leveling the playing field tho? \n\nso whats the world gonna be like when black women get paid more than men just because of their race/gender, not because of the amount of work they do\n\naff. action is forcing it \n\nthe other way is time \n\neventually, with subsidizing city schools and giving everyone equal opportunities, plus anti-racist teaching, hopefully in future generations racism and gender inequalities will disappear \n\nbut we cant do what were doing now \n\ni mean it will never die out completely \n\nbut eventually it will helplevel the playing ground \n\nyou keep saying ego, im not sure if thats the right word... \n\nmaybe bias is the word, or gender stereotype \n\nanyway, there are many reasons that gender discrimination exists, and it shouldnt be the govt's job to fix these by just giving businesses money who give them important jobs \n\nthe govt has screwed up, men have screwed up, feminists have definitely screwed up they havent really done jack \n\ni mean feminists today have failed and instead of promoting gender equality they tend to project an image that they want to be men, and havent ending up solving anything \n\ninstead, now they are just anti-male \n\nexactly\n\ni mean, feminists like mary daley believe that the world would be better off if there were just dramatically less men on the planet \n\ni dont know, ask the feminists \n\nthat is changing though \n\nlol there are plenty of places for women...like the kitchen, the laundry room, the bedroom.... \n\nits not our fault our brains are twice the size of yours \n\nof course the topic we started on was that businesses get more money for employing females \n\nwell then governments role should be to monitor businesses not give them money\n\nlol the govt gives out a lot more money than just for businesses on the verge of bankruptcy \n\ngovt gives out money as incentives when the want businesses to do things\n\nwhile i agree that subsidies are fine \n\nwell generally the govt offers money as incentive, so if you dont want to do what they want, you just wont get the money \n\nwell thats what i was saying, i believe they should be out of the economic world almost completely \n\nthe govt, that is \n\nnot women \n\nso were agreed that the government sucks at solving things...\n\ni just have to say \n\nmaybe women would be making more progress in the workplace if they didnt wear such skanky clothes all the time \n\nhaha you better \n\nthats all i have to say about that \n\n\n",
        "I was against it for a while, but I eventually decided there is no reason for it to be illegal \n\nThe government really has no authority in deciding what is and is not marriage.\n\nHmm... \n\nWell I changed my mind after I thought about it for a while lol \n\nObviously that is still the case, but since it is not the choice of the individual to be gay, I don't think they should be denied love just because they were born a certain way. \n\nTrue\n\nIf it were the choice of the individual, it would be different, yes. If everyone chose to be gay, then noone would reproduce. And we can't have that. \") \n\nWell hey, if you really want to think far into this.... if you say it is okay to do something, then you have to say it is okay for EVERYONE to do it \n\nCrash, I think we are hypothetically thinking that being gay is a personal choice, yes \n\nThe gay gene \n\nTheres a talk here about it, I assume they have found it? \n\nYep \n\nHey, I have a question. Do you think the government has the right to decide what a real \"marriage\" is? And where does religion fall in\n\nI don't believe it is a personal choice either. It wouldn't make any sense for it to be personal choice. Who would choose a life of discrimination? \n\nAnd have to go through the whole process of revealing it to your parents and everything. \n\nyeah goldeneye...especially if you go back father into history when it was SO much more socially unacceptable \n\nWell.... go back far enough and it was commonly practiced as well. \n\nIt would make a lot more sense to me for it to be genetic. There would not be nearly as many homosexuals if it were not\n\nTherefore, it is like any other trait, and should not be discriminated against. \n\nlol \n\nThe gay gene! \n\nI have to go to that talk lol I'm interested to know \n\nOh \n\nlol \n\nso hey... answer my question \n\nDo you think the government has the right to decide what a real \"marriage\" is? And where does religion fall in? \n\nI am thinking more of just a union. I never thought about the legal implications, really. \n\nIf gay marriage is okay, then I think it should be the same process as straight marriage. If you do not allow homosexuals to get married \"legally,\" but allow them to just be in a \"union\" or whatever, it still is NOT equal. \n\nIt's just kind of... shutting them up. \n\nThe Catholic Church is working on celibacy and female priests right now, I believe.\n\nIs that true? \n\nAh \n\nSo is there anyone opposed to gay marriage here? I heard someone say it before. If so, lets get some debate going! \n\nI feel like they should not have the right to \"decide,\" however. \n\nThey should just \"provide\" the process. \n\nYes\n\nThey never had to \"endorse\" straight marriage. It was always, naturally, there. Therefore, there should be no debate. As long as being gay is genetic, it is not something that should be discriminated against. \n\nWell, what gives them the right to decide it is \"wrong,\" if it is not by choice. \n\nProviding the process involves no moral judgment, which I believe they have no right to make in an issue like this one. \n\n(did that make sense?) \n\nwhat sort of environmental factors? \n\nHey, my parents are divorced, and I grew up in a house with all women. I turned out just fine, I think.\n\nIs that the kind of thing we mean? \n\nNot having both sexes around\n\n? \n\nrocks, what do you mean? \n\nWell that goes back to whether it is genetic or not \n\nI do believe that people (teenagers, especially) can be influenced by something like that, and either become confused or, trying to be rebellious, \"think\" that they are gay. \n\nYes clockwatcher, to me it would. \n\nIf it is proven to be just a choice and nothing more, then I say cut it out. \n\nIt is not \"natural\" then, not something that is in your nature (your genetic code!). \n\nIf it is genetic, then that is just horrible, horrible torture for anyone to go through. \n\nWell, then again, even it is genetic, I think a person can get confused during hard times in their life.\n\nRight, even if someone is confused, I guess it would be better for them to discover their true feelings on their own. \n\nOr maybe with the gay gene, there will be a way to test it\n\nWhat if someone does not have the gay gene and wants to be gay? Should that person's parents seek psychiatric help for him/her? \n\nDefinitely\n\nThanks.\n\nI think I would say yes. \n\nBecause, again, it is not \"natural\" for that person. \n\nWell, I was assuming it was a proven gene that could be tested without a doubt. \n\nBeing gay is A-okay! Hurray! \n\n",

        "As long as they don't use any information collected for any other reason besides terrorism, I think that is fine. \n\nWell myspace is public information. \n\nYeah, I don't have a problem with the NSA gathering that information. It depends on how they use it, however.\n\nIf they say they are collecting it for a certain noble cause, like the prevention of terrorism, I am okay with it. As long as that information has no chance of going public, and will not be used for any other purpose. \n\nWell, privacy rights in general. Like Loyola using Facebook, for instance. \n\nWell then I am okay with it. I will give up some of my rights for a greater cause. \n\nIs anyone against the patriot act? \n\nwhat do you guys think about loyola's use of Facebook\n\n?\n\nI believe any pictures on facebook containing \"illegal activities\" can incriminate the people in them. (Am I wrong?) \n\nInteresting point \n\nI was just thinking that! \n\nUnless there is a sign behind you that says a room number or something... \n\nBut that could not be used as evidence against a person for a specific event \n\nWe said that pictures can only be used as evidence in a specific case, but there is no way to link a picture to that case, right? \n\nWell, regardless, I think that the use of facebook is an invasion of privacy. \n\nmyspace IS public. Facebook is meant to be a means of communication amongst students from a particular school. \n\nBut a person on facebook can choose to keep it private, no? \n\nAh, I don't use myspace. \n\nWell, if a myspace/facebook is set to be private (amongst a certain group of individuals), I believe it's wrong to use any information from that source. \n\nOn the other hand, if you have a public myspace or anything of the sort, I think that is public information. \n\nWell, as I said, we're giving up our rights for a noble cause.\n\nThe Patriot Act is a bit different than a college using Facebook to catch kids drinking. \n\nExactly.\n\nAgain, I think it depends if the information is public or not\n\nAny information considered public, I believe anyone can use against you for any reason. If you are declaring something to the world, why complain when it comes back to bite you? \n\nWell the entire internet is not considered public, really\n\nNo, it shouldn't be public\n\nJust like when you put in credit card information online or something. It is not public just because it is on the internet\n\nDefinitely.\n\nI agree \n\nI know, what I mean is that we have found an issue where a certain giving up of rights is permissible on grounds of preventing terrorism. I think, however, in the future the line between the importance of privacy and crime prevention will become obscured.\n\nThat is what is up for debate, I suppose. \n\nRight.\n\nWell, obviously I think the answer is yes. It's just interesting to consider how certain situations can simply trivialize our rights\n\nHey, how about the example of the letter found in the locker that prevented a school shooting? \n\nThe problem is that, if we say something like that is permissible, we throw our privacy rights out the window. (I'm assuming the school had just found that letter, and did not get any tips about a school shooting) \n\nUnless there is cause to believe something will be found in a locker, I don't think it is ethical to search\n\nrocks, do you mean in a school environment? \n\nOh, okay. Yeah, I would agree with that\n\nLegally, yes. \n\nTo me, anyway.\n\nWell, actually, whatever you put in your locker could be considered public then, in that case. Just like the internet discussion we had. \n\nright.\n\nForced invasion or privacy?\n\nOf\n\nLike a letter?\n\nPerhaps they care more that their rights are being ignored more than the actual personal items found in the locker, though\n\nNicole?\n\nHaha\n",
        "YES\n\nin reality, i don't think it will ever go away entirely \n\nsorry ladies \n\ni'm sure it does \n\nyes\n\nand yet again \n\ni have a personal experience \n\ni'm a dude

all the tiem (not the actual case though) \n\nvery true\n\n do you think that there is something wrong with some of those?\n\nfor instance, most womens voices are more \"pleasant\" on the phone\n\nnaturally, they make good secretaries \n\nfor that reason i mean) \n\nand that's not in a discriminatory way either, like with construction, the men are just built for it \n\nyeah, there are some big ladies out there also \n\ni don't understand that \n\nis that just insecurity or something? \n\nmaybe since men are naturally stronger, they feel inferior for some reason? \n\nwell women are psychologically stronger apparently \n\nand i can totally see that \n\ni will agree to that in a heartbeat \n\ni don' tthink that women should be drafted \n\nyeah, depends on the guy \n\ni'm one of the few that wouldn't mind \n\n(and i'm not trying to act macho by saying that) \n\nthere is \n\nmy dad was drafted for vietnam and then got denied \n\nfor some problem he had \n\nyeah, the whole drafting women thing is very controversial \n\ni mean, i personally don't think that they should be since they naturally aren't cut out for it as men, but if they want to be equal, then they should be treated as equals\n\ni'm like at a standstill \n\nso do you mean that the draft should count for women, and a lot should get denied, but the few capable ladies should go on? \n\nbut also with infants, the woman can't go because of natural needs of the baby \n\nbut if they want to be equal, then all of them should \n\nthat's like giving them an advantage \n\nwell wait a second \n\nwhat about earlier when we said that women are psychologically stronger? \n\n(generally...) \n\njust throwing it out there... \n\nlol\n\nthat's a terrific point \n\nnot good....terrific....good job \n\nlol \n\nbut yeah, but if we continue to look at it that way, then they'll never be treated equally \n\ni think that they will definitely be treated equally in daily life, etc., but in different areas they'll never be \n\ndaily life including things such as jobs, etc. like the CEO bit you were talking about right then \n\nespecially since CEO positions don't need muscle \n\nyeah, totally \n\ni think it means that everyone, including all females able, will go in for the draft\n\nlike we said earlier, only the ones able will go on \n\nlike the girls that can't do a pushup won't...but it's also the same way for guys \n\nit all goes back to stereotypes in reality \n\nmen are more intimidating than women, which is also why you see them in these high ranking positions everywhere \n\nyeah, and even though some men can't do the pushups, more men than women can \n\nwell i think now a days women are also just about, if not equal to men in ambition \n\nhell, i can't do 50 pushups \n\nlol\n\ni mean damn, im a stringbean \n\nwell.... \n\nraces are \"equal,\" but they're not actually equal \n\nyou know what i mean? \n\nwell i think they already are respected just as much if they're in the military\n\ni mean, yeah, their physical tests are easier, but that's just allowing nature to take its course since women \"cant do those 50 pushups”\n\nyeah, ability should determine the equality, i mean, we obviously shouldn't look down upon people who can't do as much as others, but yeah, i agree in the workplace that people should only advance if they well deserve it\n\nfrogger, you mean like sitcoms? \n\nif you mean like sitcoms, then yeah, it does put them to a disadvantage\n\nbut on the other hand, it is our natural course, of say like how women are more nurturing \n\nfor some reason, i'm thinking of Home Improvement right now\n\nlet's compare that to Full House \n\ni think those are two good things to compare \n\nfor instance, tim allen works with tools while whoever his wife is is more of the nurturing character \n\nbut then look at bob saggot in full house of how he's very feminine and cleans and vaccuums, but on the other hand, he can't play sports or do physical labor worth crap \n\nbut in sitcoms the natural tendency is like home improvement\n\ni've only watched like 2 episodes \n\nthat's society turning things around, showing that, since it's more of a recent show, how views have been, and are continuing to change \n\ni think they do though- because of what little....just said, and it portrays the views of society quite well \n\ni agree \n\n(dave chapelle....) \n\nLol\n\nsorry, i had to \n\nthis guy totally meant it \n\nwell, not that he meant it, but that's how he talks \n\nhe's a southern man \nbrought up through the south in the 60's and 70's \n\nisn't he buds with howard stern, or no? \n\nbecause the south mixed with stern......= that comment \n\ni'm not saying it's right, i'm just saying that there are still people like that and inequalities in that sense does still exist for reasons such as that \n\ni think in a few generations it will be in textbooks though \n\ni mean, look at how one/two generations has changed views on Race AND Gender\n\nyeah, nothing this big and this imbedded in even our culture will change over night\n\nbut i do see a promising future \n\nfa sho fa sho \n\nwow, what an uplifting end \n\nbut look at the nations reaction to imus' comment \n\nit was an absolute outrage \n\nthat just tells you that so many people are willing to have and implement change, and even looking at the students accepting

        "The gay church?? \n\nyes please \n\nbecause that makes a huge difference in teh church's eyes \n\nwell in response to a.) i definitely think that priests should be allowed to marry\n\nyes and also that jesus wasn't married so neither should priests be \n\n(and not to get off topic but with all of teh da vinci code and similar stuff coming out, that is questionable)\n\nbut i think those are the only reasons \n\nyeah i know that i'm just saying that it has sparked a lot of research etc.\n\nok forget i brought that up \n\nbut i think that jesus and complete devotion are teh reasons for celibacy\n\nand personally i think that the priests could better connect/relate with a larger percentage of the parish if he was married\n\nand yes crash, that would help to bring the numbers back up \n\ni feel that it's getting to that point now \n\nthe church has evolved over the centuries to adapt (example, vatican II) so i don't see what the big deal is \n\nwell the current pope benedict is ultra conservative, so i don't see it happening under him \n\ni agree that consistency is good, but the times have changes so drastically from the hundreds and hundreds of years that teh church has been in existence so some change is necessary to maintain followers \n\ni agree rocks \n\nand in response to the celibacy of priests, that is a completely manmade law. way back when, they used to be able to marry, and then some people got together and decided against it\n\nexactly \n\nyeah and that doesn't really apply anymore \n\npriests of other denominations seem to be perfectly able to devote themselves to their families AND to their church \n\nso i don't see why catholic priests would be so inept in doing that \n\nyes, but there are certain regulations \n\nyou can't be a deacon and THEN get married \n\nif you are married first, you can become a deacon though\n\nno, sorry...i just know that my uncle wanted to become a deacon, but he was planning on getting married soon \n\nso he had to wait to become a deacon otherwise he wouldn't be able to get married \n\nand he hasn't become a deacon yet...i don't think he's going to anymore\n\nso if deacon's can be married, why can't priests??? \n\ni guess so \n\npretty much everything a priest can do during mass except for consecration \n\nbut i'm not positive \n\nexactly crash \n\ni'm not sure about divorce/annulment, but i know that if you are a widower, you CAN become a priest \n\nso you don't have to have never had sex \n\nthat's kind of asking a lot to require that all men entering the priesthood be virgins\n\nyeah but i would HOPE that someone who wanted to be a priest would not lie in order to take their vows \n\ni don't know \n\ni am against that \n\nyeah and it is an EXTREMELY difficult process to obtain an annulment \n\nyes you have to get all of these letter of witness from people who knew you during the marriage and they have to write about specific reasons why the marriage was not real in the first place \n\nand those people have to be catholic i believe and they have to get their priests to sign the letters \n\nand then the whole application has to be signed by a ton of different people in teh church hierarchy \n\nall the way up to the vatican \n\nit's a ridiculous process and it takes FOREVER \n\nso a lot of people choose not to go through it and just get a legal divorce\n\nso i don't think that they should be denied communiion \n\nyeah basically an annulment says that the marriage never existed int he first place...that for some reason or another one person entered into teh marriage under false pretenses i believe \n\nyes....if there was dishonesty right from the start, like the people wanted two different things \n\nso where were we going with this, not that we have a background of what an annulment is? \n\n*now \n\ni completely agree goldeneye \n\non a similar note, i read an article about how politicians who are pro-choice are also not supposed to recieve communion \n\ni agree, but to play the other side, how do you decide at which point this becomes too much? like when you disagree with too many points, are you no longer a catholic?? \n\nyes but i have heard some catholic say \"catholicism is not like a chinese menu, you can't pick and choose what to believe and what not to believe\" \n\nright and i think that from the official church position, as a catholic you are supposed to spread the ideas of teh catholic church, not just choose somethings to believe and disregard others \n\nnot i don't think that is it realistic, but from the official Church view, i wonder what they say? \n\nthe way i personally rationalize it (me being a catholic but NOT believeing in everything) is that many of the doctrines that i disagree with were created by man, not by God \n\nexactly\n\ni'm just asking whether OFFICIALLY....are you a catholic if you don't believe everything?? \n\nbut catholics have different views about the consecration and teh divinity of christ, etc \n\nthat are not connected to these manmade laws \n\nright rocks, i don't think it's fair though to ask people not to think for themselves and to just blindly believe everything becasue that's what their church believes\n\ngoldeneye?? \n\ncan you elaborate rocks? \n\nagreed rocks \n\ngoldeneye, i don't know...that's a very tough call. but personally i would like to think that i still have a religion even though i don't blindly follow everything i'm told. \n\ni would like to think so too......even just for the fact that if not, then where does that leave me? \n\nas i was trying to say before...i DON\"T pick and choose on the aspects of teh divinity of christ or more of the faith aspect...but i do disagree with some of the lifestyle \"rules\" \n\nwell me too then lol \n\nyeah, that's a lot to ask of anyone or thing \n\nhumans by our very nature are subject to making mistakes.....so an infallible instituation in the hands of anyone other than GOd is bound to be fallible \n\nwhich i believe was exactly what you said goldeneye \n\nso then taking that into account, do you still think that you have to believe EVERYTHING to call yourself a catholic, given the fallibility of the institution? \n\ni'm with rocks on this one \n\ni understand what you are saying goldeneye about not knowing much about a specific technical subject, but i'm with crash about knowing about your OWN life \n\nmoral decisions apply to other religions other than just catholicism \n\nso where is there room for personal choice in this goldeneye? \n\ni just kind of think that that's a short cut --- an excuse for not having to think for yourself \n\nwill you send us a reminder email before next time nicole?? \n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "i don't have any problems with it. \n\n? \n\nwell, my thing is this: a marriage license is something you apply for from the government. it's a completely secular process. i don't see any reason for them to change the wording, unless they're going to change it for everyone. churches are completely free to have a different definition for marriage if they want (most people have different definitions for things than the government anyway).\n\nhaha, sho nuff \n\nright, but that's a religious definition. when the government recognizes a person's marriage with a license, though, that's different \n\ni'm a catholic too, but my problem with not calling it a marriage is that the semantics involved seem to imply that it's a second-rate institution, which isn't fair \n\nthe words we use for something make a big difference in people's perceptions of a thing \n\ntrue too \n\ni think that when you argue that we should postpone giving them those same rights, even if only in a semantic sense, you're marginalizing them\n\neasing tensions is fine, but people argued that easing tensions was a good reason for postponing civil rights in the 60s, too\n\nwell, at the end of the day, the churches aren't the ones passing legislation, though \nwell, yes, that'd be fine; my problem would be with the government using two different terms, which encourages marginalization \n\nwell, \"churches\", plural \n\nyeah, that would be acceptable \n\ni think it's a stupid political contrivance to galvanize the republican base \n\ni think it's another karl rove-esque political move. the administration only cares about it as a point of leverage to garner support \n\ni would disagree with the statement that our gov't is based on religion, too \n\nmost of the founding fathers were deists, and if you read their personal writings closely they favored a secular veiw of a democratic republican system \n\nright, and amendments are generally reserved for serious constitutional changes, not legislative stunts \n\nyeah, i have a gay cousin and a few gay friends \n\nwell, most of them want to be able to get married in my experience, obviously \n\nyep\n\nfrom a legal and governmental perspective, i'd go for it \n\ni think that right now the issue isn't being given a fair shake as an issue in itself, though; it's being used as a social wedge. politicians are using it more as a tool to divide and conquer \n\nwell, look at the last presidential elections (gimme a minute) \n\nin a few midwestern states, local republican party members lobbied to have a gay marriage referendum on the ballot; in the states where that happened, that encouraged a larger portion of voters to turn out to vote against the referendum. that's what many really were encouraged to come to the polls by, and it just so happened that they also voted republican when it came to the candidates. that's an example of it being used as a political tool \n\nhahah, i think you're giving politicians too much credit when you say they don't change their minds. anybody follow hillary? \n\nProbably\n\nshe just gets made fun of a lot for flip-flopping \n\nyeah, pretty much as per her convenience \n\nyep\n\nyeah, and i think that that's a social change that's happening right now \n\n(people becoming more sensitive about it, i mean) \n\nwait, which part\n\ni don't really have any issues with it, to be honest. a lot of research seems to indicate that it's not a \"lifestyle choice\" so much as a genetic disposition.\n\nwell, no, but recent scientific research in animal groups indicates that it's a predisposition \n\nhttp://www.slate.com/id/2159262/ \n\n(that's an article about current gov't research involving gay sheep; they cause problems for farmers, since they don't breed, thus the research) \n\nright, but the general layout of their brains is basically the same as ours \n\nright, but we still have instinctual predispositions \n\nwhich dictate much of our conscious activity, like it or not \n\ni think that penguins in the LA zoo are kinda funny \n\nand yeah \n\nmy cousin's been taunted in public a couple times \n\nyeah, that's kinda par for the course, methinks \n\ni went to a catholic high school too, but most of the anti-gay sentiment came from testosterone, not religion \n\nstatistically, guys tend to react more negatively toward male same sex couples then girls do toward female same sex couples \n\nhaha, true dat \n\nyeah.....yeah\n\ni dunno, i know a lot girls who flipped for brokebakc mountain \n\n\n\n",

why? \n\naww - well i have to say that sucks, but it does depend on the church \n\nmy cousin is 19 and she got pregnant out of marriage last year, and her church was very supportive \n\nit's so different from area to area \n\nits awful \n\nyeah\n\nno, not at all, because the higher-ups probably wouldn't care at all\n\nit would just be going through the motions\n\ni think that somehow everyone over 50 would have to leave the church first before that happened \n\nthats true \n\nnonono, i meant all the cardinals and all \n\nhere\n\ni know some nice, very liberal old preists who want to change - but they are the serious minority \n\nat least from what i've seen \n\nthats what i think too \n\ni think the voting system would never work until there are people in power who will listen to the votes \n\nthats true \n\nahhhh! global issues!\n\ni actually completely forgot that there might be people elsewhere in the world who would fight to keep the church the way it is \n\nwow, there is SO much to think about in overhauling a massive oranization like the church \n\nhaha we could break off and form our own church like England did \n\nhaha ooooooh yeah i can\n\njust kidding about breaking off :) \n\ni think we need to see what the majority says first \n\nwe dont really know how other countries feel at all right now\n\nat least i dont \n\nwhat about africa? \n\nthere are still a large percentage of catholics in africa \n\neven if they die for it \n\ni believe it \n\nthe thing is, we're comfortable enough here that we can philosophize about ways to make it better \n\nin africa, so much is going on that they just accept what is \n\nwhat are we assuming?

        "in some cases it is \n\ni dont think so either \n\nbut we rarely consider gender bias against men \n\nyes\n\nand with the \"stay at home mom\" ideal \n\nwell it would be the same thing if i

think that since women are so caught up with being equal to men that if there were to be a draft women should be too \n\nbut i dont agree with that \n\ni mean, it should be up to them \n\nbut i definitely dont think all women are cut out to go to war \n\nyeah it depends on like \n\nhealth\n\nand other issues \n\nbut, i agree with frogger \n\nbut at the same time, whether its a sterotype or not, a lot of women have a family that they would need to take care of if their husbands were sent off to war\n\nyeah idk \n\ni think they should draft everyone, but it should be a womans choice\n\nif they have to draft \n\nmaybe, but i think a lot of women would go if they were called to rather than taking it upon themselves to enlist \n\nwell there are a lot of factors, women arent capable of the same things men are a lot of times, like the emotional factors of war \n\nyeah\n\nahah\n\ntheyre psychologically stronger in more emotional aspects, but that doesnt mean they would be ok with shooting someone \n\nthats why traditionally women are nurses and men are soldiers \n\nhaha, thanks \n\nyeah, and stereotypically men are more aggressive than women, theyre just more cut out for it\n\nwhich doesnt mean some women arent \n\nyeah true \n\ni dont know, i mean it is instinct to save yourself but im not sure women have the same instinct as men in that way \n\ni dont think we can say they do or they dont but i think if they did there would be a lot more women soldiers now \n\nahaha thats a stereotype \n\nbut thats kind of the problem \n\nwomen dont want that view of them \n\nyeah its true \n\nbut getting back to the main point, i dont know that they can be treated equally \n\ni mean women complain that they want to be equal to men, but every female in here and most you would ask would agree that they wouldnt want to be drafted \n\nyou cant have it both ways \n\nyeah\n\nahaha, exactly \n\nyeah i mean women have come a llong way \n\nprofessionally\n\nthere are just as many women CEOs as men these days \n\nwell the fact that there are any in fortune 500 is saying something, but even small companies \n\ni just think there is less of a \"glass ceiling\" now \n\nyeah\n\nyeah def \n\nwomen can be just as smart as men, which is the equality they were looking for for a long time \n\ni dont know what that means \n\nyeah because even if they did get drafted a lot less women than men would be qualified i would imagine \n\nlike with the push-up thing you just said \n\ni just think women will never be physically equal to men so whether theyre drafted or not doesnt nescessarily mean that theyre equal \n\nyeah definitely \n\nbut it doesnt matter how much ambition you have, a lot of women just cant do 50 pushups \n\nahaha\n\ni just think there are a lot of instances when women cant do the same things men can, and also a lot of them where men cant do what women can \n\nyeah \n\ni think it should be their choice, no one is stopping women from being in the army, but that doesnt mean it should be drafted. its the same for men, no one is stopping men from being stay at home dads, but that doesnt mean all of them are cut out for it \n\nthen weve come a long way \n\nyeah, i think equality should be based on ability \n\nmen and women are different, theres no way to change that\n\nno, def not \n\nif a man and a woman are both cut out for a job, thats where equality should come in \n\nyeah me either \n\nwell women are stereotyped in sitcoms but so are men \n\nyeah\n\nand full house \n\nhes a stay at home dad \n\nwell, hes a full time dad \n\nyeah and there are plenty of sitcoms that protray men as sloppy beer drinking sport fans \n\nbut that doesnt play a role in their applying for work\n\nso it shouldnt for women either \n\nyeah that makes sense \n\neven shows like sex and the city, where women are independently successful\n\nyeah so i dont think sitcoms really affect anything \n\nyeah \n\ni think they change with society \n\nwhich is important \n\nyeah, def \n\nahah \n\ni was just going to say that \n\nimus\n\ndon imus or soemthing \n\nyeah and thats not really the same kind of show as like full house or

        "the... gay.. church? \n\nCan we get a clarification on the story? \n\nDivorced means just divorced or couples who receive an anulment? (whatever the word is for the church allowing someone to marry again) \n\nOh\n\nOkay, well I agree that divorce is way too wide spread these days. Marriage is getting trivialized and basically means nothing. \n\nThe reason is that they are supposed to devote their lives completely and utterly to God. \n\n(And not to someone of the opposite sex) \n\nThe Da Vinci Code is hardly a reputable source, though. \n\nHasn't the Church proven its falsity?\n\nNo no no, I'm not sure. \n\nI just figured since they made it into a Tom Hanks movie, it must not be too reputable. lol \n\nCouldn't the act of love also strengthen their ties to God? If you are a priest, you believe that God granted you that sacred act. \n\nWell, the only way to have an institution last for so long on a global scale is to keep it constant. \n\nwhat are you referring to, specifically? Vatican II? \n\nRight, but you have to be careful what you change. In Vatican II, they made changes to the mass ceremony that made it much more available to people attending. But changing celibacy and allowing female priests would change foundations that have been there for thousands of years.\n\nOkay, that just seems silly\n\nDo you know the reason for that? \n\nMore devotion is required for a priest. \n\nWhat do deacons do anyway? \n\nThat means they were never really married in the Church's eyes. \n\nOtherwise, the people eligible for priesthood would be really slim. \n\nSo what about allowing priestesses?\n\nWhat if there was no shortage? \n\nSo what about not allowing divorced couples to receive communion? \n\nMarriage is the most sacred of bonds, though. \n\nI suppose it depends on how difficult the process of annulment is. Ideally, an annulment would take care of all those marriages in which it was not the fault of those getting married. In that case, I am fine with not allowing divorced people to receive communion. Marriage should be a LIFE decision. \n\nYeah, that seems reasonable to me. Kind of a dissapointing conclusion, though.\n\nSuch as if one person did not want to have children and one did. \n\nSince the annulment process is out of control, legally divorced couples should be allowed to receive Communion anyways. \n\n(I believe that is our conclusion) \n\nHey hey hey, maybe some kind of process to allow them back into the Church community? \n\nA Penance? \n\nInteresting point.\n\nHmm... well I do not agree with abortion. I think it is different then the gay marriage question., \n\nclockwatcher, you made a good point. To be a Catholic means to share the views of the Church, no? \n\nOtherwise, what does it mean\n\n? \n\nExactly\n\nWell if you believe in the church then you believe that it is directly connected to Jesus Christ\n\nTherefore, shouldn't you agree with everything they declare to be Church doctrine? \n\nThen, to me, it is pointless to be a Catholic. \n\nI don't think so. \n\nYes, clock, but the Church has an official stance on everything. In the real world, it makes sense that most people would disagree with some aspect of the Church. But where do we draw the line between picking and choosing values? What makes you Catholic then? \n\ngoldeneye, i don't know...that's a very tough call. but personally i would like to think that i still have a religion even though i don't blindly follow everything i'm told. \n\nIt's not that you SHOULD follow blindly, its just a interesting question whether you are truly a Catholic if you don't\n\nTo me, being Catholic is being a good person and embracing the core values of the Church (i.e. Ten Commandments). I really don't think Good will shut out the gates of Heaven to a good person who got divorced. \n\nGod*\n\nRight, that makes sense\n\nlol Crash \n\nThe problem is that an infallible institution is run by fallible individuals. But hey, we can't have it any other way. \n\nThe Catholic Church is an institution that should not have any errors. \n\nAt all. \n\nI know, I'm saying thats the problem. \n\nIt can NEVER be infallible\n\nBut it's supposed to be... \n\nAnother one of these unsolvable problems. \n\nI still think you do. Heres my reasoning: \n\nIn high school, I was taught that everyone is NOT entited to their own opinion on ANY subject. For instance, I would not make a claim about a gay gene to a geneticist or something\nTherefore, aren't the Church (Vatican, Pope, Cardinals, etc.) the most qualified to form interpreted opinions about Church doctrine\n\nWell, in being a Catholic, you are basing your life decisions on what God would want, right? \n\nYou wouldn't. But the people who are in the best position to interpret God's will all live in the Vatican\n\nThats seems okay \n\nBoth very good questions. lol \n\nTo answer those questions\n\nAnd with experts being wrong, it definitely occurs, but they are still the logical choice to trust. \n\n\n\n",

We were trying to give democracy to a nation that previously had not experienced it, but that goal seems to have long since parished\n\nMy other thought dealing with the length is the drain it has had on the domestic economy and overall morale\n\nWell with that hindisight Bush should correct his actions and not send more troops \n\nIn all fairness, we all make mistakes...their's are far more visible \n\nI just believe they should be able to spot their mistake and correct it now\n\nnot make it worse \n\nExactly, it does not seem, domestically anyway, that there is still a strong drive for democracy \n\nTo some extent I agree with that, but the US should be a force that other countries can come to for aide \n\nSilently, the people of Iraq \n\nthey were clearly sufferring under their current rule \n\nTrue, and we cannot help everyone on the planet at once\n\nYou do not have to pick, do what you can with your limited resources\nNot every person in the world is sufferring because their government is a tyrrany, but rather because it is underdeveloped \n\nWe would not invade an underdeveloped country because it is underdeveloped\n\nso then why invade every country where people are sufferring, that's an irrational generalization \n\nBy the very nature of us being enclosed on planet Earth, we will never have an infinite amount of resources \n\nCertainly\n\nThere's a difference between learning from your previous mistakes and failiing to take future actions. We cannot let past failures with good intent stop us from trying for future good intentions merely because we failed...think about it, if you failed a test in a class, would you just say you learned from failing that and not take the next one - no, you would try harder and strive for that same intention \n\nEven if in hindsight it turned out their were no weapons...is that a risk we could take, to assume there were no weapons even if we had the smallest of inclinations that they did \n\nWe have taken action against North Korea in a political manner as opposed to war \n\nMaybe some sort of physical threat is yet to come \n\nYou seem to forget the years before the war, both Bushes and Clinton....there have been political actions\n\nIt would be, agreed. It would encompass many uninterested and unmotivated fighters \n\nI do not feel that \n\nReasons to fight can differ from person to person \n\nI know there is no way I would be motivated to fight in a draft - there are too many other thing important to me to do that with my life.\n\nAgreed\n\nSorry about that \n\nAll terrorist groups \n\nit's a fight against terrorism \n\nThe ideal thereof \n\nI think you may be mixing separate fights \n\nThe independence of Iraq and then terrorist groups \n\ntrue enough, but terrorism can exist beyond the boundaries of Iraq as well \n\nI happen to have CNN as my homepage, and maybe once a month I see on the front page that they have caught some new member of Al Queda \n\nOr killed \n\nNot directly, it would seem \n\nReally\n\nThere is only one leader in the organization \n\nSo if at Loyola all the teachers left, but the President was still here, just as effective? \n\nObviously\n\nAre cries for the fight have been worldwide\n\nYou and I both know the difference between a teacher and an effecitve teacher \n\nYes\n\nand that battle lives on \n\nThere are still insurgeons fighting against the cause in Iraq - supporters of Hussein \n\nThe hierarchy has students, teachers, and the president - without good teachers, the new students will suffer, or perhaps there will be a diminishing return on new students because of a lack of teachers \n\nThey are not free \n\nthat is incorrect, there is still very much danger over in the territory \n\nWhere do you get that idea?\n\nDid you not see the Iraqis all over the world celebrating the day they got their freedom rom tyrannical rule \nYou see victory in a very clear cut way - for instance crossing a finish line in a marathon, but what if that marathon is to raise money for aids, was there not some small victory in the race itself, the attempt thereof \n\nDo no misconstrue my point, I believe the war should be ended.

        "definitely not, it's a public site \n\nokay yeah that's true, but at the same time you shouldn't put things up that you don't want to get in trouble for later \n\nwell they can be \n\nif parents are concerned about their kids drinking or doing drugs it definitely is\n\nif you don't want your parents to know your business don't post i up where anywhere can see it \n\nwell if you're holding a beer can \n\nthen why take a picture with it? \n\nokay so if someonw posts on your wall \"yeah dude last weekend was so great we got sooo wasted\" \n\nand your parents see that \n\nwell i'm sure you'll have a really good defense whe you're confronted about it\n\nwell i don't think a school should be able to punish studnets for drugs or alcohol if it didn't happen on the school's campus \n\nhey thanks \n\nwhat i don't understand though is why you would post up your plans to shoot up a school where everyone can see it \n\nwell if that's the case, then that's one thing, but if you really intended on carrying it out, that's just crazy \n\nwell i have a situation that actually happened to my family that's kind of related to the phone thing and i definitely agree that its an invasion of privacy\n\nsorry about ath \n\nwhat about e-mail? \n\nso are phone conversations \n\na different story how? \n\nwell before myspace, kids formed actual hate groups like on the playground so it's not really any different to put it on the internet, and kids are punished anyways for being mean to other students so i don't think it should be handled any differently \n\nhappened to her you mean? \n\ni mean it's cruel, but that's how kids are \n\nthey choose someone different to hate every week \n\nwell the problem is nothing has happened at school yet \n\ni mean the students have done anything to her on school grounds\n\ni don't either \n\n\ni agree i don't think the parents should be notified \n\ni know in my high school they blocked facebook and myspace because students would check them when they should be doing work, it seems like the best way to do things in order to avoid these situations \n\nyeah i'm pretty sure every high school keeps track of what sites students visit \n\nyeah i don't understand why you'd get on AIM during school anyways, aren't all your friends basically sitting next to you in class? \n\nwell if the school can monitor that you've been on facebook or whatever site, they can monitor that too, and you can still get into trouble \n\nwell not so much at my school, kinds kind of just went there to get out of class or study hall and hang out with their friends \n\nhence, why they'd get on aim and such \n\nyeah but i went to a public school with roughly 2000 students and they were too busy worring abour people \"thrusting\" at dances and stuff \n\nno they should, but ultimately it's up to the student \n\nyes\n\nand the attendence police won't be an issue \n\nand that could be taking away from a student who actually needs to do work \n\nwell i think that schools have a responsibilty to make sure you are safe during your free period, and that involves having some rules \ni know in my high school you weren't allowed to leave campus unles syou were a senior and had a certain gpa during free periods \n\noh obviously not kids left all the time to go do drugs or whatever the hell else they wanted to do \n\nwell you said not everyone would follow the rules and i was just giving an example, no issue \n\nagreed, schools should provide safe environments but they should also know their bounds \n\n\n\n",
        "Yup\n\nOpening thought - allowed, but under state not church\n\nTo some extent, even under church - we can get to that though.\n\nAgreed, but I hear recently the Episcopal church is making a turn \n\nwhich is splitting apart their organization \n\nHalf and half \n\nThe International Episcopal church has one leader in the NorthEast who has proclaimed he is gay\n\nand some congregations have agreed to follow him while others - especially internationally- have threatened to split off \n\nReally interesting though, to see atleast some other congregations following him \n\nTrue, but it hits the gay topic within the Church \n\nShoot\n\nIdeally, I wish it would be allowed internationally, but to truly work, I think state by state or country by country, the decision shoudl be made\n\nWhat I do no understand is how gay people can be condemned to hell, yet made in the image and likeness of this good God \n\nNo true \n\nNot \n\nJesus says the only sin unforgiveable is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit \n\nOthers are foregiven with the chance for salvation \n\nOk, so why can't you ask for foregiveness then \n\nIn a legal sense, it should be allowed \n\nTHen I do not understand your previous point\n\nHow they are condemned to Hell\n\nIt's not blasphemy against the Holy Spirit \n\nExactly \n\nand I believe the Church supports that \n\nas long as their is some motive not to act upon it \n\nRight, outside the church, it should be completely legal - to act on and everything \n\nA traditional society is still catching up \n\nSame reason slavery was not abolished over night \n\nDisagree\n\nI am no scientist, but hear it is part of the genetical code \n\nPrecisely\nThis all leads me back to my question about why the church could condemn it - if we are all \"made in the image and likeness of a good God\", how can these people be sinning. Perhaps we are really sinning for not accepting them in the Church. \n\nThanks, any insight? \n\nI am truly clueless on that point \n\nDefinitely, with the same moral tradition, but allow this open sexuality\n\nYes, especially if evidence is true that it is a piece of our genetic make-up\n\nit would be like therapy for read hair as mntbike would say \n\nCan you explain that \n\nI can agree with that \n\nYes \n\nNo sir \n\nYea, friends, though \n\nI can see that how you were brought up can make you think it's right or wrong, but as you grow older you should wrestle with the idea in a more intellectual manner \n\nMuch, again, like the idea of slavery \n\nI do not see any problem with it\nThe rich part of life is diversity, who says we should all have a \"perfect\" mother/father bringing up \n\nHow so? \n\nIn that sense maybe yes, but who says that is the ultimate way to be raised. You can have the same loving collaboration from same sex parents\n\nI think so \n\nI read an interesting article the other day that too many people go in to marriage expecting to always feel the same feelings they had at the beginning for the rest of their marriage. That is seems to set the marriage to doom as feelings are a fleeting thing. Perhaps if more people cherished the actual bond and search for ideals beyond feelings the rate would come down\n\nI think it's that ^ \n\nMe?\n\nthere is an initial feeling which we call love, people expect that to last throughout marriage even though feelings are a fleeting experience. We have to find something beyond that feeling of \"love\". Love seems to be ill-defined\n\nThere are certainly feelings associated with it \n\nbut how can you base a life-long relationship on feelings\n\nFeelings are not lasting \n\nTrue\nRidiculous\n\nA government is supposed to support the interests of its people, not stand in the way \n\nIt's not like the citizens are asking to carry around bazookas\n\nWhich should be separated from the State \n\nAll true \n\nAll true \n\nnot logical ones \n\nNot to say they can't be one in the same at times\n\nTrue, and instead of putting the work into correcting those issues, the government wants an amendment to simplify things \n\nThey would not have to deal with the legal issues discussed by Klutzo, because a ban would be in place \n\nI am not entirely sure, but I would say many are much further behind us \n\nTrue\n\nbut when you get to some of the far eastern cultures with deeper traditions, it seems like it would be further behind us \n\nYes \n\nI think all of our points up until now support that: there is a separation a state and church, genetic makeup, etc...\n\nGovernment is to support the interests of the people, not crush them \n\nSo were some against slavery \n\nhopefully moral righteousness wins out \n\nAbsolutely\n\nPart of it, as has be discussed, is a mixing of Church beliefs and State \n\nMy final thought is that gay marriage should eventually be legalized internationally, but to get there we need a state-by-state or country-by-country drive to legalize it. It is part of our natural genetic make up and should not rely on the interests of any religion \n\nBut a law is a step in the right direction, atleast they will have their rights \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "I think that there are certain things that could be changed, but at the same time I think it's important to have something that remains relatively steadfast in this fast-paced world of the 21st century \n\nwhat groups of people were you talking about mtnbike?/ \n\nhow are they not accepting of non-catholics? \n\ndo they shun them? \n\nor discriminate against them? \n\nMuslims say that you have to pray 5 times a day and make a pilgrimmage to Mecca etc. in order to be saved \n\ndo you have a problem with them as well? \n\nor for that matter, all institutionalized religions? \n\nwho says there is a heaven? \n\nexcuse me, knows\n\nbesides, if someone tells you that you're not going to heaven, and they don't have any direct power over you, why would you care? \n\nexactly, so what's your problem with the Catholic Church then? \n\ngo for it \n\nActually, doctors of the Church like Thomas Aquinas claim that we can't know anything about God, God is a mystery \nInteresting\n\nit seems to me like mtnbike has a problem with the Catholic Church in all centuries \n\nnot just the 21st, please correct me if I'm wrong \n\nwell then, if we may agree to disgree about the validity of institutionalized religions, and just accept their existence, perhaps we can return to the issue at hand, which is, what about the Catholic Church conflicts with the 21st century, and should the Church change its ways to conform\n\nso fasting is at odds with the 21st century\n\nI agree \n\nI think that there are members of the Church who do accept gay people\n\ni agree \n\nI also feel that women should be allowed to participate in the hierarchal administration of the Church \n\nI mean, especially with the shortage of priests that exists in this country, I think that women should have the opportunity to become priests \n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nthat's a good question, I don't know the answer \nah, so you feel that they couldn't adequately peform their duties if they had to take care of a family as well? \n\nnot everyone has a family \n\ni mean, spouse and children \n\nyou see, the docrine of requiring priests to remain celibate was a product of the 12th century \n\nbefore then, priests were usually married \n\nbut in the 12th century, the Catholic Church became very powerful and gained a lot of land \n\nmarried priests who died left children whose right it was to have the land \n\nbut the Catholic Church wanted to hold on to that land \n\nhence, they decided to ban priests from marrying \n\nseeing as this ban is a product of the greedy, corrupt 12th century Catholic Church \n\nI wonder if its all that necessary in the 21st century \n\nI mean, people also used the argument you mentioned before Janada, even back then, but money and land were the main factors in the decision\n\nIf I may add, the Catholic Church has allowed certain men, who were formally reverends in a Protestant faith with a wife and children, to convert to the Catholic faith and become priests\nso, perhaps this is a sign of change to come \n\ni'm not sure why \n\ni can't explain it, but my dad knows one of these priests \n\ni just thought that I'd throw it out there \n\nhow do you mean? \n\nwell, neither do I \n\nit's just a horrible tragedy \n\nunfortunately, one that seems like it could've been somewhat prevented\n\nit seems that certain priests and bishops knew about it for some time before it was exposed \n\nwhich is why think that the nature of the Church administration needs to change - include women \n\nindeed, child molestation is very much a part of the 21st century \n\nto uh, concur with Janada's earlier statement \n\nThey would say that the love of God, or grace or whatever cannot be tainted by imperfect humans \n\nI guess my other question would be, besides the fasting that Rocketship mentioned earlier and the attitude toward homosexuality, are there any other beliefs that you think the Catholic Church should change in order to conform to life in the 21st century \n\nI don't exactly thik that there's a lack of people who oppose the Catholic Church \n\nor for that matter, institutionalized religion in general \n\nthink*, exuse me \n\nwell, then, I guess wel \n\nsorry,\n\ni guess we'll just have to agree to disagree, is what i meant to say \n\nso, Rocket Ship, belief should be based on reason? \n\nyes some root, but entirely? \n\nbecause many doctors of the Catholic Church do make arguments in support of faith by using reason \n\nright, is it so wrong for people to have faith? \n\nor is that just taboo in the 21st century? \n\nah, so now we are speaking of the Catholic Church in terms of the lay people, am I right? \n\nyes, those who don't belong to the holy orders\n\nlike, the priesthood, or nuns \n\nI think that there's so many dissenting views of Catholics within the Catholic Church that no general statement can be made about them \n\nIf I may add something about the positive role the Church plays in the 21st century, it is the source of some of the greatest amounts of service performed \n\nIf I may add something about the positive role the Church plays in the 21st century, it is the source of some of the greatest amounts of service performed \n\nindeed i hope it doesn't \n\nand I think that the Church's humanitarian role extends even further, to the defense of life, and I think that their stance on issueds like abortion and the death penality and war are important to our society in the 21st century as well \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If an employer tries extra hard not to discriminate against gender, he or she could be hiring employees that are not qualified for that position. \n\nMen and women in the same jobs? \n\nI can't see how that would happen in a modern world like ours.

a good system of government... but now its gone, we have inherited some serious problems that beg the question whether or not intervention was justified \n\nyes we have blue, the removal of saddam and the emergence of deep seated conflict which we failed to wholly forsee \n\nby the sword it was stable \n\nand those who didnt agree were pretty much any non-sunnis \n\nyou are right, it was group A

of saddam \n\nand they like us because we are TRYING to rebuild their lives, but TONS of them don't have electricity yet, they still have to pass through pain in the ass checkpoints, and dont like us for that \n\nwould guess most of their aggression is aimed toward each other rather than us, there are just groups who dislike/attack us \n\nat this point our best realistic goal is to find the BEST course of action which is realistically possible which will lead to the least amt. of suffering for us AND them \n\nif i could do ANYTHING i would learn arabic, get a lot tanner, go to iraq, and make friends and just talk to them and see whats up \nthere is a way to compromise \n\nbut as newcomers to the region, how do we unravel 800+ years of bad blood adn find it \n\nbut we arent tearing their homes apart\n\ntheir internal conflicts are tearing each others homes apart, and we have secondary/tertiary roles in them \n\nan iraqi whose family was killed in the gas attacks will love us for hanging saddam\n\nerrr not hanging but removing and bringing to quasijustice\n\nbut one who has to commute to baghdad for work every day and wait in a 3+hour checkpoint line will be frustrated \n\nand MANY MORE, whose families have been killed by other iraqis, will just get pissed and feed into their downward spiral of a civil war\n\nthats where the hate will come in \n\ni think at this point we have the BEST intentions in iraq (set up a govt, economic infrastructure, etc) but they just might not be entirely feasible considering the fact that we are BROKE AS SHIT \n\nnobody

about americans \n\nand his predicitons were pretty eerily dead on \n\nbut that made us temporarily care \n\nthat made us care enough to go into afghanistan \n\nand some people definitely MANIPULATED our 9/11 feelings to make us go into iraq too even tho the two were unrelated \n\nbut do you know why we didnt find osama \n\nbecause when we went into afghanistan we had no reliable human assets, so we paid a bunch of warlords to secure the borer on the side of the country which we weren't invading from, they then took our money and let saddam sneak out the other side \n\nerr osama \n\nnot saddam \n\nand now hes gone \n\nAND hes a BUILDER for christ sakes \n\nbut he has, with all his WELL BUILT foxholes and shit \n\nwhich we will never be able to totally flush out because its a logistical nightmare \n\ni dont know and i dont care \n\nbecause even if he is he cant really do much now \n\nbecause OSAMA is inconsequential, as soon as we get him, someone else will take his place \n\nwe need to be trying to resolve the CONFLICT, not just resolving the MAN\n\ndid killing saddam pacify iraq? \n\nwill killing osama pacify the world? \n\nXacto\n\nhaha i thought we were talking a half hour on each topic \n\noh word \n\nyes we did \n\nwe didnt go into iraq for osama \n\nBUT if it werent for 9/11 it would have been a hell of a lot harder to sell the american polis/congress on invading iraq \n\npeople were still scared about being attacked, and the WMD thing played into post 9/11 fears seamlessly \n\nsaddam would still be a egomaniacal fruitcake in power there\n\nif we didnt go in there \n\nhe wouldnt really be doing a whole lot \n\nhed be talking a lot of shit \n\nand maybe trying to score som uranium from ahmadinejad \n\nbut mahmoud would be like i aint touchin you homie \n\nlook at it this way: we are now broke, bankrupt, we owe our SOULS in T-bills to china, and we are still sending reckless threats to iran \n\nsaddam was so delusional that he SERIOUSLY didnt think we were gonna make it into baghdad \n\nhe buried his jets in the sand for christ sakes cuz he thought he was gonna have to suppress a rebellion in the south after he WON the war \n\nthats quite a generalization, its a big bag of something but i dont know if its a big bag of i hate america \n\nits a big bag of \"hey we can play this game too, so give us legitimacy and stop treating us in a condescending manner you behemoth of an america\"\n\nif bush wasnt too freaking proud to sit down at a table with mahmoud ahmadinejad (iranian prez) we might get somewhere \npull out of iraq? \n\ni dont think i am sufficiently informed to suggest a pullout strategy \n\nand after reading papers/watching TV, its possible that none of us are, no offense guys, everyone in this room

if they ACTUALLY lived out their religious beliefs in a political way, theyd be protesting the iraq war right now \n\npolitically brilliant isn tit\n\nhaha\n\nand another thing \n\nhow can someone be anti-abortion yet pro-death penalty and pro-iraq at the same tim \n\nit seems to be logically contradictory to me, explain \n\nbut babies are full of original sin right \n\nill shut up now

        "i agree with that...i have nothing to hide and don't really care if they scan my calls\n\nso in essence we're really talking about the patriot act here?\n\ni think that's in the provisions of the patriot act....that this information will only be used for the purposes of preventing terrorism \n\nbut it seems here that everyone is for it \n\ninteresting\n\nthat also brings up an interesting issue though: you can't necessarily PROVE just from a picture that you were drinking underage. for example (and yes i know that this is unlikely) but you could just be holding a cup and not actually drinking it.\n\nyes that's true \n\nso if you set all of your settings on facebook so that only your friends can view your profile, how would the school be able to look at your pictures anyway? unless they access it from one of your friends \n\nbut is that right? \n\nbut for the NSA thing, we're trying to prevent terrorism, not underage drinking. i think the caliber of those crimes are completely different \n\nagain i have a quesiton about how they are accessing your facebook profile if your settings are completely private \n\nyeah that's my question...i know that the internet is public, but if you speficially set up your account to be private, is that still public anyway?\n\n*specifically \n\nso then if someone somehow hacks into your supposedly private profile, i DO think that that is an invasion of privacy\n\ngood point goldeneye \n\nso then i guess in response to the facebook thing, if you DON't set your facebook to private, and then there are pictures of you publically posted, you run the risk of possibly being incriminated. but if you DO set it to private, then those pictures can't be used against you?? because the info would have been obtained illegally?? \n\n*publicly \n\nRight\n\nyeah like we agree that the facebook and the terrorism situations are on completely different levels, but if we take a situation somewhere in between, when do we cross over from it being not acceptable to being acceptable?\n\ni agree with the fact that it is the events surrounding 9/11 that have made it acceptable \n\nand in regards to a single life....i think that a life is worth more than privacy\n\nbut that's my personal opinion \n\njust to make things more difficult, i'll bring up this point: while we as college students don't likely have much to hide on the level of terrorism and are thus out privacy rights are not really affected by the patriot act, what do you think of the fact that this sort of an act will target certain groups (like arabs)? \n\nbut did they find the letter by actively searching the locker or was it just lying around? \n\nyeah we had locker inspections at my school too \n\nok yeah thanks nicole....i was wondering what made it ok in that situation \n\nbut on the other hand, since it IS school property, you should know not to store anything in there that would somehow get you in trouble if the lockers WERE searched \n\nand if you do decide to do it anyway, then you should be aware that you are taking that risk \n\nyes but those personal things likely won't be incriminating\n\nok that makes sense \n\ni don't know...that's a good question though \n\n\n",

things that they shouldnt be allowed to prosecute you on \n\nloyola is a private institution, not a government \n\nits a network that allows people from many schools to join\n\nts not run or funded by loyola \n\ni understand that \n\nits more of an issue with me of where they SHOULD draw the line\n\ni understand their power \n\nwhat they are and arent allowed to do \n\ni guess when it all comes down to the wire im more or less arguing for a change in our society \n\nim just being an idealist here and a devils advocate \n\ni think instead of using facebook to bust us, they should use it to protect us \n\nschool shootings, things of that nature \n\nbecause some idiots post that shit up there \n\nits happened with myspace and other public websites \n\nwell we dont just have to talk about facebook \n\nafterall, this is a very open subject \n\nand we dont just have to focus on loyola and FB \n\ndepending on what they are and their relativity\n\nif you write up a hitlist and post it on a website, sure you should be taken in \n\nso wait, was the book published and then it happened? \n\nit could have just been some random guy who read it \n\nthey would probably investigate \n\nthats a matter of separating fact from fiction \n\nif you put some kind of disclaimer nothing can happen \n\nwell that wouldnt be the disclaimer \n\nthat would just make it seem more suspicious \n\nbut if he told the readers that all of the storys were based on fictional events\n\ntheres a fine line between an interesting read and being a crazed serial killer \n\ni would say no \n\nthere are tons of storys out there about murder \nthey would ask him if he knew anything about it \n\nim sure \n\nHEY\n\nnow if some guy wrote up a list and said \"people who need to die\" as the title, there might be a problem \n\nthats when its up to the judge to decide \n\ni could make a post saying \"i hate matt damon\" or something \n\nsure it can be interpreted as \"i want to kill him\" but then again...\n\nthats where people have to draw the line \n\nnot really \n\nits kinda sad \n\nor does he\n\nunless you put them there yourself \n\nwhich doesnt seem like anybody would do that \n\ni think both are equally important \n\nwhile its nice to be able to be alone and do things that nobody else can know about... its also nice to not get shot everywhere \n\nprivacy and security work in opposite ways \n\nif theres too much privacy people want more security \n\nas always \n\nprivate, but then again, to an extent \n\ndid you know that every single email that you have ever sent in your life is saved somewhere on the internet? \n\nevery website has your IP tracked \n\neach individual website is like a little privately owned facility \n\nall on loyola's server \n\noh that one \n\nwe all did \n\ni beleive \n\nbut even in a public room we are able to maintain our privacy\n\ni most definatly wouldnt \n\nit is on loyola's server \n\nand loyola's campus \n\nnone of us know who any other one of us is \n\ntherefore our privacy is maintained there \n\nwell yeah \n\nif?\n\nbut i wouldnt do that because im respectful \n\nbut still, we signed saying they could do that gobig \n\nthey can \n\nsince its public wires \n\nbut \n\nits one step closer to totalitarianism \n\nto hold us down \n\nespecially when it comes to iraq \n\nnot trying to bring that up \n\nhaha\n\nbut think about it \n\nwiretapping shortly after a major event like 911 \n\nto root out the terrorists in the country \n\nfear as a tactic \ninvading more privacy to produce fear \n\nYOUR NEIGHBOR COULD BE A TERRORIST \n\nWE MUST LISTEN TO YOUR PHONESEX HOTLINE TO FIND OUT\n\nthats one area where i think they should avoid \n\nyeah, but its an example of someones privacy vs the government \n\ni think the real issue will arise when they stop listening and start taking action against people that they're not searching for \n\nthey should have to have some kind of guidelines for what they can arrest you for when they tap \n\nif they say that its to root out the terrorists and then arrest you for trying to buy some weed, thats kinda not cool \n\nbut they could \n\nhey havent but theyve induced this fear in everybody that they're listening in\n\nnow everybody is on edge \n\nwell, not everybody \n\nwell, not everybody \n\nbut they should \n\nbig brother is watching \nill agree \n\nhahaha \n\nlol oops \n\nhahaha bad idea\n\nyou can talk to yourself for that long \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "well as far as the seperation of church and state issue, i think the state's definition of marriage should be made without any church's (catholic or otherwise) input\n\nso even if a catholic (like me) sees the *sacrament* of marriage as a man and woman, i dont see why other people cant have a ceremony and call it the same thing \n\ni dont think the country is that stupid where we can't differentiate the tow \n\n?\n\nWhy\n\nYea\n\nwell thats not very intelligent \n\ni mean, one of the main talking points is society with this issue is the catholics anal retentive way of saying \"the bible defines marriage as...\" where other religions just don't give a %^&* \n\ncouldn't tell you \n\ni dont know \n\naforementioned catholics being the \"bad\" ones \n\ni would guess, yea \n\nthere do exist christian sects that allow gay marriages \n\nnot sure, it came up in the group discussions \n\none person was from a religion where it was acceptable \n\nchristian religion \n\ni thought so \n\nalthough some fundamentalist christians and catholics aren't exactly on the same page\n\nlol\n\n ...because of the seperation of church and state? \n\ni dunno \n\nhaha\n\nwell i think we're all agreed on the ridiculous-ness of the argument \n\nhm\n\nwell i just think it's interesting \n\nif one family can't give it to them, why not let another \n\ncause if you think about it, adoption is the main way a gay couple would get children \n\nwhat about man/man? \n\nsurrogate mother \n\nthats just creepy \n\nlol\n\nthats not even a gay issue \n\nsurrogate mothers freak me out \n\ni know, thats why i said it wasn't even a gay issue \n\nstraight mothers use sperm banks too \n\nsoo \n\nwhats up \n\nwell the genetic thing is interesting, but the \"frogs are gay\" argument is stupid\n\nhomosexuality in animals does exist, but some animals also eat their own shit\n\nhumans are on a different plane \n\nhaha, exactly \n\ngood point xyz \n\nyea nicole, are we good? any other talking points \n\nwell just cause its biological doesnt mean anything \n\na lot of them already accept that, and say it's a 'disease' \n\nlike colorblindness \n\nwell their argument is\n\ngod has given you a difficult cross to bear, so if you aren't attracted to the opposite sex than you are destined for a life of chastity \n\nor to go into the priesthood \n\nwhich, as we know, has yielded some awful circumstances \n\nwait whats up? \n\ncan you clarify that \n\nwell why are some people born with birth defects? \n\nthats what they think \n\nits some kind of birth defect \n\nbut it does say you have to get married to a member of the other sex \n\ni agree its unfair, but im just trying to defend them for the sake of the discussion \n\nthat i agree \n\nvery good point \n\nyea, ive run out of defensive manuveurs for them lol \n\nnicole?\n\nk \n\n",
        "both are wrong \n\nits not up to the state in the first place \n\ni agree with civil unions, but i think that should be require no matter what kind of couple you are, homosexual or heterosexual \n\nmarriage is a sacrament \n\nit is performed in the church that you are a member of and should be a part of that \n\nonce married in whichever church you should be allowed to apply for a civil union which will grant you the benefits \n\nit wouldnt change anything with the current state of marriage, you could still use husband or wife or whatever, but there would be a little more paperwork\n\nno you dont, but still thats a whole different thing\n\n marriage is a term used in church \n\nthats a much more logical name \n\nfor a non-religious wedding \n\nor so to speak \n\ni dont know, i tend to associate \"married\" with religion \n\nbecause ive always been taught it was a sacrement \n\nim not religious anymore, but being raised that way and all... \n\nthe title marriage though is closely associated with the church \n\nim not saying they shouldnt be able to say they are, im saying the state shouldnt \n\nthe state is not a church \n\nthe state cannot perform sacraments \n\nits too close to a religious title \n\nthats like calling a representative a priest or something \n\ni feel that it is \n\nokay this is too off topic at the moment \n\nwere discussing the title of marriage as opposed to gay marriage \n\nthat is the more liberal definition of it yes \n\ni agree \n\ni never said they shouldnt be allowed to \n\ni just feel that decision is up to the church, for the religious unions \n\nto getting married in a church? \n\nyes it is an alternative \n\nif the church doesnt allow it there isnt much other choice \nokay, you win now get on topic instead of consistantly arguing your point which i will refuse to agree with \n\nwell... husband/husband \n\ni do think that they should get all the same things that they would in a church, but as for the churches it is up to them to allow it or not\nalright \n\nthen we both agree \n\nbut the way that our government has tried to enforce bans has been affecting the church \n\nand if they banned it altogether it would impact the churches right of free exersise \n\nif you ban gay marriage then you wouldnt be allowed to get married inside of a church either \n\nexactly, but i dont feel that its up to the government to make that one decision for them \n\ni can understand somnething that would be determental such as a church that practices killing people \n\nmaybe for your case \n\nbut in many cases people do get married in a church \n\nhow about those \"lent friendly menus\"\n\nive never had off for jewish holidays \n\nhence the push for the amendment banning gay marriage because of his catholic beliefs \n\nwin\n\nhigh five \n\nin the front \n\nto the side \n\nbig brother \n\nsweet, chinese food! \n\nthats weird \n\nyoud expect Utah to like them, usually its the dems who are after cigs \n\ni think what it comes down to is there are too many uber religious people in power \n\nbe are be \n\nalright\n\nso yeah \n\nthese uber religious officials are using their power to promote their religious beliefs and banish all those that dont agree \n\nalright\n\nexactly\n\nit would be logical if they came up with some reasons as to why, but they dont because they're all religious \n\nreligious reasons\n\nand that wouldnt pull through if they let that be known \n\nany suggestions anybody? \n\nnope, and thats where most of the opposition comes from \n\nwith activists like fred phelps \n\nnever really was, just didnt become a large issue until today \n\na much larger and open gay community exists today \n\nsan francisco does \n\nin this country it would probably be the bible \n\nid go with catholic \n\nthough i cant assure \n\nit just seems to have a great impact \n\nespecially with the tyrant we have in office now \nyes it did\n\nit did, and i got the memo \n\nthe bibes have been translated and retranslated its impossible to say which one carries the original meaning \n\nits meant as a way of life for you to decide, not for your country to \n\naccording to it god gave free will to man and let him choose, so why try to enforce the opposite\n\nbut did we know the laws they would make? \n\nyou cant trust a mans heart \n\nyes and we can change them \n\nbut its up to them to reign with our trust \n\nand they have failed us \n\nand many dont \n\nbut its nice to try and find a happy medium rather than say \"WE'RE RIGHT YOU'RE WRONG\" \n\nand the worst part is it almost seems that people are diverging from the good lessons taught by their relgions \n\nlike that church that fred phelps runs \n\nthey praised the killers of matthew sheppard \n\njust because he was gay \n\nthey built a memorial for him \n\n \"matthew sheppard entered hell on _____\" \n\nnow that doesnt seem too bible friendly \n\nthough there an extreme, its still an example of how some people are taking their views out of proportion \n\nsaw a picture of him with 2 kids on either side \n\nand the kids pulled away their coats \n\nand one shirt said He's and the other said \"gay\" \n\nthe laramie project \n\nsp? \n\na play about homosexuals or something (i didnt see it, anybody have some information\n\nokay\n\nthe problem though is when all church begin to deserting the original intents of the bible and going on religious crusades to stop one thing or another based on a couple words \n\nlike our current president has tried with gay marriage \n\nanybody got some werds\n\nim not sure about that one \n\nbut we could see it happen with the democratic takeover\n\nwell the current republican view is more or less against it \n\nprobably more \n\nso it probably wouldnt be changed with them in power \n\nso maybe well see with the change \n\nyeah\n\n guess we could talk about the amendment\n\n first amendment that would restrict the people rather than the government \n\nyes\n\ni dont see why they shouldnt \n\npeople are people \n\npeople can love who they want and want to spend their life with whoever \n\nno matter what age, race, sex etc \n\nhow about you donny? \n\nalright so we're all in agreement about that \n\ni dont have a problem with it \n\nin many cultures it is perfectly acceptable to be with someone of the same sex \n\nin roman culture it was looked up upon to have a lover of the same sex \n\nyes \n\nHELLYEAH\n\nbecause if you fought alongside your lover youd perform better\n\nor so they felt \n\ni forget what culture it is, but they believe that it means something spiritual if you are attracted to the opposite sex \n\nnot opposite\n\ni meant same \n\nyeah it was something along those lines \n\nhoorah\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "well i personally am completely for gay marraige, so i would definitely oppose both of these things. where do you guys stand on the issue? \n\nwhy were you against if you don't mind my asking? \n\nand what made you change your mind? \n\nthat's an interesting perspective \n\nso if it were the choice of the individual would it be different? \n\nwell it's not very likely that everyone would choose to be gay \n\nbut i think if anyone did, we should allow them to \n\ndoes anyone know if it's determined whether homosexuality is genetic or not\n\nok i saw posters for that around campus \n\ni could see people choosing that, maybe to be different, but i also think it is most likely genetic \n\nyeah, there were a lot of closet gays back in the day \n\nso there is a lot of evidence for its being genetic \n\nyes, i would say so\n\nwell maybe we should define marraige first \n\nis it a legal union or just a union? \n\ni didn't mean legal implications so much as the necessity of a union being legal for it to be considered marraige \n\nlike can you be married if you are not legally bound to the person?\n\nyes, so if you didn't have the legal certificate, is it marraige? \n\nso then the government does have a say in marraige \n\nyeah it should be the same for both \n\nso if the govt is needed to make a marraige legal, then we need the govt to make a gay marraige legal \n\nso it's going to be unequel, no matter what, because the catholic church won't endorse it even if the govt does \n\nwell, that would stand only for catholics, it could theoretically be equal in other religions provided the govt agrees \n\nyes, that is what i mean \n\nyeah, i think we are all in agreement \n\nwhat do you mean by provide the process, goldeneye? \n\nso they should just let it happen like any other marraige \n\nthere should be no distinction \n\ndo you think there are any non-genetic factors?\n\nor having a homosexual family member? \n\nwell if you had a gay brother, say, would that influence your sexual orientation?\n\nwell i dont think it would affect my opinions \n\ni dont think that would ever work! \n\nthats terrible too! \n\nand that there would have to be something wrong with you \n\nyes\n\nwell how would you determine if that person actually had the gay gene or were just faking it? \n\nok\n",

true \n\nyeah \n\nno, but they most likely will \n\nyeah \n\ni think more students should kno bout this though \n\nbecause i think they put up pictures on facebook like its nothing not knowing that

still belong to mark wwhatever his last name is \n\nlol\n\ntoo much almost \n\nits going to be funny if this facebook guy wants to use these pictures as blackmail when we all become famous lol \n\nthat will be an interesting case \n\nwhen it comes to national security, i think the gov has to do what they have to do \n\nright \n\nits their job \n\nexactly\n\nespecially if it could lead

school? \n\no ok \n\nwell its good that they stopped it \n\nwell, technically it was an invasion, but for a valid reason \n\nbut if youre going to post something like that on myspace i guess youre looking for an invasion of privacy \n\nits his private thoughts no matter what, making it an invasion, but in this case it was justified \n\nand if you dont want your privacy to be invaded you probably shouldnt post it on the internet \n\nlol\n\nyea, exactly \n\nhe couldnt have intended for it to be private \n\nanyone can access a myspace \n\nwell, if he tried to use invasion of privacy in his defense i guess he was somewhat justified because they read what he posted, but i think hes using that as an excuse\n\ni cant imagine he would post something on myspace and not expect it to get read \n\nespecially something like that \n\nthats true \ni guess it depends how he \"posted\" it, if it was public then im not sure it counts as being private \n\ni dont know a lot about myspace \n\ni dont know a lot about myspace \n\nbut wait \n\ncan people youre not friends with access your myspace page? \n\noh then nevermind\n\ni thought it was like facebook \n\nyeah, his friends def should have contacted someone \n\nits not invasion if they were contacted, it would be invasion maybe if they thought he seemed suspicious and then hacked into it \n\nwithout anyone contacting them \n\nyeah\n\nyes i think so \n\nbut i doubt they would be stupid enough to post threatening things after getting caught \n\ni dont think thats invasion \n\naha thats true \nit shouldnt be invasion of privacy if they were conviced, after that pretty much everything you do should be monitered in a sense \n\nyeah\n\nfor example if they read what he said to his friend and he said something like: hey i hate english i could kill my teacher \n\nor something \n\nidk if that makes sense \n\nteenagers tend to use slang that could be considered more dangerous than they mean it to be \n\ni guess is my point \n\nyeah exactly \n\nyeah \n\nyeah and once they have something on their record they tend to be assumed guilty \n\nyeah, thats fair \n\nkind of like how you cant say bomb on an airplane anymore \n\nteenagers need to curb what they say \n\nno\n\nthats not invasion of privacy \n\nif your friend is in trouble you have every right to try to help them \n\nno\n\naha\n\nEOOO \n\nWOO*\n\nesp myspace \n\nyeah i dont really agree with schools that check kids backpacks every morning when they come in \n\na lot of high schools do \n\nespecially after columbine \n\nwell, it happens more in public schools especially in bad areas \n\nand kids that had things like swiss army knives in their bags werent nescessarily going to use them to kill their peers \n\ni think they should only check lockers tho if they have a reason \n\nyeah \n\nthere was a boy in our brother high school that fixed peoples ipods \n\nand he had one in his locker that was reported stolen \n\nand he got kicked out \n\nstuff like that isnt fair \n\nyeah thats true \n\nand also you hear about people \"planting\" things \n\nand then no one really knows who to believe\n\nexactly\n\nyeah thats how it was at my school \n\nwe had to use locks they provided \n\nand they had all the combos \n\nyeah, but at the same time they shouldnt be allowed to check your things unless someone reports that they heard something bad or saw you with something \n\nyeah, thats true they tend to blame everyone for something 2% of the population of students would even consider doing \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Lol)\n\nlikewise\n\nbut even if i wasn't a catholic, i think i'd still have the same opinion on it \n\nmarriage isn't \"sacred\" only because it's a thing within the church, the reason people see it in a way that noone wants to change it is because that's what most people in history have percieved it as \n\ndid that make sense? \n\ni think the gov't. gives more rights to heterosexual couples because it helps out our society on a financial basis \n\nwhat are the main \"rights\" that you guys are focussing on?\n\nit's all good \n\nwell \n\nmarriage was within the church, and when church and state united a long time ago, the state took that within itself \n\nthat's why i think that \"marriage\" should stay within the church, and for the gov't. to call it something else \n\ntotally agree \n\ni mean, that's not looking down on anybody \n\nso you're saying that the govn't would recognize EVERYONE with a certain term who is together, but marriage would only apply to couples within the church? \n\njust making sure i have it right \n\nwho cares? \n\ni mean \n\nso what if \"marriage\" only applies to catholics, or others within the church \n\nit's not like people will hate catholics or vice versa \n\nwell, banning gay MARRIAGE i'm totally cool with \njust change the word like we were saying for everyone in general, and that amendment won't make a difference \n\nkeep in mind that our country is based on religion \n\nhow is it not?????? \n\nare you kidding me? \n\nTrue\n\ndoes anybody have any personal experiences with this, like talking to other gay people about it? \n\ni'm in the dark on this one too \n\nexpand then \n\ntrying to keep the conversation going...lol) \n\n(yesss) \n\ni don't mean to sound like a girl, but everybody want's loooooove, that's what humans do \n\nthat was totally late also \n\nyou mean change the word for only the government, right? \n\nok, right \n\ncan you go into some more detail witht hat? \n\nmelissa, are we allowed to use like the internet here, or no? \n\nfor future reference, yeah \n\nok, thanks \n\ni don't think that politicians are necessarily doing it only for the vote, i mean, the people who get that high up are VERY opinionated on everything, so they already have their opinions basically set in stone \n\ni don't follow that rosie crap, but what politicians are with her?\n\n(dah, they're not gonna just change their views like that....people'd call them out on that)\n\ni'm cool with it, but you do need to keep in mind that those kids will possibly have a rough time growing up\n\ni mean \n\nas a kid if you're gay, you'll get made fun of\n\nand if you have gay parents, kids will obviously do the same\n\ni never said that \n\ni was talking about getting made fun of \n\nwell i meant have the discrimination involving gays since his parents are\n\nthis next thing is just for me \n\ni'm not against gays, but it really grosses me out \n\nis anybody the same way?\n\nno, i know \n\nwhat do you mean by \"society wise?\" \n\nGREAT TOPIC\nLol\n\nso here it is \n\nare people born gay or not?> \n\nok, my neighbor has to turn out gay when he's older \n\nhe's acted very feminine most of his life \n\nright now he's like 11 \n\nyou know, sometimes you can tell \n\ni never said he is \n\ntwo totally things \n\nplus\n\nhas anybody seen \"dirty work?\"\n\nthere's a gay german shepherd, and it's hilarious \ni had to say that, sorry \n\ni've seen discrimination against people who act gay, but who aren't gay\n\nguys who act feminine is the best way to say that i mean \n\nwell it's improved i'd say...i mean, can you imagine the gay people in schools years ago? \n\nexpand on that \n\nif you could \n\nwell \n\nin all honesty \n\ni think that everyone is more discriminatory against guys thatn girls in this\n\ni mean \n\ngo up to anybody, would you rather see guys or girls making out? \n\ndefinitely the chicks \n\ni mean, i saw 300 yesterday, and it was in there \n\neven most girls i've talked to say that \n\ni guess it's because girls are naturally more pretty than guys\n\nit's true though \nhhahahaha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "Nope\n\nthat's on the discovery channel \n\nit's crap \n\nlol\n\nthey found a tomb of some ancient people...so they probaby automatically assumed JESUS! \n\nLol\n\nI don't think so \n\nI mean \n\nwhy should a religion change to fit what people want? \n\nthe way i figure it \n\npeople want the church to change because of things that they don't personally agree with \n\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! THE INTERNET HAS GOT LITLESTANEMONE!!!!!\n\ni don't see the point in doing that \n\ni mean \n\na religion wouldn't be a steadfast religion if it changed as times changed\nas in constantly \n\nSo if the Church would change, what do you guys think that it would change?\n\nthey obviously don't want that, yeah \n\nwell in reality, if people are going away from religion based upon stuff like that, then they don't have enough faith in their own religion anyways \n\ni figure the church made itself the way it is for specific reasons, and therefore i don't hink that it should change, like having women priests...etc\n\ni figure that they can be nuns and thats good enough \n\nit's kind of like how guys and girls have different sports? i guess is the best way to explain it \n\ni realize that \n\nlol\n\ni'm not saying they'd be bad at being priests\n\nand i'm not putting down on nuns \n\nchurch is about giving ones self into service of God and others\n\nwell they work their way up \"the chain”\n\nyeah\n\nwell they don't really make a lot of money, but like housing and stuff is provided for i thought \n\n(priests) \n\nbut they also make an oath of \"joyful service\"\n\ni talked with father rossi about that the other day \n\nwell, i attended a talk \n\ni really have no clue \n\nbtw, i looked it up and it looks like the whole just male priests bit is based upon the 12 apostles \n\nhere, i found this on a website \n\n\"Only a baptized man (vir) receives sacred ordination. The lord jesus chose men (viri) to form the college of the twelve apolstles, and the apolstles did the same when they chose collaborators to succeed them in their ministry. \n\nThe college of bishops, with whom the priests are united in the priesthood, makes the college of the twelve an ever-present and ever-active reality until Christ's return. The Churhc recognizes herself to be bound by this choice made by the Lord Himself. For this reason the ordination of women is not possible.\n\nthey just feel like if Christ made the decision of that, then that would probably be the best decision \n\nwell going back to the whole jesus didn't look to far ahead comment, the church believes in divine omnipotence \n(sorry, a little late) \n\nit depends on which parts of the bible \n\nwhich is a problem i'll say \n\n(frogger, where are yougetting your information? is it just assumed or is it factual?) \n\nLol\n\nwhat does your uncle think? \n\nif you talk to a priest about it, you should think differently \n\nespecially here at loyola \n\nhow old's your aunt? \n\nyeah \n\nany church i have seen would support the person \n\nand some priests are just jerks....they're all different- they're human\n\nso do you guys think like if they had voting things within the church for priests and nuns that everything would be better? \n\ni do think that that would help out obviously a LOT \n\nwell the way i'd figure it would be the voting could be for reference reason sfor the guys way up \n\ni agree with dah \n\nno, my parents are devout catholics, and they'd totally support that (they're over 50) \n\ndifferent generation...different views..) \n\nyeah, we need to remember that changing the church would change it all over the world, not just the U.S....so if priests around the world don't agree with the U.S...tough luck, that's the way it goes... \n\nfor that reason, since the U.S. would be the minority, i don't hink that it should change\n\nwe need to keep the majority of the church happy \n\ncan you imagine out much controversy that would create?\n\nlol \n\ni can't \n\nlol \n\ni know \n\nhaha\n\nwell Germany would definitely be against it with benny D as pope\n\npeople die every day in africa for being christian \n\ni think if their thoughts are that steadfast, then they won't want to change\n\ni had a priest from africa talk to my church about it \n\nwell...it was kind of depressing \n\nlol\n\ni know, i was joking \n\nbut look at it that way \n\nif you're dying for a cause \n\nwould you want the cause not to steady, but changing a lot? \n\ni sure as hell wouldn't want that \n\nkew \n\n\n\n\n"

        "\tMarijuana usage and possession have been a big issue in our country since it was illegalized. In the 1970’s marijuana was used habitually by many individuals. Although it is illegal, there are many people who still illegally use and sell this drug.\n      Recently in the city of Denver, they have legalized the possession of marijuana in small amounts. I don’t think that this is a good idea. To legalize this drug, even in small amounts is giving the country permission to use it. This is not a good step for our country to be taking. I feel as though this drug is better off being illegal. The movie The Breakfast Club comes to mind, when John shouts out, “If he gets up, we’ll all get up!  It’ll be anarchy!” This movie, which centers on the life of delinquents in high school, shows some of these students smoking marijuana. This is part of what makes them the “bad kids” that they are. By legalizing marijuana, this task does not seem as bad. The world would be very different. The people of the 60’s and 70’s, who used marijuana heavily, would never have stopped. Our world could be much different as it is today. Picture how the prohibition of alcohol in the 1920’s changed the alcohol industry. If marijuana had never been illegalized, there would be many people under its influence today.\n      There is only one purpose for which marijuana should be legal. In the case of medicinal marijuana, it is possible that this drug can help patients of cancer get through the side effects of chemotherapy. It can also be used for other medical purposes. In this case, when marijuana is prescribed for a patient’s health care, I think that the usage of marijuana is ok.\n      An argument for the legalization of marijuana is that the effects of marijuana are similar to those of alcohol, why should alcohol be legal and not other drugs? Personally, I don’t feel that alcohol has the same effects as marijuana. I think that marijuana has a stronger effect in smaller amounts. It makes people act much differently, and it is harder to control when people are under the influence of this drug. In the case of the city of Denver, why legalize it at all if you are only going to legalize it in small amounts?\n      Marijuana is like any other drug, it is still used often by many people even though it is illegal. The same goes with underage drinking of alcohol, people who want to use it find ways to do so. It is important that our country keeps up with its regulation of these violations as well as they can. I have many friends who would love for marijuana to be legalized in the United States; however, personally I don’t think it should be. I don’t agree with the usage of marijuana, I don’t like the way it affects people and controls what they do and how they think. I think the country has made a smart decision by sticking with their law. \n\n\nIdo not agree with the city of Denver's decision to legalize marijuana. I believe that if marijuana was legalized it would be harmful to us instead of helpful. The only positive side effect of marijuana is when it is used to treat medical patients. I think that it should be legal for this reason only. Other then that effect marijuana is harmful to your body and your mind. I do have friends that would be 100% for the legalization, however I don't think that this drug has had a positive effect on them. The argument could be made that the effects are similar to those of alcohol, but i have seen them as having different effects.\n\n\nUm\nI don’t think that marijuana should be legalized in\nUm\nEven in small forms\nUh\nThe only way that I think that marijuana should be legalized is for medical uses\n\nAnd in that case that’s not really a law that has to be done\nIt’s just the doctor can prescribe it to you\n\nSo I don’t think that there is any reason for people over 21 to have it\nEven in small quantities. \n\nUm\nSure\nI just don’t think\nI mean\nUm\nIts\nUh\nA very harmful drug to you especially when people get like addicted to it\nAnd I just don’t think there’s\nUh\nAny reason for people to\nFor that to be legal\nUh \nThey’ve \nUm\nHad problems\nThey didn’t want to legalize it before so I don’t\nI don’t understand why even in small quantities it should be legal\n\n\nUm\nThe only positive that I could possibly see is that the people who\nUh\nWere using for medical uses it would probably be easier for them to have it and it would be less of a problem\nBut the people who are using it now for medical reasons\nI don’t think they would have much of a problem\nSo\nSo yeah that’s\n\nUm\nWell I know they use it for cancer patients if they \nUm\nTo make them feel better\n\nSo I don’t know much about it\n\n\nUm no\nI don’t think\nI think that it’s on a higher scale \nI don’t think it should be legal\n\nUm\nI just don’t really approve of it\nI don’t really like that \nUm\nI don’t really like the smell of it\nI don’t really like it\nSo I don’t think that it should be legal\n\nNo\n \n\nNo\n\n\n\nI mean drunk driving, one you know right on top\n\nLike LSD like [laughter] not the same kind of thing\n\nI mean definitely for medical use like if it can help you, why not?",
        "\tThe legalization of marijuana is a wonderful idea for a variety of reasons.  First of all, crime would drop dramatically.  In places like Amsterdam and Canada, where limited amounts of marijuana are legal, crime rates are extremely low.  Also, jails in our country would have more space for criminals more at fault then a person with a marijuana problem who is otherwise innocent.  Aside from these reasons, if marijuana were legal, the government could tax it and help our country move out of the economic secession we have fallen into over the past several years.\n\tMarijuana effects are very similar, if not less dangerous, than the effects of alcohol.  While marijuana has no scientifically proven negative side effects, the negative side effects of alcohol are numerous.  Also, many people I know would smoke marijuana and drive a car with full confidence but would never get behind the wheel after having a single drink.  If an intoxicating substance as dangerous as alcohol is fully legal after 18 or 21, marijuana should be as well.\n\n\n    I feel that the legalization of marijuana is a good idea for many reasons. First, as opposed to alcohol, marijuana has no negative side effects. Second, there are no proven health risks to marijuana. Alcohol, on the other hand, has tons of negative side effects, both long-term and immediate. Third, if marijuana were legal, there would be much less crime. In Amsterdam, where marijuana is legal to a certain extent, crime is almost nonexistent. Fourth, if marijuana were legal, its price would certainly drop, and Americans would not have to waste so much money buying it. Whether you drink or you smoke marijuana, both will make you intoxicated in some way. However, alcohol brings with it many negative side effects and health risks. As long as alcohol is legal, marijuana should be legal as well.\n\n\nWell um \nI think it’s a pretty good idea because \nUm \nI think uh most people treat alcohol and marijuana as two completely separate topics \nBut uh \nI think they’re \nThey’re closely linked in that they’re both they’re both \nUm you know \nThey’re both vices \nAnd they both have \nUm \nI don’t know if you wanna say benefits \nBut \nThey both have separate benefits and obviously bad things about them \nUm \nSo I think having alcohol as a legal substance is kinda hypocritical when it doesn’t go along with marijuana \n\nWell \nUm \nI think they both make you intoxicated in different ways \nUm \nI don’t know if there’s been different studies and stuff but it seems like um driving\nUm \nDrinking impairs your driving more and motor skills or things like that \nUm \nAlso \nI mean they have \nThey’re different \nBad things about them like drinking obviously hurts your liver and \nUm marijuana I’m not sure if it was proven but they say kills brain cells and stuff \nSo I mean \nI think that both should be treated as kind of a \nThe same kind of thing on the same level \nSo I think its kind of hypocritical to have alcohol as a legal substance when its not accompanied with marijuana \n\nUh yeah \nI would say so cause I \nMe personally I think alcohol is the worse vice than marijuana I think \nUm \nThe danger is greater with alcohol and \nUm \nI mean if I were to pick one that \nI mean both are bad but \nIf I were to pick one kinda like a lesser of two evils I would say marijuana \n\nWell \nUm \nI mean drunk drivers you hear about all the time on on the uh \nFrom the media and everything \nAlso \nUm \nThe health implications are more \nUm \nI guess like solid the the research or whatever \nLike I mean if you drink you know you’re gonna hurt your liver and other things as well \nBut marijuana it doesn’t seem like there’s any solid evidence towards any real long term health risks \nI mean uh \nThey say there’s some implication of brain cell damage I’m not sure if any of that is really solid or whatever \n\nUh no \n\n\n\nOne main issue I have is um  how alcohol and cigarettes are both legal and they both have their you know positives and negatives so I mean uh I don't see a big difference between that and marijuana both of those\n\nYeah\n\nAlcoholism and liver\n\nI think they need to like like get and exact definition of what a drug is because I mean just like you said grouping marijuana with all those other physically addictive\n\nYeah, like hallucinogens like that I mean it just seems I don't know not smart\n \nWould you think that they should legalize it or just leave it for the medicinal purposes?",
        "\tPersonally, I think cigarettes should be made illegal.  So why would I support the legal smoking of marijuana, which is even more harmful to the lungs?  People throw lawsuits left and right when asbestos is discovered in their workplace because they’re so afraid that if they breathe it in they’ll get cancer, and some of those same people smoke two packs a day.  If asbestos is illegal, cigarettes, along with their counterparts cigars, chewing tobacco, and joints, should be illegal as well by logic.\n\tThe argument is made that marijuana has effects similar to alcohol on the body, and if alcohol is legal then how can marijuana be outlawed?  The fact, however, remains that marijuana is significantly different from alcohol.  Alcohol such as red wine has been shown in small doses to be beneficial to the body by improving heart health.  Of course, like many drugs, if abused it can be extremely dangerous.  But the only beneficial effect of marijuana on the body is that it relieves pain - and so do lots of other drugs.  The harm of breathing in marijuana smoke far outweighs any benefits to be gained.  If you’re in pain, take Vicodin or a drug that won’t give you lung cancer 20 years later.\n\tAnother problem with Denver is the legalization of “small” amounts of marijuana.  How does one go about regulating marijuana?  There’s no proof system like for alcohol - batches of marijuana are mixed with different materials so that each has a different strength and composition.  And justifying its legality by saying it can only be purchased and used in small amounts is a pretty ineffective way of controlling its use.  Who’s to prevent people from purchasing multiple batches and using them all at once?  And does this mean that a legal marijuana content for the body will have to be established, like the BAC, to prevent people from driving under the influence?  I would like to hear how Denver plans on regulating the consumption of marijuana to keep it safe.\n\tPlus, although marijuana and alcohol are both addictive in certain situations, marijuana is known as a “gateway drug” while alcohol doesn’t usually lead to doing harder drugs.  Many people who smoke marijuana move on to harder drugs like cocaine as they build up a tolerance.  Allowing marijuana to be used legally could eventually lead to the legalization of other, more dangerous, drugs as well.  Once marijuana use becomes commonly accepted, the standards of what constitutes “drug abuse” will change and accept other drugs like cocaine for “limited” legal use.  Instead of relaxing our standards to accept more drugs, we should tighten them to include nicotine as a drug which should be made illegal.\n\tOne could argue that legalization of marijuana will make it safer for those who use it, because they don’t have to follow illegal routes to get it and the composition could be federally regulated.  It would eliminate some drug dealers and deaths due to contaminated drug batches.  The problem is, marijuana isn’t that much of a problem in those departments.  Marijuana dealers can be the kid sitting next to you in freshman English your first year of high school, and most times contaminated drug batches are an issue with more expensive and dangerous drugs that are cut with random materials.  Really, legalizing marijuana will do nothing more than give the police more of a headache in deciding what is legal and what is not, and cause more lung cancer and addiction.\n\n\nI have a problem with the legalization of marijuana both in theory and in practicality.  In theory, people argue that marijuana has similar effects to alcohol so if alcohol is legal, marijuana should be too.  In reality, marijuana's effects are NOT the same as alcohol's.  Marijuana is an unclassified drug: it has characteristics of a halluicogen and narcotic, among others.  Alcohol is simply a depressant - it slows down the body's nervous system and thought processes.  Marijuana, on the other hand, has different effects on different people, and affects many different parts of the brain.",
        "\tLet me begin by saying that I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer.  There are hundreds of different drugs that we dispense daily, all of them having some medical purpose.  We have many drugs that are known as “controlled substances.”  These drugs must always be kept under lock and key because of their addictive properties.  We have several derivatives of opiates like morphine and dilaudid that are very similar in structure to heroin.  These drugs are legal, but they are controlled, and the system works very well.  We occasionally dispense THC in tablet form, the active ingredient in marijuana.\n\tThe point is this.  Marijuana, when used for medical purposes can be quite beneficial.  Just because it is an illegal drug, people think it has nothing but bad properties.  Marijuana should become legal for medical use because it can help people struggling with glaucoma or cancer.\n\tPast experience shows that highly addictive drugs can be used safely when they are labeled with the “controlled substance” tag.  However, I believe it would be a mistake to allow the public to freely use marijuana, as Denver has done somewhat.  People would abuse marijuana because they have been used to so many years of being told they can’t have it.  When you tell people they can’t have something, it is natural for them to want to get it.  It would be a very big risk to public safety.  People would be driving when they are high, because they would think that since marijuana is now legal, they can legally drive around with it in their bloodstream.  Accidents would increase, and more people would get hurt.\n\tOnce the taboo of marijuana has been done away with (this would take many years), then I would say that it can be safely legalized, in much the same way as alcohol is today.\n\tMarijuana’s effects are not so nasty that it turns people into zombies.  It is not addictive, and it is hard to overdose with it.  For these reasons, I believe that it should not be treated as harshly as other illegal drugs like cocaine and heroine.  It quite simply is not that bad.  But the government has chosen to come down hard on marijuana, probably because it was once widely used (and still is).  Because the government says marijuana is so bad, people naturally try to get their hands on it.  They in effect have shot themselves in the foot by prohibiting its usage completely and tricking people into thinking that its worse than it really is.\n\tMarijuana is a drug in its own category.  Cocaine and heroine could never be legalized for public usage, but I think marijuana, with time, could be.  With time is the key word.  First, I say make it available for medical use.  Then, with time, the taboo surrounding marijuana will dissipate, and people will be able to use it responsibly.  Also, it is worth noting that the prison systems are way too overfilled.  This is largely the result of teenagers getting caught with marijuana.  Legalizing marijuana could be a long term remedy for this problem.\n\n\n    I feel that much of the negative attitude toward marijuana, and other drugs for that matter, stems from the illegal drug trade around the world.  Having a drug legally available for consumption turns it into a whole different story.  I have a summer job working in a hospital pharmacy.  One thing I don't think people realize is that a drug is a drug.  Many of them, including the ones in the hospital, have harmful side-effects that are far greater than those of marijuana.  In fact, our pharmacy stocks THC, the hallucinatory ingredient in marijuana, in pill form.\n    I'm not saying that marijuana should be made into an over the counter drug.  It would have to be prescribed by a doctor of course.  There are many other drugs that are available for use with prescription, such as Percoset, Vicodan, and other opiate derivatives.  These drugs are highly addictive, but marijuana is not.  Yet they are legal and marijuana is not\n    If a drug has some benefit (and marijuana does) I think it should be utilized.  As far as it being available to the general public – like alcohol for example - this would not be a good idea.",
        "\tAnother controversial issue is the legalization of marijuana. Marijuana seems to entice many people when they just want to “chill out”. Marijuana has been studied for years with scientific findings that prove that marijuana does not have positive effects on individuals. I do not think that most people truly know the side effects of marijuana and therefore feel that this is the drug, if any, to abuse. I believe that the city of Denver has made a mistake in legalizing small amounts of marijuana for people over the age of 21. Now, just like with alcohol, 21 year olds can buy for underage individuals. An underage individual does not even necessarily need a 21 year old; they just need his or her ID. I do not agree with the city of Denver and their decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana. \n\tIn my email portion of this study, my response was different from what it is now because in between the time, I learned more about the effects of marijuana and what it is doing to a persons body. Personally, I do not feel that marijuana provides any great feeling; I do not think it is that great to risk killing brain cells, or to risk damaging ones lungs. My grandfather was diagnosed with lung cancer almost one year ago. The doctors told him that he had two years to live. He smoked almost ever day of his adult life, cigarettes in the early years and then cigars in the later years. My grandfather was not smoking marijuana, he was smoking tobacco-there is no difference because they produce similar results. I went to visit my grandfather last weekend; he lies in a bed, it hurts to sit up in a chair, he can not move on his own, he needs two nurses to help him go to the bathroom. The cancer moved from his lungs to his bones; he fell a few times, first breaking his left arm and then his hip. My grandfather is 75 years young and was told that he had seven to ten months to live. I do not know what it would feel like to know this. I would probably wonder why this had to happen. My grandfather can not go home in his final months of life; he was placed in a nursing home on Thanksgiving Day. My grandmother can not take care of him on her own- she says all she can do is pray for him. With my grandfather in mind and the memory of him I do not agree with the legalization of marijuana. \n\tI do not feel that marijuana should be legal, but I feel that marijuana’s effects are not as great as alcohol. I do not want alcohol to be illegal, but I feel that it is more lethal then marijuana. Many people abuse alcohol; they believe they can become a different person when under the influence. All alcohol does is make one lose their inhibitions and place one in a situation that they will most likely regret the next day. Marijuana can be used without making a person totally incapable of functioning. I have seen more people pass out or “black out” from alcohol then from marijuana. I have also seen that more people drive when under the influence of marijuana, rather then alcohol, showing that people feel the same or close to the same. Most would not risk getting into a car with a drunk driver, hopefully they would not let a drunk driver in the car seat, but many would not think twice about getting in the car with someone who was high. \n\tPeople are going to make their own choices about the matter of marijuana whether it is legal or not. I believe that Denver took a step in the wrong direction and hopefully other states do not follow in their footsteps. \n\n\nI think that alcohol has a more potent effect than marijuana. Marijuana seems to relax individuals. It seems normal for guys to drive when they are high, but then they would never drive when they are drunk. Weed seems easier to obtain then alcohol, which is strange because the easier one to get is illegal. I think any form of smoking is unnecessary..people are just killing their lungs, so if cigarettes are legal, then they might as well make weed legal. But then, on the other hand, when I think of weed and the people that smoke it, I consider them \"dirtbags\". So I do not think that would create a good image. If we legalized it people would take advantage of it.",
        "\tMarijuana is one of those things that’s still stigmatized for few legitimate reasons, and most of the reasons people feel a certain way about it are also true of alcohol. One huge, bone-crushingly important, monumental difference between the two is this: the government can and does effectively tax the manufacture and distribution of alcohol (and tobacco, for that matter). Denver has taken a step in the right direction, and maybe the only step that needs to be taken. Since people are given permission to carry only small quantities, theoretically this still legislates against large-scale wheeling and dealing while preventing cops from having to divert time and attention to minor drug busts, which are often a waste of resources. \n\tHarsh laws against marijuana indirectly place a major strain upon the law courts and prison systems, since they’re forced to deal with every trifling case of possession or distribution that comes through. The resources could be better spent elsewhere, like stopping the influx of harder drugs into the U.S., or locating meth labs. It should still be a crime to carry and sell pounds of marijuana, but I’d guess that these kinds of cases make up a very small percentage of the total number. \n\tOther drugs have risen and fallen in popularity, but marijuana has been a consistent favorite of people of all ages and backgrounds. The government is wasting its time trying to eradicate its usage, as though getting rid of pot will solve some of society’s major ills. It’s a mind-altering substance in the same way alcohol is, and last time I heard statistics cited, the number of people killed by drunk drivers was astronomically higher than the number killed those who drive while high. Also, I’ve never heard of any “angry stoners”, but there are a lot of angry and abusive drunks.\n\tI’m not advocating marijuana usage as necessarily being a good idea, but there are a lot worse ones. As with most things, it’s not that harmful in moderation; in fact, the smoke is much cleaner than that of most commercial cigarettes. The problem is that it’s stereotyped as the gateway drug of choice of all manner of social degenerates, subversives, and general ne’er-do-wells. Oh, and young people. People frequently use it in excess, of course, but the exact same could be said for Loyola students who start going to bars on Wednesday and Thursday nights during the school week.\n\tEventually, the government is going to have to confront the issue head-on, and that will be a political spectacle worth watching. Just imagine expert witnesses brought before Congress in order to testify on the nature of marijuana smoking. C-SPAN’s ratings will soar. But that’s besides the point. The point is that usage of drugs like marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco is ultimately one of personal volition and responsibility. If the negative effects of the latter two are minimal enough that we permit their widespread usage, there’s no viable reason the former shouldn’t be allowed as well. \n\n\nDear CMC Study,\n\nI think the primary reason that marijuana is illegal is because the government can't tax it. It's long-term effects are no worse than those of cigarettes (and some would argue markedly better), and the immediate effects it produces are similar to those of alcohol. I think that the other major reason it's illegal is because it has a social stigma attached to it, which is a little ridiculous when you examine the other behaviors society is willing to look the other way on. Denver has made a brave and ultimately very good decision. Even from a logistical standpoint, courts are frequently overwhelmed by cases of petty drug charges (and so are prisons, oftentimes), and a law like that helps to lighten that load in the long term. I think that if the government were to begin (trying) to strictly regulate the drug traffic and to legalize small amounts, as Denver has done, it would be a much preferable situation to the one they're dealing with now.\n\nPeace,\n#6\nYour Agent in the Field\n\n\n\nUm \nFrankly I’m ok with it actually \nI don’t really see why marijuana has such a large stigma applied to it \nGenerally I think the effects aren’t much more harmful then alcohol or tobacco in fact from what I know of it marijuana smoke is at least much cleaner then tobacco smoke \nUm \nAt least judging by the stuff they put in tobacco these days \nLast time I checked I think there was small amount percentage of arsenic or something like that \nUm \nReally I think that it’s just more of a social stigma we have applied to it then any actual really long term deleterious effects \nAnd I think that the Denver law prevents large \nIt it still allows officers to enforce against large scale dealing while at the same time it prevents them from having to waste resources on going after ever body who has like \nI don’t I don’t even know how marijuana is measured so \nI can’t give a measurement there but \nFor for ever \nFor going after everyone who has very small quantities of it \nWhich just kind of clogs up the judicial system and wastes the resources of the police \n\nUn-huh \nI think \nUm \nI don’t know \nI just remember seeing that old goofy movie Reefer Madness from back in the 50’s and it seems to me that it’s just one of those things that’s come to be associated with a specific type of person \nLike it’s the drug of choice of African American’s or of young people or of young radicals and so on and so forth and I think that older generations have tended to keep viewing it that way \nAnd because of that the laws really haven’t modified been modified to the extent that they should have \n\nUm \nIn general yes \nI mean \nFrankly you don’t hear about people being wife beaters or getting getting into as many accidents because of marijuana smoking \nUm \nIt seems to me like from what I know of it that the effects in general are very similar to being drunk \nAnd it really isn’t \nIt doesn’t impair people significantly more then alcohol does \nAgain that’s just from what I know of it \nI could be just completely making that up \n\nUh \nNot that I can think of off hand \n\n\n\nYea I don't know any angry potheads.",
        "My big question would be: for what? Why did Denver decide to do this? I mean is it for medical reasons or are they going to be selling “dime bags” at the pharmacy? If marijuana is used for medical reasons to alleviate pain for example during a cancer patient’s chemotherapy then I would say yes this is a good thing. But if they were legalizing marijuana as a way to stop children from buying them then I would say that the state didn’t work hard enough to help children choose a different route. Legalizing marijuana would stop children from buying it as much because I would be tapping into the fact that people want what they can’t have. \n\nMarijuana should be legalized if it were used to help people that were in pain. But that’s the only way I feel it necessary to legalize it. If they were to legalize as a way to decrease the demand then that may lead to legalizing other drugs like cocaine or ecstasy to decrease demand. Either way you look at it marijuana is still a drug so it’s not right to legalize it. But what about alcohol isn’t alcohol a drug? Or can’t it lead to it being a drug? Why don’t we make alcohol illegal then? I digress, but my point is that we should only legalize marijuana if truly necessary. \n\nMarijuana’s effects are not similar enough to alcohol so as to legalize it. Well actually from what I have seen marijuana is actually a lot to legalize than alcohol because people who are “high” usually just sit and don’t do much. Unlike alcohol where a lot of people usually get really reckless, they are the ones who get in car accidents and say things they didn’t mean all for a good time. You really don’t hear of many people smoking weed to get more social able it’s usually to get relax. \n\nAs I continually think about this I have come to the conclusion that they should only legalize marijuana if it will help sick people. Other than that they have no logical reason to legalize marijuana. Marijuana takes away from the lives of young kids who are swooped up into the gang life and killed all for some weed. Its not worth it and especially not worth the lives of innocent people who die from drive by shootings. Marijuana although it isn’t dangerous physically it is dangerous to the people that use it and even to the people that don’t. \n\n\n\nMy best friend went to college this past year and she began smoking\nmarijuana. And so to scare her I wanted to find out if there was any\nparticular cancer or disease that you can get from smoking marijuana and I\nfound nothing. Marijuana is a product of the earth, it doesn't hurt the\nbody you can't get lung cancer from it, there are no toxins in it that can\nharm the the air and other people. So I couldnt tell her to stop because\nit wouldnt harm her. My only problem with marijuana is that it wastes your\ntime. In the time it takes for someone to get high they have to sit there\nand get off there hgih which could take hours.\n\nIn the question you mention about the effects of marijuana, like I said\nbefore I dont think there are any other affects according to what I have\nresearched. Especially none as harmful as alcohol. you have always heard\nof alcohol poiknownsoning and drunk drivers killing innocent people never\nof any one who harmed themselves while getting high on marijuana. Now I\nmay take back the word never but etiher way if there is a case it doesnt\nmake channel nine news at five like drunk driving does. With that being\nsaid, Im actually up in the air on my oponion of the legalization of\nmarijuana in that is doesn't harm anyone it just wastes away peoples time\nbecause once they feel that high they tend to not want to do much of\nanything else. But also if we were to legalize it, would people stop\ntrying so hard to get it and the excitement of getting it would go down.\nBut then that goes to say should we legalize other drugs like speed and\ncocaine...I dont think so!\n\n\n\nAll I got to do is just talk into the microphone? \nOk \nWell \nUm \nActually I think it’s \nI’ve come to believe that \nUm marijuana is actually not a bad thing \nAs much of a bad thing as people say it is \nBut it’s kind of like \nUm like \nI think it’s called a sedative or just something that like will make you not do anything \nBut I mean if it’s like stuff that’ll \nBecause I know like using marijuana like could help you \nLike if you have cancer and stuff like that \nSo I think that’s Ok \nBut I think that they \nUm \nI don’t know I wish they could legalize it and then maybe safeguard it so only like small amounts \nOr maybe like distribute it or something \nCause like smoking marijuana doesn’t give you cancer \nIt just makes you extremely like \nLike I don’t even know like you just sit the whole time and you don’t do anything with your life \nSo I think that in that sense it’s bad \nBecause then with more and more like kids getting their hands on it \nThey just won’t want to do anything \nBut actually it’s kinda \nI guess you could say \nIf they knew \nIf you could figure out a way that they could distribute it for good use and then still keep it way from children so that they don’t \nYou know \nGet their hands on it then I feel like it might be Ok \nLike it’s a little bit better then where it is now \nBecause if you think about it \nMaybe if they legalize it then people wouldn’t want it as much \nSo \nLike that’s why if \nIt’s like the same thing as alcohol like if 18 year-olds get it then 18 year-olds probably wouldn’t have as much problems \nEven not 18 year-olds but younger kids wouldn’t have as much problems with alcohol as they do now because \nYou know \nThey can get their hands on it \nThey kind of have an idea as to how to use it \nInstead of alcohol just being this really bad thing \nSo maybe if they did the same with like \nUm \nWith like marijuana then it probably wouldn’t be as bad \nUm \nI don’t know because I’ve heard that with \nUm \nLike I don’t think their effects are as similar \nI think that because they vary between like different people \nLike I know that \nI know some people that smoke weed and then just sit [laughter] \nSome people smoke weed and they just want to \nI don’t know they \nLike they \nEverything just goes slower for them \nBut actually the only time I know when anybody wants to do anything reckless is when like you get \nSome people get drunk \nLike I know when I get drunk I just sit \nLike I don’t do anything I just get really quiet \nBut other people get drunk and they want to get reckless \nBut you don’t really see like you don’t really see people getting in accidents and stuff like that because they were smoking \nLike you see like \nI mean that’s like the one thing for like \nFor like alcohol and stuff is that they get in accidents and they \nYou know \nDo reckless things or they’ll rob places and \nYou know beat up people or what not \nWhen they’re under the influence of alcohol \nI don’t like \nI don’t even know if you hear anything about when people are smoking \nLike you don’t hear anything \nThe only bad effect of it is that it just makes you not want to do anything and that’s like \nI think that’s like the only thing they can come up with is like they’re not \nThe person’s not the same anymore \nThey just sit \nAll they think about is getting more weed and stuff like that \nThey don’t really \nThey don’t really do anything to them that \nLike as bad as alcohol does \nCause alcohol I think like effects everyone whereas \nUm \nUm weed just kind of effects you as a person \nOk \nYeah \nYeah \nUm \nBesides the effect of like \n I don’t know cause like I kinda feel like it should be legalized in a sense \nBecause like if it helps people \nThen it’s also like \nIt is a drug \nSo it’s kinda like \nKinda \nIt goes back and forth \nCause like if it does help people then sure \nBut if it doesn’t like \nIn the way that it does it help teenagers and stuff like that \nThen no it shouldn’t be \nBut it’s like \nLike I said like \nJust legalizing it in small does will be better and having like a really tight control on who it goes to \nLike better than how they have with alcohol now that even if you are under the age of 21 you can get a fake ID to get it \nSo I think you need to have a tighter control over that because it is a drug \nSo \nOk that’s it \nThat’s all I got \nNo \n\n\n\n\nI feel it'd be good it'd be nice so that way I mean it's people a lot a lot of like today's like legal systems they spend their whole time worrying about everyone and this pot thing and everyone and this marijuana thing and weed and I'm like you have other bigger things to do there are bigger things out there than this weed thing and I mean 21 is a good age 21 is like\n\nDid you say 21 or 25?",
        "\tI personally believe that the possession and use of marijuana should be legal to certain extents.  I feel that age would be one limitation that they would need to place on it, just like alcohol.  It would only make sense considering both tobacco and alcohol have age restrictions.  Though the age would have to be debated about, there still needs to be some kind of limitations so that minors (who may be ignorant to its effects) are not allowed to get their hands on it and ruin themselves.\n\tMarijuana’s effects are very minimal compared to alcohol and are not nearly as dangerous and life threatening.  The only times the use of marijuana can become fatal are if the user has a serious heart problem or consumes up to 2 pounds of it.  The lethal dose of marijuana’s active ingredient (THC) is far unreachable even by some of the most frequent and avid of smokers.  Alcohol on the other hand can very quickly become fatal.  We have all heard about cases of someone giving themselves alcohol poisoning.  This can occur with a very minimal amount of alcohol or a very grand amount of alcohol depending on the tolerance of the user.  While in many situations like this the user can recover after a visit to the hospital and an unpleasant charcoal smoothie, sometimes this can turn into a fatal incident.  It is not often that you see someone sent to the emergency room for smoking too much marijuana.\n\tMarijuana also has much fewer inhibiting effects than alcohol does when ingested. Vision is not so much distorted and the person actually becomes more cautious and aware of their surroundings.  Those on a marijuana high do not overestimate their own abilities, but in fact have a tendency to believe that they are capable of doing less and therefore avoid situations such as driving or walking through a bad neighborhood.  Alcohol on the other hand helps to boost a person’s ego, making them feel invincible.  They believe that they can do anything, even drive.  This will cause them to make some of the bad decisions that someone who has just smoked marijuana would not.  While those who are drunken worry more about themselves and whether or not they are going to get laid that night, those who are high worry more about whether they made it back to the couch in time to catch the Animal Planet special on chimpanzees.\n\tWhile compared to alcohol, marijuana is virtually harmless.  It also has a lot fewer damaging effects on the body.  Alcohol can cause massive damage to the liver and brain.  While it can be argued that marijuana has negative effects on the lungs and brain, studies have started to show that marijuana use can prevent cancerous tumors in the lungs and can even stimulate brain cell growth.  Comparing the two cannot be a valid argument, however, because the only reason alcohol is legal is because of the fight against prohibition.  Though, it is apparent that marijuana is a much safer alternative and really doesn’t have much to argue against it.  As with the gay marriage situation, many people fight the legalization of marijuana because of their moral standpoint.\n\n\nMy thoughts on marijuana are that it should be legal for people over 21. Marijuana's effects aren't very similar to alcohol though.  The effects of marijuana are in fact much less inhibiting.  Alcohol causes you to slur your speech, fall over, overestimate your own abilities (such as being able to drive a car), and more or less deals a lot more damage healthwise (like it does to your liver and brain).\nMarijuana on the other hand slows down the thought process, gives you a lightheaded-highlike feeling, increases philosophical thought and significantly increases appetite.  While smoking anything can cause potential health risks, marijuana does much less damage to the brain than alcohol does.  In fact, some studies are beginning to point out some of the medical uses of marijuana, and one has even been set out to try to show that marijuana actually increases brain cell growth. If it were a match of which should be legal between alcohol and marijuana, my vote would go towards marijuana.  However, I feel that both should be legal anyway, especially since the effects of marijuana are much less detremental both in the short term and long term.",
        "      It’s difficult for someone of my limited knowledge to come to a decisive conclusion about the use of marijuana.  The nature and effects of alcohol are more frequently addressed and explained for public knowledge than those of other narcotics.  Before my first semester at Loyola started, I was required to complete a three hour course of alcohol education.  This course included several tests and surveys.  I was never informed about the possible damaging effects of marijuana, although I can say from experience that its illegal usage certainly rivals the illegal consumption of alcohol.  In the process of deciding on the legality of marijuana, it is helpful to examine the nature and the effects of other legal substances such as alcohol and cigarettes.  \n      Several scientific studies have proven that alcohol, when consumed in a moderate fashion, can be beneficial to one’s health.  Doctors have found that marijuana has certain health benefits as well.  It helps relieve pain for patients who suffer from such chronic diseases as multiple sclerosis.  Despite the advantages of medicinal use, I do not know of any positive effects that marijuana may have on a typical, relatively healthy person.  I do, however, remember reading an article in Time magazine about the detriments it poses to such a person’s health.  Marijuana can impair the cognitive memory and cause damage to short-term memory.  And of course, smoking in general, whether it is cigarettes or marijuana, harms the lungs.  \n      Cigarettes continue to be legal for those over a certain age even after years of research and countless studies have revealed their extremely harmful effects.  I will not list all of them here but the most detrimental to a smoker’s health is the high risk of developing lung cancer.  And in the worst cases, the cancer kills them.  Unlike alcohol, cigarettes posses no redeeming health benefits when consumed in moderation.  Marijuana shares this lack, so is it unfair that marijuana is illegal while smoking is not?\n      There are many who claim that the legalization of marijuana, according to strict distribution and consumption laws, would help to combat illegal drug trafficking.  This is a naïve viewpoint to take.  If the production and sale of marijuana is removed from the hands of drug traffickers (which will be a difficult task in itself), there are a myriad of other drugs for them to choose from.  The only way that the government has a chance of ending the trafficking of illegal drugs is to make all narcotics legal.\n      I can understand the reasons why people think that marijuana should not be illegal.  But I am not aware of any valid reasons why people think that marijuana should be legal.  The recreational use of marijuana offers not health benefits but definite health hazards.  Not only does marijuana threaten the health of the user, but its effects on the user may directly affect others in negative ways as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am quite shocked about this actually.  I had no idea that something like this was even being considered.  I know that the issue of medicinal marijuana has often been discussed, and for that I see some sort of beneficial purpose and good intention.  When hospital patients are in extreme pain, as when they suffer from some sort of chronic illness, sometimes marijuana may be the only thing that relieves that pain.  However, I'm not sure if I can discern any good reason why recreational marijuana should be legal.\n\nMarijuana is very much like alcohol in the negative and often dangerous effects it has on people.  But marijuana does not have any redeeming positive effects.  You see, if alcohol is consumed in moderation, studies have shown that it can be beneficial for one's health (lowering blood pressure and things like that).  Marijuana actually poses a more dangerous health threat than alcohol, because smoking marijuana, like smoking anything, damages your lungs.\n\nThis topic raises many questions for me.  How much marijuana is legal?  How much can you have and still be able to drive?  I keep thinking of a commercial that I used to see all the time, about a teenage driver who hit his brother and killed him.  The point of the commercial was that the driver was NOT drunk; he was HIGH.",
        "\tI absolutely support the legalization of marijuana. The reality is, pot, in many ways, is no different from alcohol. In fact, it’s probably safer simply because you can’t kill yourself from overdosing, the way you can with alcohol and many other drugs. Certainly there are risks to using any drug, and there would have to be restrictions put upon activities such as driving, but allowing the use of a small amount of legalized pot would do the world no harm.\n\t I have a personal interest in marijuana being legalized. A majority of my close and lasting friendships, from high school through to college, began, or were nurtured, through a common bond: marijuana. I’ve met a lot of people after someone asks the question, “hey, want to smoke?” Some might consider this shallow, and my friendships \nunhealthy, but the reality is, I’ve never met a group of people as close as my friends. We’ve stuck together through break ups and people moving away, through college and \nfights. I can go to any of my close friends for advice on anything, and we can talk intelligently about sports, politics, philosophy, and a whole number of things. If given \nthe chance, we could certainly disprove many misconceptions people may have about youth who smoke marijuana. \n\t Marijuana should be legalized because its affects are similar, and probably milder, than those of alcohol. Marijuana cannot directly kill you, unlike alcohol. And \nalthough I have not personally driven stoned, many of my friends do so on a regular basis and have never once encountered any problems. Marijuana is a social drug, just like alcohol. My best friendships have been born from a common interest: smoking pot. All of us are attending major universities of repute, all of us excel in athletics or \nacademics, and none of us have ever been imprisoned or reprimanded for any sort of misbehavior. Marijuana, in moderate amounts, would be great for American society. We \nall need to loosen up a bit.\n\n\nPot should be legal.  In small amounts it would only be used for personal use and without the distribution of it what is wrong with getting a little high once in a while.  The affects of getting drunk lead to violence, rape, impaired vision, and numerous other life threatening situations.  Getting high leads to increaded eating, laziness, and dare i say to much video game playing, i have never heard of the guy who smoked to much then went home and beat his wife, stole the car and then consequentely crashed it into the tree a block from his house.  It is one of the sadest realities of our country.  We will legalize alcohol and cigarettes which both have proven mental and physical health effects far worse than that of pot, but we wont legalize the weed.  IT is a flurishing underground market that needs to become mainstream.  If regulated and controlled properly, the marijuana industry could revolutionize the american trade market with numerous other countries.\n\n\nUm \nI’m all for it \nI mean ah \nLet’s see \nFor medicinal purposes I don’t really know what the medical value is of it but um \nI know from experience what pot does in that I’m for it \nUm \nI think in small amounts that way it wouldn’t be used for like uh selling or you know any type of business or financing for any other types of drugs that could be more detrimental to society \nBut I don’t see pot as being as being too bad \n\nI mean uh \nCan you define small amounts please \n\nSure sure \nUm \nWell in terms of personal use if its staying inside your house and its not making its way into the rest of society \nUm \nOr you know uh \nAnd if you’re doing it \nI’m assuming the people are responsible with it and are not um \nAbusing it \nTaking small amounts lots of times so it kind of defeats the purpose of small amounts then its it seems fair to me \n\nWell \nUh \nI think that alcohol isn’t as mentally addicting as marijuana is but I think with pot its different because \nYou know because \nWell for me at least when I \nI can drink and the next day you don’t feel so well you don’t wanna drink \nBut when you smoke you don’t have that same type of hangover or effect \nIt’s like a \nIt’s almost like a less \nFor me I think it’s a less serious drug then alcohol \nUm \nAlthough \nI’m sorry what was the beginning of this question \nI kinda took off topic there \n\nOh ok \nUm \nNo then \nYeah no not regarding \nI’d say no \nI think its \nI think it effects different parts of your brain \nUh psychologically \n\nAnd then that in turn effects you physically differently \n\nWell \nI mean \nI think first of all people that buy in small amounts \nUh like grams and and dime bags nickel bags things of that nature are generally younger people \nPeople that uh that maybe starting off or um \nOr don’t really have a big time or a big dealer or something where they can pick up more more pot and in that regard um \nIf you legalize small amounts then maybe the people that will be starting off younger uh \nActually I don’t know if that’s a good thing now that I think about it \nMaybe that would be a bad thing maybe easier for young people to start off cause they’ll be able to find smaller amounts \nInteresting I didn’t think of it like that \nBut uh \nNo I think it’s uh \nI think with legalization of small amounts it could also take away from the big amounts that would be sold out there \n \nAnd it could also be a pretty lucrative industry if contained properly \nI mean the tobacco industry does a killing literally here in the United States and I think if regulated properly it would take away from a lot of \nUh crossing \nI mean from the North and South border uh problems \nThat’s \nDrugs are definitely one of the biggest issues with the borders which is a big issue in our country right now \n\nUm well \nSure \nI mean pot is \nIt it it does effect I think it’s like the thalamus or what is it whatever it is hypothalamus \nWhatever it messes with your brain \nIt’s a drug \nIt does lead to other drugs obviously \nI mean whether people admit it or not it is a gateway drug \n \nAnd I don’t think you want people doing other drugs \n\nUh \nNo \nNo not really \nI mean I think it \nI think no matter legal or not \nOr you know or unlegal or non legal whatever it is illegal \nUm \nYou know its gonna have its place in different age brackets and \nYou know societal roles in our country \nThat’s just the way it is \n\nUh \n\nUh well \nSee I’ve been smoking pot since I was in 10th grade and I stopped 4 days ago for the first time in a long time \n\nI’ve been actually clean minus the drug test I had to pass two years ago for a job \nUm which I did miraculously in 10 days \nSince a long time ago \n\nThat’s all \n\n\n\nTo pot?",
        "One of my big problems with marijuana being illegal is the complete hypocrisy of the fact that I am allowed to kill myself by smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol, or eating transfats, but I am not allowed to make the responsible, adult choice of smoking/eating/vaporizing marijuana. It is almost impossible to kill yourself by smoking pot as I'm sure we all know. Don't even get me started about the fact that marijuana doesn't cause the violent, aggressive behaviors that alcohol does.  Alcohol in general affects the mood more by jacking it up and then becoming a depressant.  The detrimental health effects from the smoke are much less than those from smoking cigarettes, but inhaling any smoke does cause problems. These problems can be minimized by eating or vaporizing though. I also think there is a major problem with it being classified the same as other drugs like cocaine, heroin, meth, etc. When kids are told that smoking pot will ruin their lives/make them crazy etc. and they realize that this doesn't happen, it illegitimizes the warning entirely, making it really easy to believe that since they were lied to about weed, then the adults must also be lying about the other drugs. It's really, really dangerous. The fact that its illegal also makes it somewhat easier for many kids to obtain than alcohol, since while many people would never sell to a child, many people don't care due to the profit potential. The illegality also creates so much unnecessary crime and violence that just wouldn't happen if it were legal. How many people sell their homebrewed moonshine for incredibly jacked up prices? Why not legitimize and tax its sale, using some of the tax money for real drug education and rehabilitation programs? The way it is now, our prisons are out of control and filled with nonviolent offenders and the only government money being made from marijuana is a result of corruption. And court fees and or fines.  By making it illegal, we also dramatically limit the amount of research that is done on its health and medical effects, whether they be positive or negative. Even though the federal law overrides the states that have medical marijuana programs, its still a positive step and I believe that if more states follow this trend, real results can happen. I'm not sure how I feel about the legalization of other drugs. I do think there are harmful drugs out there and of course there is a potential to abuse any substance really. I do know that what we are currently doing is NOT WORKING and that there are millions of lives ruined by both drug abuse-not marijuana-as well as the drug war's effects. The punishment should not exceed the crime, and in the case of marijuana, as well as some other drugs, this is certainly not the case.  The drug status of marijuana was in the very beginning yellow journalism.  William Randolph Hearst and other lumber heavy-hitters in the 20's gave hemp its \"evil\" makeover by redubbing it \"marijuana\" which gave it a foreign/exotic /unfamiliar/distrustful sound.\n\n\nSo what the country is trying to tell me is that I can kill myself with\ncigarettes alchohol and numerous other things but I am not allowed to\nsmoke pot? Killing yourself by merely ingesting marijuana is almost\nimpossible.  On top of this, pot does not have the physical addictablity\nthat alcohol or tobacco has.  Alcohol also can cause violent mood swings\nand aggressive behavior.  The worst that happens with marijuana is that\nyou mellow out and get a little hungry.  If the government were to\nlegalize and regulate marijuana they could first of all make money off of\nit.  There are taxes on alcohol and cigarettes that make the prices high,\nthe same could be done with pot.  Also it would take the danger  of the\ndrug being cut with something else by the dealer out of the equation. \nMarijuana could have massive medical implications, but due to its\nillegality we have no idea.  At the moment only some states allow\nmedicinal marijunana for terminal patients.  I think a big problem is the\nvillanization that has been attached to marijana as well.",
        "\tThe recent legalization of small amounts of marijuana to users 21 years and older has certainly sparked much debate.  I believe that its effects are similar enough that it should be made legal.  There have been numerous tests and studies performed to assess the consequences of marijuana smoking versus cigarette smoking, and the differences between the two are not that great.  When compared with alcohol both, in moderation, provide a very similar obstacle to the senses.  \n\tThe fact that marijuana has been made legalized in small amounts seems legitimate enough because most of the harmful effects, like many other drugs, have been proven to exist after long-term, frequent use.  The fact of the matter is that any of these drugs are not extremely life-threatening or detrimental to one’s mental development when used in moderation.  In moderation the effects are minimal and can be contained.  With marijuana, however, as with any drug such as alcohol and cigarettes the effects increase exponentially under frequent, long-term use.  \n\tThe decision to make marijuana legal in small amounts could also help lower the crime-rate and keep the money for the product in the city’s economy (as opposed to the black market).  When a desired product is made legal it cuts the amount of black market deals and crime associated with the product.  This is so because it is no longer illegal to perform the actions so the desire can still be fulfilled without the illegal attribution.  Of course there will still be crime associated with the use and selling of marijuana just because it was not completely legalized, but a percentage will be cut out as those occasional and moderate users can be satisfied legally.  \t\n\tRecognizing the relative safety of the drug in moderation, Denver can also make a positive economic boost.  Since the sale of the good became legalized, the government can now associate taxes with the good and sales may increase since there is a greater ease of acquiring the marijuana.  While taxes may hinder some from the purchase as opposed to the black market purchases, I think it would prove better for the majority of those in the market.  Even with taxes, the actual purchase is much easier, convenient, and without legal risk.  \n\tThe only problem I see from legalizing the marijuana in small amounts is how they are actually controlling the amounts being sold to customers.  One customer, as I understand the situation, could theoretically obtain a small amount from several different retailers making a rather large portion for that individual.  This would cause a problem as the idea of moderation is pushed aside and the marijuana can cause serious brain and respiratory problems in the long run.  \n\tOverall, I think the city got the age right by not likening the substance to cigarettes, but rather alcohol.  I think the effects are much closer to alcohol, even those some of the health side effects are repeated with cigarettes.  As far as mind alteration, it would seem that marijuana and alcohol are closer.  My educated guess of the average age for marijuana users in the United States is probably about 18, so with a higher legal age, the government is still giving this choice for moderation to those more responsible for the usage.  \n\n\n\nTo an extent, I believe the city of Denver is justified in its actions.  The legalization of marijuana, while not necessarily a positive for humans, is not the worst of negatives pertaining to human health.  Marijuana is not that far off from other drugs such as alochol and cigarettes in its effects.  When taken in moderation it is certainly equal to, if not less, harmful to humans than cigarettes.  Typically cigarette users smoke multiple cigarettes daily and this amount of intake of the various chemicals and carcinogens is far more dangerous than the occassional use of marijuana.  Marijuana is typically used less, most likely due to its more powerful effects in terms of pleasure as well as cost per unit.  The type of health effects from marijuana are also not that far off from those of alcohol, both in the short and long term.  The large difference between cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana is that society is used to marijuana being illegal and the other two not.  It does not seem right for it to be legalized because it is a change which does not come easy to humans.",
        "      Recently, the city of Denver, Colorado has decided to make it legal for people over 21 to purchase small amounts of marijuana.  Personally, I do not feel that this is a good idea.  I do not have very strong reasons to back up this view, but basically I feel that the government should not be making it easier for its citizens to use drugs.  While marijuana has not been shown to be addictive, it is still a drug that impairs the body.  Like any other drug or alcohol, marijuana is certainly a drug that can be abused or overused.  \n\tAlthough Denver might legalize marijuana only in small amounts, once the city allows people to purchase the drug, they can not control what people do with it.  The government can decide that only people over 21 can use the marijuana, but surely it will get into the hands of people under 21.  In this regard the situation is similar to alcohol:  while alcohol is only legal for consumption or purchase by people over 21, people under 21 find a way to get alcohol.  Although marijuana is not legal in the United States (other than in Denver), people still smoke.  Just because it is against the law does not stop people from finding ways to obtain the drug, but I don’t think that the government should make it even easier for people to get marijuana.\n\tIn the United States, we already have a huge problem with people drinking and driving.   So many lives have been lost because people drive under the influence of alcohol.  Even though the punishment for drinking and driving is significant, people still do it anyway.  We have a hard enough time keeping our roads safe from people who drive drunk.  It doesn’t make sense that we would legalize marijuana, since this would just provide another way in which people can impair their senses.  We will just have the problem of people driving under the influence of marijuana, which could be just as dangerous as driving under the influence of alcohol.  Obviously, just since marijuana is not legal doesn’t mean that the road are free from people who are high, but by making marijuana legal, we would just be increasing the risk that there would be people on the road who will be endangering the lives of others.  \n\tAnother reason why I do not think that it makes sense for the city of Denver to legalize marijuana is because it seems very strange to me that a drug would be legal in only one city.  I really don’t see how it will be possibly to control the distribution of the marijuana.  If we think that we have a problem with drug trafficking now, I believe that it would get even worse if we made it legal in once city.  At least when it is not legal at all, the rules are cut and dry.  But by allowing marijuana to be sold in Denver makes things much more complicated.  How do you control whether a shipment truly makes it to Denver or if it goes somewhere else instead?  This all just seems very complicated to me and much more trouble than it is worth.  \n\n\nI do not think that marijuana should be legalized.  I don't really have a good reason why, but I just don't like the idea of the government legalizing a way for people to get high.  I think that it is particularly strange that just one city, Denver, has legalized marijuana.  This makes things even trickier.  For example, it just seems weird to me that you would be allowed to smoke in Denver, but not in the next town over.  It's not even that marijuana is legal in the state of Colorado, but only in one city.  That is just weird to me.   And how can we be sure that we are keeping this under control?  How can the government regulate whether or not the marijuana is really being brought to Denver.  Let's say there is some shipment or something that was coming from Mexico and was headed for Denver.  What's to say that the marijuana isn't going to be brought elsewhere?  Like how can you guarantee that it will wind up in Denver.  On the other hand, when everyone goes to Denver to legally purchase marijuana, there is no guarantee that they will smoke it in Denver and not just bring it back to wherever they came from (where it is illegal).  We already face this sort of an issue with fireworks.  They are allowed in some states, but not in others.",
        "      When it comes to the legalization of marijuana, I have long felt and continue to feel that there is really no reason to continue this useless war against the drug.  Most of the anti-marijuana campaigns I have witnessed have few to no facts backing their claims and are more aimed at using emotional impact or bandwagon propaganda techniques in order to convince their viewers that smoking marijuana is an evil.  The latest anti-marijuana commercial I have seen is just a girl and her dog, and the dog complains to the girl that she’s not the same when she smokes.  This is perhaps the most ridiculous commercial I have ever seen.  Without a single fact or figure in the entire commercial, are we supposed to be moved by a talking dog?  A little critical thinking about this might provoke the idea that the reason commercials avoid using concrete evidence is because there isn’t any.  When the facts are really examined, this becomes more and more evident.  As far as long term effects go, there is little scientific proof linking marijuana with later health problems such as cancer, in fact the good marijuana does by healing patients of glaucoma and alleviating the symptoms of other diseases seems to contradict the evils of long term effects.  Besides, do long term effects really hold any say in today’s economy?  The evils of the tobacco and food industries do more harm than marijuana could ever do.\n\tSo it must be the short term effects that the anti-marijuana advocates have such a problem with.  However, how are the effects of marijuana any more severe than those of alcohol?   When taken in moderation, neither drug is particularly harmful.  When taken responsibly, neither one is a real danger.  However, when abused and taken in excess, the effects of marijuana are far less severe than alcohol.  An “overdose” of alcohol can lead to alcohol poisoning, blacking out, or ultimately death.  However, it is physically impossible to smoke enough to weed to overdose.  Besides, there’s a definite point where one really can’t smoke anymore.  In fact, there’s never been a documented death due to marijuana overdose.  The closest hospital trips due solely to marijuana are for dehydration, which shouldn’t even be a problem when the drug is taken responsibly.\n\tSo all that is left to examine really is the side effects of the drug, or rather everything surrounding the use of the drug, from what one might do while intoxicated, to the burgeoning drug culture surrounding marijuana.  As for actions taken while intoxicated, this is 100% correlated with the responsibility of the user.  If an intoxicated person decides to drive, this is no worse than drinking and driving, if not better.  But it is also still 100% the user’s decision to drive.  Sure, marijuana might impair one’s judgment, but it does not impair one’s sense of social responsibility.  If one decides to drive while intoxicated, they probably are missing the sense of responsibility not to drive intoxicated in the first place.  It is not the drug’s fault, but the fault of the driver.  This is why keeping the substance controlled and sold in moderation is a good idea.  It keeps the supply in the hands of legitimate business and out of the pockets of drug dealers, and while this may make the drug more easily available to those underage, it will effectively make the drug safer for use, limit the quantity available, and remove some of the mystique surrounding an illegal drug.  In effect, legalizing the drug will provoke users to be more responsible with it, as shown in cases in Europe, where the drug is legal in certain countries. \n\n\n\nMarijuana.  I'm gonna approach this topic a little differently then I\nnormally do and go ahead and say that marijuana should not be legalized. \nWhy is this?  Have I suddenly changed my mind and decided that marijuana\nis bad?  Absolutely not.  Marijuana is a great drug.  Probably safer than\ndrinking yourself to death, in fact.  The thing with marijuana is, I like\nthe fact that it's illegal.  It makes smoking more fun when you know that\nyou are breaking the law.  It's part of the drug's appeal.",
        "1. LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA:  The city of Denver has decided to legalize small amounts of marijuana for persons over 21.  How do you feel about this?  Do you feel that marijuana and its effects are similar enough to alcohol that it should be legal?\n\n\n\tI do not really know how I feel about the legalization of marijuana. On the one hand I have heard that studies have come out proving that alcohol is actually more harmful the pot. Under alcohol, one loosed much their inhibition and many a persons have made extremely bad judgment calls because of this. \n\tI know personally of friends who have blacked out, gotten sick, and have even had sex when they didn't mean to, all because of alcohol. I am not saying that this can not happen and does not happen with the use of weed, but I have not heard it to this extent. I also know that people can get addicted to alcohol if they are not careful, and can eventually get cirrhosis of the liver. This is a serious problem because then people have to have a liver replacement, which can take a long time to receive because of the weighting list. If they do not receive one soon enough, they death is the only other answer. Again, I have not heard of this happening with the use of marijuana, but I am not ruling it out, I have just never heard of it. \n\tI do know, that from when I have seen other people use it that they tend to act really goofy, or settle down and just sit there. I also know that just from talking with people over time that I am in contact with who do use it frequently, they do not seem to be as sharp as they used to be. I am not really sure if there has been any significant case study of this, but I feel that it tends to kill of brain cells. I would have to do more research though, before I came to any conclusions about the drug. \n\tOn a different lever outside of actually using it, I do feel that it should be legalized, because that way the government can monitor it. There are so many drug wars and gangs on the streets because of this drug, and there would be a lot less death in the inner cities because it would no longer be an underground market. Also, but regulating it, people would be sure to be getting the actual real pure substance, verses just filler or even poison mixed in with it. \n\tAnother reason why it should be legalized is because it would help to get rid of the drug war outside of the United States, namely Mexico. Mexico has some of the biggest and cruelest drug lords in all of the pot selling business. Marijuana is actually a big cash selling crop, and the drug lords monitor who grows it and how much of the crop is sold, so much so that if something is messed up along the way, of if they find someone growing it/and or selling it who should not be, then bloodshed it often the only answer. With the legalization of marijuana, these drug lords would loose a huge part of their business, because we would be able to grow the crop on our own soil, and it would no longer be illegal, so many of the workers in Mexico for the drug lords would loose their jobs. There would be no need for smugglers anymore. \n\tSo again, for these reason I am not sure if pot should be legalized or not. \n\n\n\n   I do belive that marijuana should be legalized because it is actually\nnot as harmful as alcohol and can actually be regulated better by the\ngovernment if it is legalized.\n  I actually read somewhere that marijuana is one of the bigest cash crops\nof the usa, however, it is not regulated when it is sold to second or\nthird parties so the \"drug\" could be unpure and thus this is ofthen why\npeople tend to dye from it. Also, if the government was able to hone in\non this big cash crop we would be making a lot of money and help get our\ngovernment out of debt and lower the deficite.\n  If it was leagalized then there would be less drug related murders and\nwars as well. Mexico is one of the biggest problems that we face as the\nusa. They have many mobs down in SOuth America and thier only crop is\nmarijauna, and they will do anything to make a sale before the other\nmobs do.",
        "\tMarijuana costs our legal system a great amount of money every year, yet has a tremendous potential to adversely affect those who use it.  It is indubitable that users of the drug can experience adverse effects in a number of ways.  It is harmful to the respiratory system, depositing tar and toxins in the lungs similarly to cigarettes.  In the first half of this century, there was a big push by a small group of people to create a state of “marijuana prohibition”, the push was successful, and we still have it in the majority of America today.\n\tMaybe in the end, marijuana prohibition is a good thing, because it prevents a “national overload” of usage.  For instance, it wouldn’t be good for everyone to be driving cars high all the time, we’d probably see a lot more accidents and traffic problems.  However, laws obviously don’t stop teenagers and adults alike from attaining and smoking marijuana.\n\tSo I guess the question we must be asking is “do the costs of prohibition outweigh its benefits?”.  The biggest benefit of marijuana prohibition is that it satisfies the majority of Americans who have a moral objection to smoking marijuana.  It keeps these people happy, as many of them say “if we repealed marijuana prohibition, our entire country would go down the moral toilet!” (as if it hasn’t already).\n\tHowever, keeping marijuana illegal is very costly.  Every time police arrest someone for smoking or possessing marijuana, there is a lot of state resources that must be expended to transport, detain, book, charge, and sentence that person.  Court fees, police fees, probate fees, and the like end up draining state coiffeurs of money that could better be spent somewhere else.\n\tBut honestly, I’m not sure that the money freed up by making marijuana decriminalized would really achieve any benefit which outweighs that of marijuana prohibition.  If we legalize marijuana fully, we will probably see an explosion in usage which will be nothing but detrimental for us as a country.  I know people who smoke marijuana and they are entirely debilitated when they do it.  I certainly wouldn’t want to live in a world where everyone is high all the time.\n\tThe city of Denver didn’t exactly legalize small amounts of marijuana for persons over 21, it “decriminalized” them.  This might be a good middle ground – we can still keep marijuana illegal, only it will be more of a citation than a full criminal charge.  My understanding is that, with decriminalization, possession of marijuana will be more like a speeding ticket than a criminal charge.  This would probably be a good middle ground, as we could keep marijuana under control, but not have to pay the costly fees that go along with marijuana being entirely illegal.\n\tAlso, if I were dying of cancer, I’d probably try marijuana, because chemotherapy probably sucks.\n\tHonestly, I don’t know the answer to this question; marijuana has never really been something that affected me directly, so I’m not sure what the best course of action is.  I trust our legislature to find the appropriate remedy to the marijuana problem.\n\n\nI have written about this topic twice already, chatted about it online,\nparticipated in group discussions, and recorded a telephone \"monologue\"\nabout it.  I'm probably going to restate almost exactly what I've already\nwritten at least four times.\n\nOkay, so the moral implications of legalizing (or even wide-spread\ndecriminalization) marijuana aren't really something the US is ready to\ndeal with.  I feel like the illegality of marijuana contributes to its\nnovelty in the eyes of adolescents and teenagers, and if it were to all of\na sudden become legal, they simply wouldn't be able to handle themselves. \nThere would be no sense of moderation, there would just be a \"wahoo! pot\nis legal!\" craze in middle schools and high schools across the nation. \nThis wouldn't be good for anyone.\n\nHowever, conversely, the illegality of marijuana costs a great deal to\nfederal, state, and municipal legal systems each year.",
        "      There is much controversy surrounding the issue of the legalization of marijuana.  The drug is known to have medicinal benefits, and it is legal in many other countries.  At the same time, it also leads users towards more harmful drugs.  Clearly, marijuana is illegal for a reason, and any decision to legalize it would be unwise and would endanger the health and safety of many people.  The current state, in which marijuana is illegal, is ideal and should be upheld firmly.\n\tMarijuana is commonly known as the gateway drug.  Many users begin drug use with marijuana, and go on to use more harmful drugs, such as heroin or ecstasy.  Marijuana is a mind and personality altering drug, with short term as well as long term effects, few of which can be deemed positive.  It is not only easy to transition from marijuana to more serious drugs, but it is easy to become addicted.  Drug addiction is nothing to be taken lightly, and legalizing marijuana, even in small quantities, would only add to this problem.  It is ambiguous to legalize “small amount of marijuana” and also probably very difficult to enforce.  It is much simpler and safer to keep marijuana illegal and not forget its mind-altering qualities and unpleasant behaviors associated with its use. \n\tDespite the clearly negative effects of marijuana use, many people wish to legalize it either for its medicinal benefits or because its effects seem similar to those of alcohol.  To those who claim that the health benefits outweigh the detriments, their argument might be worthy were it not for the addictive nature of marijuana.  A small dose of marijuana might be helpful in treating certain medical conditions, but such a treatment would also place the patient within the grasp of a lifelong substance addiction.  Depending on the necessity and frequency of marijuana treatments, patients could theoretically wind up cured of an ailment, but ripe for the development of an even more serious drug problem.  It is far better to use other treatments and keep the number of people with drug problems down to the bare minimum.\n\tThe effects of marijuana may seem no more severe than those of alcohol that it should be an illegal substance while alcohol is legal.  The effects of marijuana, however, are significantly more serious than those of alcohol.  The main reason for this is again, that marijuana is the gateway drug.  Alcohol use can lead to alcoholism, an addiction to one particular substance, but marijuana use can often lead to a myriad of drug addiction problems.  Society is familiar with the abusive relationships that can result from alcoholism, and it would not be wise to increase the amount of poor behavior by creating more people who are dependent upon a substance.  It is important that the serious effects of marijuana use not be downplayed in an attempt to justify its legalization.\n\tOverall, marijuana use had many problems associated with it that would only escalate if the drug became more prominent through its legalization.  The best policy regarding marijuana is to maintain the current no tolerance policy for this harmful drug, rather than try to find reasons justifying its legalization.\n\n\nI think the legalization of marijuana would be an unwise decision.  Marijuana is a harmful, addictive drug that even if used in small quantities can cause many health problems.  Most importantly, marijuana is the gateway drug to more serious, dangerous drugs.  Most people who use illegal substances use them as a result of their previous marijuana.  Legalizing marijuana would only put more people in the downward spiral of addiction by making the drug more easily available.  Marijuana is much more addictive than alcohol and leads to other drug use, unlike alcohol, so it is reasonable for alcohol to be legal and marijuana to be illegal.  One of the main problems in enforcing a law like the one in Denver is limiting the legal quantity of marijuana and defining small.  Overall, it would be best to keep marijuana illegal and avoid the problems associated with this harmful drug.\n\n\nI don’t think that’s a good idea \nBecause \nMarijuana is illegal for a reason \nIt affects the way you think \nAnd the person that you are \nAnd it has some very negative lasting side effects \nWell \nEffects \nI guess you would say \nThat \nAre undesirable \nWhich is why it’s illegal \nIt’s addictive \nAnd \nMost importantly \nI would say \nIt’s the gateway drug to other drugs \nPeople think marijuana is totally harmless \nAnd it might not be the worst of the drugs that you could do \nBut it definitely has \nUm \nProblems associated with it \nAnd \nThe biggest of those problems is that it can lead you \nTo do other drugs that could be even more harmful \nAnd \nJust lead to overdose \nDeath \nSo many bad things can happen as a result of drug use \nAnd \nUm \nBy legalizing it \nThat would only be encouraging that kind of behavior \n\nNo \nI don’t think so \nUm \nAlcohol also has negative effects \nBut \nMarijuana’s effects are so much more amplified \nAnd \nAlcohol doesn’t necessarily lead you to \nTo abuse other substances \nUm \nUsually alcoholism happens by itself \nBut \nUm \nDrug addiction happens with multiple drugs \nSo \nMarijuana would be a problem because \nThey would get involved in many drugs \nAnd \nAlso \nThere’d be a problem with \nUm \nYou said legalizing small amounts of marijuana \nWell \nLike \nWhat’s a small amount of marijuana \nEven if you designate a specific amount \nLike \nThat \nThat just means there’s going to be marijuana \nMarijuana circulating a lot more \nAnd it’s very easy to abuse a privilege like that \n\nUm \nWell \nAlcohol has negative effects \nBut marijuana has more negative effects \nI would say \nLike \nHow it affects your brain \nAnd personality \nAnd violent behaviors \nAnd \nLike \nAll kinds of \nNegative effects \nI don’t know particularly \nBut \nI guess \nMy main argument would be that \nIt’s illegal because it’s harmful \nAnd addictive \nAnd  \nUm \nIt shouldn’t be legalized \n\nNo \n\n\n\nThat is.",
        "      I feel fine about the legalization of marijuana for adults of age in Denver.  However, there should be no discussion about the effects being ‘similar’ to alcohol, as this is a flawed argument.  The reasons that someone should argue for the legalization of a drug such as marijuana should be based on research on the causes and effects – both positive and negative – of using the drug.  It would be perfectly acceptable for alcohol to be used as a control group:  alcohol is legal, so if the drug in question doesn’t produce any negative effects beyond that of alcohol then those results can be used as evidence to support its legalization.\n      On a more personal note, I always thought that alcohol produced far worse effects on a person’s environment then marijuana.  When was the last time you heard about domestic violence from a stoner father?  I’ve never heard of it.  Maybe the kid would come home, notice his dad’s rather sleepy, then become overjoyed as his father treats him out to some TGI Friday’s.  On the other hand, as a college student I’ve witnessed many examples of how someone doesn’t need to be an alcoholic to screw their life up.  Every weekend, multiple students get written up by their Resident Assistants for public intoxication or performing some idiotic activity while drunk, such as urinating on the side of a building.  During these times, where are the stoners?  Breaking and entering?  Carjacking people on North Charles Street? Robbing a liquor store?  None of the above, folks!  Basic logic tells you that with the amount of students at a college like Loyola, someone somewhere is taking hits from the bong, and they’re not even getting caught.  The reason for this is because laughing maniacally at reruns of South Park on Comedy Central while ordering from three different take out restaurants isn’t a crime.  The worst punishment for that would be a noise violation.\n      Of course, the legalization of marijuana isn’t something to be taken as a joke (in its entirety).  There are people who question where the drugs come from in the first place, or if the people they are buying from are supporting some terrorist organization.  With the federal legalization of marijuana, this problem would be eradicated.  Once someone gets a hold of some pot seeds, everybody and their brother would be cultivating their own stash.  As an added bonus, the new demand would probably create a whole new industry which in turn would create numerous jobs.  There have been rumors of cigarette producing companies such as Phillip Morris spending money researching how to go about marketing a marijuana cigarette, just in case the government decides to legalize it.  Even if that is just a rumor, it would be hard to imagine Big Business witness the birth of such a great moneymaking opportunity without capitalizing on it themselves. \n      After discussing all of the above points, it is important to note that marijuana will not be legalized federally at any point in the near future.  So, if you plan on smoking the reefer, you’d also better plan on hiding out in your comfortable living room eating deliciously greasy American food… but I don’t think that idea will bother you that much.\n\n\nI feel fine about Denver legalizing marijuana.  All the evidence I have seen points to a simple fact - when used in moderation and in an appropriate setting, marijuana does not hurt anyone.  Actually, the people who use it seem to have a blast!  Alcohol, which is legal for people over 21, causes people to get \"sloppy drunk\" and angry, resulting in bar fights and other idiotic displays of immaturity. People who get stoned just watch\nTV -  I don't even think they would have the energy to get in a fight. Most importantly, you can die of alcohol poisoning. Its physically impossible to overdose on marijuana - the amount you would need to consume is so large that the person would simply pass out before they could even get halfway.  Knowing all this, it seems pretty obvious that alcohol has worse effects than marijuana.  Since alcohol is legal, shouldn't marijuana be as well?\n\n\n\nUm \nI feel that it’s fine \nI really don’t understand why marijuana is looked at as such a taboo in the first place \nThe example I always use is that \nI mean \nWhen was the last time you heard of mari \nFather addicted to marijuana his son comes home \nAnd \nThere’s domestic abuse in the house \nLike \nI always joke around that the son would come home \nKind of realize his dad’s a little groggy \nAnd \nThen he’d get really happy when his dad treats him to TGI Friday’s\nThere’s nothing \nYou don’t hear \nYou hear about people like getting stoned and then doing ridiculous things \nWhich happens every week here \nI mean \nI look around \nAnd \nThere’s so many kids getting drunk \nAnd \nGetting written up in college for \nLike \nUrinating \nPublic urination on the wall \nOr \nLike getting in fights in hallways \nAnd \nJust really idiotic things that aren’t really thought through \nBrought on by alcohol \nBut \nI always get the feeling that \nJust from statistics someone here has to be smoking marijuana on a weekend \nAnd \nYou never hear anything about them \nExcept if there are other drunk kids in the room as well \nI mean \nThey do get written up \nBut \nNothing violent happens \nIt’s always just because of the fact that they have marijuana in their room \nIt’s like they just got caught for smoking marijuana \nAnd \nWhat negative effects could come from that \nI just don’t see any \nYeah \n\nYeah if they like \nThey’re just gonna get high \nAnd \nHang out \nAnd \nEat take out food \nAnd \nWatch the television \nI mean \nIt might not be my idea of a good night out \nBut \nWhatever they want to do float their boat \nIt doesn’t hurt anyone \nDoesn’t hurt themselves to any great extent \nUnless they decide to be immature \nWhich if anyone over twenty one hopefully they’re mature \nI mean they can drink alcohol \nI just don’t think the effects are any worse than alcohol \n\nWell no \nI don’t think it should be compared with alcohol in any certain sense \nIt should be \nLike \nYou have to take marijuana \nAnd \nLook at the cause and effects of just using marijuana \nI mean \nYou can use alcohol as a control group \nBecause \nAlcohol is legal to drink for people over twenty one \nSo \nYou can say in a sense that well the effects the negative effects of marijuana do not surpass the negative effects of alcohol \nAnd \nAlcohol is legal \nSo then \nTherefore why not make marijuana legal as well \n\nUm \nHmm \nI don’t know how to break that down \nLike \nUm \nIf someone \nI don’t know like \nIf you \nThey spend research time seeing between like how many car crashes \nI don’t know \nJust work with the statistics \nI really don’t know how to \nJust if they can like test marijuana users \nAnd \nSee what like the negative effects of using marijuana \nAnd \nRun all of the statistics \nOut of how many people that smoke marijuana how many will get this certain illness \nAnd \nYou can use that against like how many people will drink \nHow many people will get like liver disease \nAnd \nIf the negative effects of marijuana aren’t worse than alcohol \nAnd \nAlcohol is legal then that means marijuana should be legal too \n\nUh \nNope \n\n\n\nYes.",
        "\tAlthough marijuana is a drug, it is a lot less potent than most and in my opinion, a lot less dangerous. In all honesty, it would probably be a lot less expensive and less trouble just to legalize marijuana. I don’t think what Denver did was a bad idea at all because by legalizing the drug and putting standards on it, they are actually giving themselves more power and minimizing crime. I personally think that smoking anything is a disgusting habit, but marijuana is so widely already used that it is not really a going to make much of a difference I don’t think. If anything, it’ll take some of the glamour away from it. Just because drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes is legal does not mean everyone is going to go out and do it, it’s just an option. Also, using marijuana is a lot less dangerous than drinking alcohol. You can’t overdose and die by smoking too much marijuana, whereas with alcohol, you can overdose and die by drinking too much. In my experience, I find that alcohol has much more dangerous and inhibiting effects than marijuana does. Legalizing other drugs would be a bad idea because they can and often do end in fatality, but smoking marijuana has about the same health risks as smoking cigarettes minus the mild hallucinogenic effects. If marijuana were sold in controlled environments like alcohol is, it would greatly reduce crime, and make the drug safer because you would not have to worry about what it was laced with. It would have a standard price and unit it was sold in and this would eliminate the possibility of being cheated out of your money. This would give the government the same monitoring capabilities as is has with alcohol. Obviously, driving under the influence of marijuana should still be punished much like alcohol is, but it would be a lot harder to prove and detect unless an accident occurred because that would warrant probable cause to test the driver. Regardless of whether or not marijuana is legalized, it is still going to be smoked by a large population of the Americans, so the government might as well cut their losses and legalize it. I don’t think it could get any worse by doing so, so really what is there to lose at this point? The war against legalizing marijuana has gone nowhere, and this country is in far too deep to eliminate it all together. At this point, that would be impossible because someone will find some way to smuggle it in or grow it, and the harder it becomes to get, the more expensive it becomes, and the more appealing it is to market because of all the money involved. The only way to end the madness is for the government to control the entire market and by doing this they will put many criminals and drug dealers out of business. This also frees up space in jail for those who were incarcerated for possession of marijuana and allow the police to focus on more serious crimes. Overall, I think this is the best solution. \n\n\nConsidering that the effects of alcohol are potentially much more fatal than those of marijuana, it is not really doing any harm for the government to legalize it. People die from alcohol poisening all the time, but you've never heard of someone overdosing from smoking too much pot. In legalizing marijuana, the government will actually be able to have more control over it and prevent such things as users unknowingly buying the drug laced with other, more dangerous substances. It may also help to reduce drug related violence because there would be no conflicts over being on someone elses turf. Also, law enforcement could focus on more serious crimes, rather than arresting people for possessing a drug that is less lethal than alcohol. Not only is marijuana less lethal the alcohol, it is less lethal than many perscription drugs. At this point, it is doing more harm to make marijuana illegal than it is to legalize it and people will smoke it regardless, so the goverment might as well get control over it.\n\n\nUm \nI feel \nI feel as though it was a good idea \nUm \nMarijuana is one of the most widely used drugs as it is \nAnd \nUm \nI think that by legalizing it the government would have more control over it \nAnd \nIt would prevent \nUm \nA lot of crime \nAnd \nIt would free jails up of people who are in jail for possession of marijuana \nWhich is kind of a ridiculous thing to send people to jail for \nBecause \nIt’s no more potent than like alcohol \nSo \n\nUm \nYes \nBecause \nI mean you’ve never heard of anybody overdosing on too much marijuana \nAnd \nPeople die from alcohol poisoning \nOr \nAlcohol related accidents all the time \nAnd \nUm \nIt pretty much \nIt does \nI think alcohol might even be worse than marijuana in its effects \nSo \nI feel that by legal \nIf you were gonna legalize alcohol the I think legalizing marijuana would be good \nOK too \n\nUm \nJust \nBecause \nLike \nThere’s so many diseases related to alcohol \nSo many people addicted to alcohol \nUm \nSo many people have died from alcohol \nLike \nNobody’s died from smoking too much marijuana \nYeah there’s lung cancer \nBut \nYou get lung cancer from smoking cigarettes \nAnd \nThat’s legal also \nSo \nUm \nIf \nSince marijuana just seems to be a lot less dangerous drug than alcohol then I think that it should be legalized \n\nUh \nNo \n\n\n\nIn case your parents are listening.",
        "      The legalization of marijuana never used to be a constant debate in my mind. I was once a person who had a set mind against drugs of any type. The reason for this stubbornness, I have come to realize, is that I was ignorant in the field of drugs. All of public schools make blatant attempts to turn students away from any type of drugs and/or alcohol. Coming from a traditionally Catholic family, my parents were also against the use of these substances. Once I entered high school, I obtained friends who turned out to be “Pot Heads.” I realized when I met some of these people that they were some of the nicest persons that I had ever met. My biased stereotype on “stoners” was that if they used drugs, they were bad people. Meeting these nice people who happened to smoke marijuana finally allowed me to realize that using drugs did not necessarily make someone a bad person. Meeting my friends who smoked marijuana has forever changed my opinion to the view that “pot” should be legalized in the United States.\n\n\tIt has come to my attention recently that Denver, Colorado, has legalized “small amounts of marijuana.” If the national law is that marijuana is illegal, then I believe that it should not be legal within the Denver city limits. There is already a huge underground market for marijuana, and the government has no control over it. If the U.S. government would make the drug legal for the entire country to use, people would not be smoking joints laced with cocaine, etc. The government would be helping people if they would take control of this issue. Since the under ground marijuana market is big in the United States, it displays how little control the government can have over its people. If the legalization of marijuana occurred within the United States, then the government would more-so be able to display its authority over people by destroying pot’s black market and protecting its citizens from “hard” drugs.\n\n\tMarijuana is such a common drug that some people do not even consider it a “drug.” I personally have never smoked “pot,” but marijuana is not a bad thing- especially if the government would come to be in charge of its distribution. Pot calms down its users and affects their responsiveness. This does not hurt anyone, but instead makes them happy for the most part. If the drug is not legalized, then the black market money will go to things such as the distribution of even worse drugs, such as cocaine, etc. If the U.S. government would legalize pot, then the profits or tax on the drug could go to building schools, homeless shelters, etc. It is currently easy enough to buy marijuana to the point where if I wanted to, I could find a way to buy it right now. Most countries in the world do not care if their citizens smoke pot because they feel as though it is a personal choice. The U.S., however, is arresting teenagers because the kids are doing something to their own body to have some fun.\n\n      Previous presidents such as Bill Clinton have tried marijuana, so why can our citizens not? If one drives their car while high, they will most likely be going at a slow rate. This is better than driving drunk, because a drunk driver could do more damage at higher speeds. I believe that “weed” should be treated as an equal of alcohol. If the government’s job is to keep its citizens safe, then why is it that they are allowing drug money to go to waste due to not legalizing pot? This money is going to guns instead of people. Marijuana is not a bad thing, and the U.S. government should join the rest of the world in legalizing it.\n#29\n\n\n\nI think that marijuana should be legalized not only in Denver but in all of the United States. Most  people who would want marijuana to be legalized are \"pot heads,\" but I can honestly say that I have never smoked pot. Almost anyone who has smoked pot before would not be against its legalization. To state the opposite, most people who never want it legalized most likely have never even tried it before. I believe that the people who don't want marijuana legalized are afraid of the drug and its affects on its users. I actually think that the affects aren't bad at all. If you look at what it does to you, then I would be surprised if you would still dislike the drug with a passion.",
        "The city of Denver has decided to make small amounts of marijuana legal. I do not think that this is a good idea at all. Who is to say what amount is a small amount? What is a large amount? There is no way that people can agree on how much is a small amount. If you are going to legalize the drug then legalize the drug in its entirety. Do not do it half way. There is no reason for it. Studies have shown that this drug is not only harmful to your body, but, it is also the gateway drug to more intense drugs such as cocaine, ecstasy and heroine. This drug is meant to give you a high, or a good feeling. Other drugs such as alcohol are meant to do the same thing and that is illegal for people under the age of twenty one. If they wanted to legalize it, I guess it would be more practical to set and age limit which is much more clear to the public than “a small amount.” The only problem with this would be, who decides what age is appropriate to make this decision? Should it be the same as alcohol? These are all questions that people must find a clear cut answer to before anything is finalized. Children, younger and younger each year, are experimenting with marijuana and for most, it leads to other drug use. These other drugs are illegal so why legalize something that has been proven to lead people to the use or experimentation with them? If they United States plans on legalizing a small amount of marijuana they should just make it all legal. Sometimes, it is the fact that it is so wrong and against some law that makes rebellious children experiment. They get such an adrenaline rush from the fact that it is not allowed. I do not agree with the use of this drug, however, if it were legal, and almost a norm, I think less people would be inclined to do it. Then it could also be taxed and more expensive which will turn people, especially kids, away from it. A friend of mine who uses marijuana somewhat often says that that is one of the big reasons for why he got started. He does not regret it, but, he said that the thrill of going against what your parents and society told you to do gave him such a high. He loved making decisions on his own instead of abiding by what was drilled into his head since he was a small child. He has nothing but good things to say about marijuana. It’s strange. Out of all of my friends, marijuana users and non  marijuana users, he has the highest average in school, has a job, and does service learning. He also plays lacrosse, soccer, and basketball. This can only make you wonder if the drug really is as harmful as they say. I guess we will just have to do more research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel that the legaliation of marijuana in Denver based on the amount is\nnot such a good idea. I believe that this drug is similar to alcohol in\nthat it gives you a high and impairs your judgement. I think that if they\nwere to even think about the legaliation, they should base it on an age\nrequirement like they do for alcohol. I have recently read that marijuana\nhas not yet been proven to be extremely harmful to the body if it is done\nevery so often, not on a day to day basis. However, it has been proven to\nbe a \"gateway drug\" to more intense, powerful, harmful drugs such as\nheroine and cocaine. I think that they should legalize it because it would\nallow the authorities to focus on more important things and I feel like\nless people would be compelled to do it because it would no longer be a\nthrill. From most people that I have talked to who smoke marijuana, they\nonly started because of the aderenaline rush that they got from doing it\nbecause it was illegal. Maybe legalizing it would, in the long run, help.\nI do not think it is fair for someone to judge what is a large amount and\nwhat is a small amount, that amount will differ from person to person.\nAge, however, is more of a concrete law.\n\n\n\nUm \nDid they say it’s over 21?\nOk \nUm \nI \nI don’t \nI’m really not sure how I feel about this \nThe only thing that I can really say for sure is that if they’re gonna legalize it for \nAnd like put an age in there \nI don’t see why they should distinguish between amounts \nLike what’s legal and what’s not \nI don’t know who is like \nWho really has the authority or knowledge to know what’s a small and what’s a large amount \nUm \nHmm \nI think that would be just an ongoing debate forever \nI think if they wanted to legalize \nThen legalize it for people over 21 just like they alcohol \nAnd they just have to leave it up to the person to know what’s a small amount and what’s a big amount \nSo um \nI’m not really sure about that \nI don’t agree with the use of marijuana to begin with \nBut um \nI think if it \nIt’s almost like in Amsterdam where it’s all legal \nLike I feel like it might even be beneficial if we legalize it to some extent \nEspecially for people over 21 \nBecause I think kids \nLike younger kids in their teens and whatever who are just experimenting with it \nI feel that one of the big reasons why they do is because that it’s illegal and because they’re not supposed to do it and they’re going against what their parents and teachers have been drilling into their heads for years \nLike don’t do this, don’t do this \nSo I feel like it’s just an \nLike almost an adrenaline rush \nLike it’s not even the high that they get of it \nI think it’s just the sneaking around doing it \nThat’s where they like get their high off of \nSo I feel like if there was an age limit and it was somewhat legal \nIn a sense I don’t think that it would be as popular as a drug \nAnd like I said like in my essay, it’s not like \nIt’s not like this drug is proven to be like that harmful for you \nIt is over time \nBut I mean it’s more of a gateway drug to like you know more intense drugs like cocaine and stuff \nI think if we do legalize it and people start using it less \nThere’s less of a chance that people will go on to use like more hardcore drugs I guess you could say \nSo I think it has it’s you know \nPositives and negatives \nBut I mean I think it’s just going to be an ongoing debate \nI do \nI think they pretty much do the same thing and alcohol \nI mean it’s not really \nIt’s not gonna kill you if you do it once and you do it at a responsible \nYou know \nYou just drink enough \nNot \nYou don’t overdo it \nUm \nI think marijuana’s the same way \nI think if you use both substances a lot it could be a problem \nBut if you use it in moderation \nI don’t think it’s that bad for you \nAnd I don’t know \nI have \nI mean I have friends that do it and they’re some of the smartest people I know \nSo that makes me \nIt just makes you wonder like is it really that harmful?"
