me too 

yeah me too 

i don't understand why marijuana was illegalized in the first place 

theres no reason it should be any more controversial than alcohol 

alcohol is ten times worse for you, and more dangerous to society

so what would go wrong if they made it legal? 

no one has ever died from smoking marijuana 

thats a fact 

not one person 

plus if it were legal and we could buy it in stores, like alcohol, that would reduce the amount of drug-related crime 

yeah, so people dont go killing each other over bad drug deals

well theres other drugs to be sold 

but it would minimize them 

if we could grow it on american farms, it would also end up creating more jobs and more income for farmers 

the US would never do anything to help south america 

i dont think they would benefit at all 
thats how they would see it 

its not like they have tons of oil or something 

we are yet to have one administration that actually cares about the people in other countries 

lol exactly 

yeah i was going to say 

lol 

yea weed is weed 

thats not even proven though 

its not yet proven to have longterm affects 

its completely different than cigarettes and alcohol 

how so?

its just like laws against drunk driving 

and being high in public can be made illegal, just like being drunk in public 

or just losers 

kidding 

but seriously, if they made heroine legal would people start doing it? 

i doubt it 

lol

oo 

but if people decide to smoke if it becomes legal, just because its legal, isnt that fine? 

Lol

i wana refer to what someone said before 

people that were scared to some it because it was illegal 

why would this be a problem?

if it were legal, who cares if more people start using marijuana? 

i think some are 

yea that too 

it might also just take the thrill away from people who like it because it IS illegal 

you cant get addicted to marijuana 

u can mentally get addicted to anything tho 

just like any habit, or doing anything u like more than once 

ive never heard of withdrawal from marijuana 

u can quit any time u want 

it does nothing 

u dont become dependent on it

thats heroine again 

thats them tho 

o thanks 

i apologize 

i just dont like hearing people make up stuff when they base nothing on factual evidence 

lol
