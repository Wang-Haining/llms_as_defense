Lol

Personally, I would like to know the reasons against priests getting married.

I understand that they have a commitment to their parish, but what other reasons are there

Then again, the Church is facing a decline of men entering the seminary. 

Do you think it might become necessary for them to allow priests to marry under these circumstances 

Right, but do you think that the Church would get to a point where it became necessary to allow marriage among the religious. 

It could also depend on the successive popes.

well, consistency is good 

but some church practices simply get outdated 

The Church is a fixed entity in that it serves the purpose of guiding people in their faith lives.

How it does that is subject to change. 

At least, that's how I would understand it. 

And again, that a priest is meant to serve God wholeheartedly.

In the Catholic Church, aren't deacons allowed to get married? 

Ah, ok.

Greater responsibility? 

Good question. 

that's virginity, not celibacy, right? 

celibacy is abstaining from sex 

chastity is living appropriately 

Married couples are supposed to be chaste, but are still allowed to have sex

Hope that makes sense. 

or they would be lying 

Again, going back to the shortage of men in the seminary, it's possible that it might become necessary to allow women into the priesthood. 

Personally, I'm for it. 

Do you know what the process is? 

I didn't know that

Right

Makes sense. 

that wouldn't make sense to me 
Agreed. 

In that respect, I like to think I'm a "modified" Catholic. 

lol, well, I don't agree with everything that's out there because it seems like, at least some of it, is subject to change 

Is it that, ideally, the Church should be free from error?

"Should" 

but in reality, that's not always the case 

Right.

No, I think it's more of a personal call than anything else. 

Okay.

I'm good.
