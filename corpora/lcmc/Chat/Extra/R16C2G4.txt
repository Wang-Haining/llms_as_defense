yea unacceptable

lol

wow 

theyre just homophobes when you get right down to it 

lol

its pretty bad how gays get treated in america 

alot of them feel like theyre not accepted already, and now the govt is just making it 10 times worse 

they always argue how it isnt natural 

its a somewhat valid argument, but it still shouldnt impede on peoples rights 

the govt is just people tho 

and there are alot of people who are against gay marriage 

they might not represent US, but they represent millions of people

its just sad that people feel so inclined to keep gays separate from heterosexuals 

separate but equal doesnt make anyone happy tho, does it? 

besides maybe the govt 

yea 
yea thats how i see it 

its hard to convince the whole bible belt over there along with plenty of other people that gay marriage should be allowed tho 

yea seriously 

if its not equal, then its discrimination 

do u think gay people want their marriage to be looked at as diff than a straight marriage

omg

that is not relevant at all 

lol 

lol

that would never be universally accepted 

human nature 

y not just call it marriage? 

it would be easier than anything to just let gays get married exactly the same 

no writing up any new rules or regulations 

just ignore the fact that people are gay or straight

religious views should not conflict with govt policy tho 

but thats not right 

people do not have to get married in a church 

i cant wait, i dont know about u guys 

yea thats a whole other point 

just like how 50 pct of marriages end in divorce 

where is the sanctity of marriage that anti-gay marriage people always talk about

the president and pals 

republicans 

say that gays cant marry because it would take away the sanctity of marriage 

yeaa took me a while 

oo lol 

no

wellll..... mostly republicans 

no gay marriage no abortion 

thats them 

maybe not 
but mostly 

lol

opposite

well it is the republicans afterall who have a REAL sense of morality

or those christian nutjobs we have running around the country 

exactly 

why?? 

cuz GOD SAID SO 

thats all they need to know 

more than likely

 ok well gay marriage 

yea

lol 

wut was that thing about the 16 states in the beginning?? 

o yea 

a step forward 

kidding

but that is just making it more known how much anti-gay marriage people are willing to do to prevent it 

lol

dramatic effect 

its just that u happen to agree with many things liberals agree on

yea 

i was wondering something about gay marriage the other day 

can gays who dont live in those states get married there? 

legally? 

yea thats what i was wondering 

if that is the case, then it seems like it is all about money after all

because if a gay couple from MD can get married in mass 

then still be considered married in MD 

they shouldnt, thats the problem 

its just that they wont receive monetary benefits from theyre home state

which must really be what anti-gay marriage people are concerned about
probably

but that is why it isnt legal in every state 

lol

but if straight married couple receive benefits, then gay should too 

but thats not govt related either 

just personal decisions made by bad fathers 

as they should 

what if his daughter was straight and he just didnt like her husband 

the father 

lol

its just one of those things i think 

no it implies both are feminine 

lol

the nsa is gunna love this 

seems gay enough to me 

that is also part of the whole controversy too 

i think 

well just from that, it hink it may be that people are anti-gay marriage because the whole idea just seems gross to some people 

that is a good last thought tho 

at least for 2 of us 

lol 

i love it
