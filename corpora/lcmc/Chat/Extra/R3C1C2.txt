i think back on my days and i feel that i have sinned more in an hour then God could ever forgive 

but priests are supposed to be our examples 

the idea of natural family planning and birth control/contraceptives NEEDS to be fixed 

but reality 

i thought that if you sinned in any way that you couldn't recieve communion

i thought it was all sins... 

swearing is a mortal sign right?

women have other roles that are e xtremely important and valuable in the church 

for a little while 

then it would be the same way it' always been 

i honestly don't believe it would change much 

yeah 

to me this is a backburner issue in the church 

yup

i personally would never participate directly or have an abortion, however i don't think it's my right to not let others not have them 

if you are not in the right health or can't afford a child, why risk it? 

huh? 

if they have 3 children and cant afford any more, then they should never have sex again? 

those surgerys are viewed as equally bad as condoms 

haha fair enough 

yes

they are a form of keeping pregnancies from happening 

exactly

yes there were some contraceptives bac k then

 i think we've covered all the big issues... 

or most of them

i feel as if there are much bigger issues
