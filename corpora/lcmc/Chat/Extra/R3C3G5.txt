it doesn't seem to effect the state at all if gay marriages were legal 

if anything it would benefit our government 

it seems so many people are for gay marriage 

true

it just makes them uncomfortable 

it's time that the united states recognizes the wants of this community of people 

agreed

i just can't think of any reason for not having gay marriages become legal

we're not saying the church has to chnage their ideas 

and to call it anythign other than a marriage is direspecting the community more 

huh? 

why what are jews policy? the same as catholic? 

yeah 

that's interesting 

well how can a christian religion allow it and not the united states? 

that seems ridicuolous 

i know 

about adoptiing children... 

i dont see any reason not to allow that either 

right

especially when we have children is the world who dont have homes

and if it is a proven fact that its biological or gentic why should they be kept from raising a child 

uhm what about the fact that it is being proven biological or genetic..

right and i dont believe that the church thinks he would jst do that

God i mean lol 

that is if it proven genetic 

yeah 

uhm

by and all knowing all loving God 

right 

or be alone essentially or chose a lifestyle seperate from what u want 

yeah

which should lead them to legalize marriage...bc i see no reason that would hold them back otherwise
