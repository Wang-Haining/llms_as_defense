thats what i thought 

Saddam posed absolutely no threat 

did we find any wmds? 

next year 

people are finally coming to their senses 

i say we just pull out 

we're not getting anywhere soon, and in the meantime US soldiers are dying for no good reason 

who cares? 

theyre poor tho 

where will they get weapons 

that was a completely different group of people who smashed the planes

yea

ok still 

if we spent our money on protecting the homefront in the US instead of on the war, wouldnt we be better off? 

yes give more money 

because there is not much at all now 
well thats pretty revealing, how rumsfeld said that 

or whoever it was 

i dont understand how the administration that got us into the war are not in jail 

there should be a huge investigation 

to just nail all those guys 

wut about bush tho? 

how about lying to the whole country 

"faulty intelligence" is obviously a cover up and a lie

wut would our enemies jump on? 

i cant predict the future, so i dont know 

yes 

and put in another president 

yes but they were funded by bin laden, who had tons of money

what is preventing them from forming now tho? 

of course it can happen 

im just saying that us being there is probably not preventing it from happening 

so we might as well pull out 
there are pros and cons to both 

we're guaranteed to lose americans while we're in iraq 

but we might lose them if we pull out 

if we could do that, we should 

obviously

ok, so... 

we havent found it yet 

what if a new administration cant find an answer tho? 

then we're just stuck there forever 

we have tried for 5 or so years 

i dont support any of those guys 

u have to realize that while we're waiting, we're just sending in more and more troops to be killed 

it just doesnt seem worth it to me 

lol 

i like this new topic better 

ok

probably

i just dont know wut 

so is it better to send in more troops now or just keep the ones there that are already there 

theyre getting pissed off at us, in other words 

right? 

lol 

all the more reason to pull out 

i kno 

im in shock 

lol 

wut does then? 

while we wait, they hate us more and more, as the polls provided by livingdeadbeat show 

we would have to find a way to keep track of their expenses, too

yes we could try to help them in other ways besides keeping a million soldiers there 

lol 

and they dont want that 

no one likes having others impose on them 

and so many american beliefs are based on christianity 

we should let them write up their own constitution 

i said "let", not "make”

im just glad we've come to a good solid agreement
