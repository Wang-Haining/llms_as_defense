but the stride is far from over 

well i think that there has been many strides in equality 

for women 

right

because men and women are different 

neither are better but as they are different it's hard to not feel tension at work over differences 

there are many people who will hate her as our president 

because she's a women 

there are still a notable amount of people (women and men) who think it's absurd that women have jobs and children 

maybe not a majority 

but those people are out there 

yup

right 

sometimes men can't get away with certain comments about women that women themselves can and do say 

i see that as a goodsign 

men finally understanding that a good wife doesn't mean she is simple at home

she she can be the earner and he can still be a respected part of the household 

where does that exsist? 

unequal pay i mean 

everything in a the job world should be equal 

the government can't chnage the way people think but this step of equalization would help 

agreed

they should 

as of now, there are still older generations who vocalize and teach their children that women have a place in this world that isn't in a job 

but i don't think equality is so far off 

agreed, some people won't change that 

that's not the only swear word that offends people 

but it's degrading and vulgar 

i know that much 

jerks are everywhere 

ok so what's going on?
