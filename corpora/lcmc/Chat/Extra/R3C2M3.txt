so are we supposed to discuss how we feel about the legalization? 

Ok

i agree 

there can't be such a varying idea on the matter 

if its effectively helping people i none state it should be helpign the poeple in all states

but it won't change use of it if they legalize it, obviously people will still find a way to get it 

i don't understand how alcohol can be legal and not marijuana 

legally or not, people will get their hands on it 

so why not legalize it for people who are dying and in need of it? 

Right

i mean it can't be ass legal as alcohol for example 

i think it should be legalized for meical use 

not so that everyone can feel free to get high everyday 

me to 

o 

considering that a large amount of people are already doing it

it wouldnt change much 

but what about the excessive amount of alcohol use 

whats the difference 

any college really, probably even adults 

can they and pass tests? 

drug i mean 

honestly im not sure how legalization would change anything 

i mean, it might get completely out of control nationwide, or it might become not so cool for people who smoke and it may die down a lot 

that's why they're afraid to change anything 

that's for sure 

most companies are happy as long as their emloyees perform 

right

huh?

yeah but people gop drunk to work and don't get caught 

right
