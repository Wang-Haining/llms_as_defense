I don't believe that the phone calls coming from common homes of Americans is how the United States is going to find terrorists. 

I just don't understand why they need our phone calls 

for what purpose

the only thing Loyola should care about is how we perform acedemically as far as i'm concerned 

fair enough 

but they would be 

it's a privacy 

the fact is that if you wanted something to be public you would say, show, or do it in front of everyone, but you don't. And that's for a reason

thank you 

i'm tryign to get through it quickly... 

what is the point of the link troy sent? 

thank you 

ok so the show infringes on the rights of the pervs and they get caught?

facebook also keeps everything you post too 

well if people are searching to find rapists on myspace then they aren't going to take every beer ridden photo and get those people in trouble too 

they don't have time to get everyone in trouble, at least I think 

i think once you are an adult, it's time to either delete or tone down your facebook or myspace profiles 

through extensive searches? 

i think jobs should provide a criteria of what they feel if appropriate for online display for the public and if not followed then they have reason for not hiring /firing 

if it has becme so important to companies 

i don't understand that 

do they have to search extensively 

companies i mean 

i mean if they have to search extremely hard to find incriminating things, then it shouldn't affect you gewttign a job at their company 

that's absurd
