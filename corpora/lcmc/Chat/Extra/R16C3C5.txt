the church doesnt care 

they should start giving out stickers to divorced people 

and in the meantime theyre just losing more and more churchgoers

yea

well thats all the church does 

wen it gets to god, though, the church doesnt matter anymore 

i feel like its not the churchs place to have any say in matters outside the church 

none

theyre local 

i dont see why not 

as long as they have to be celibate like men, wuts the difference

well the men cant have children either 

with women obviously 

i say we stick to the topic 

and the weak shall inherit the earth 

at least u admit it 

lol

human nature 

ok so women as priests 

its not like the male priests are gettin along so well 

its completely separate 

the church does not change its policies though 

well rarely anyway 

well theres a reason for everything 

i feel like the church just has no pressure on it to change 

it basically seems like a complete monarchy 

the pope says wut goes 

u have to realize its not a democracy 

thats all im saying 

not with the new pope 

no way 

then we'll get another old guy 

lol?
yes 

yes it seems more destructive than anything 

its not realistic 

condoms are 

but the church is not 

i know i dont 

i say we save all the sperm and make babie with it 

for food 

it would alleviate any starvation issues 

ok 

on topic!! 

next topic maybe? 

lol 

the pope 

wuut else would he do? 

hahahahaha 


well about contraceptives 

not really 

i guess 

but they dont have to preach to an audience every day 

well they cant marry 

yea well thats probably just to show how woman can get involved in the church 

lol
