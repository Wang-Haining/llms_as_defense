There's a problem you hit when people become "paranoid."

The F.B.I. showed up at a high school because of a comment a girl made on her myspace page

I don't remember when, but I read it in the newspaper a few months ago.

I don't recall reading a prompt. 

Oh, I haven't blogged yet. 

Ah

Right.

Well, how sure can anyone be that this information will be kept secure?

I'm not up to speed on general politics, so I don't think I could say anything for sure either way. 

I didn't know that. 

Even if you're just enrolled for one summer course, I was told that you could make a facebook account from a Loyola email address. 

Yeah, ignorance wouldn't be a good defence. 

Are we specifically discussing online privacy, or privacy in general.

Sorry, I got a phone call I had to take 

Ah. 
But then again, would that be grounds for new policies, like, routine locker inspections. 

And would that work, or would it cause more friction among students?

In your opinion, did it help? 

Ah, we never did at my school. 

Sometimes, it would be hard to establish such a cause. 

Especially in a high school environment, where kids may be more reluctant to speak up for whatever reason (social, avoiding embarrasment).

Or is it more general? 

Right.

That's true.
