Okay.

Anything specific about it? 

Could it be justified as a business decision? 

Or do you think that would just gloss over the truth

Ok. 

It is "discrimination" in that it isolates one group from another by making them preffered. 

preferred*

I wouldn't say that it's gone. 

Right.

But if we are making progress, are we moving fast enough to curb gender discrimination? 

Then again, is it even possible to completely get rid of any sort of discrimination?

I agree

In a broad sense, statistics might show a considerable difference between jobs among males and females. 

Perhaps.

If those are the circumstances, then yes, I agree

But it differs on a case by case basis 

A specific field, a specific employer, hiring requirements, qualifications. It would seem as though, at least in some instances, if a man was chosen over a woman for a position because of one of these reasons, it could be misinterpreted as discrimination. 

I suppose the reverse could hold true too. 

Ah.

Again, I think you would need to return to the specific circumstances. 

Hence, we have some controversy over affirmative action.

Exactly.

Statistics do show a wage gap between men and women.

A considerable one at that. 

The problem is aggravated even more because of a lack of uniformity among company/ business/ general policy. Say, you have a male doctor at a given hospital, and a female doctor at another. She could be paid less than him, yet not for the reason that she's female. One could simply be a busier place. It's context-dependent, and we would need to be careful as to where to assign "blame" for discrimination.

Sorry, took awhile to type. 
That could be true. How broad of a perspective you take could definitely affect that. 

Like, if you assessed a group of business in one city, any differences could be greatly exaggerated. 

Right.

Ideally, yes

Yeah, it does and you're correct. The only thing is that idealism doesn't exactly pan out in business situations. 

And how feasible would any such changes be? 

There's definitely some potential for progress towards a more "level" playing field. It seems like any change would have to be gradual, rather than "all at once."

It seems like that would be a smaller business, which would make it easier for them to get away with it. 

Again, you would need to return to the question of how feasible any sort of policy change would be. 

And how would you "enforce" it? 

That seems to be a classic problem. 

Ah. 

Alright.
