anything specific about it?

as in, should we pull out, or stay? 

i agre 

sorry

ah 

at some point, yes

right

oh, absolutely

sorry, misunderstood 

nor have i

but now that we're there, it doesn't make sense to abruptly just leave

wait, explain what you mean, Goldeneye 

lol no
