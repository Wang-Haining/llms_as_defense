I have a few friends that are gay, so I'm for gay marriage. 

Ah.

But would it stand to reason that they deserve the same civil benefits as a heterosexual couple? 

Probably not. 

So, are we now discussing whether or not being gay is a result of personal choice? 

I only asked because I wasn't sure of where everyone else stood. 

Isn't there someone coming to Loyola to give a talk about that?

Right, like the Greeks 

lol right

Has it already happened? 

Oh. 

It has a bit of both aspects. 

Well, among other things, the legal part involves insurance benefits, say if one spouse were to die. 

Right. 

Nope

Sounds reasonable. 

Ideally, yes. But, as we've seen here, there's a lot about it we don't understand, and without any experience, can only speculate about. 

If not, then let's go over the reasons that people would cite against gay marriage.

(in response to Goldeneye) 

the government? 

That would make sense. 

Do you mean the legal routes? 

Some also argue that there are certain environmental factors that contribute to a child's development of sexual identity. Given this, it might move this discussion beyond just genetics. 

As did I, but I've read (though I'm not sure I agree with it) that, say a male child grew up around women who tended to be unstable 

This disposes him to be more comfortable around men. 

Makes sense

What do you guys think about that? 

Some church groups do it though. 

I can't cite any specifically. 

A friend of mine was sent to a psychologist because he told his mom that he was gay. 

That's true, but to treat it as a sort of "Detox" implies that you think of it as some sort of disease to begin with, 

But you're right, it is necessary to make sure that something like that is for real. It's not exactly a decision to be made lightly. 

Right. 

Well, this might not be directly related, but there is some controversy over handicapped parents seeking to give birth to handicapped children. They then go to genetecists and have gotten it done. 

Could a gay couple do the same?
