that is absurd to send that many additional troops when we have already had far too many troops die and most of the country doesn't suport this war

ASAP

i agree 

it's ver ytrue 

i never bought that story 

i really always was against the war 

o my goodness he played the errorism up 

oil, pressure 

a maltitude of reasons 

none of the reason were valid 

definitely

i think that was somewhat involved

look how much our gas prices have changed since 9/11 


why?

it was an excuse to raise them 

i mena i'm mnot so sure 

but fair enough 

right 

honestly i think it needs to be brought to an end for the troops and many people's wlfare, but we're leaving the country to be more of a long term threat to us if we just up and leave 

help clean up? we removed a murderous dictator from power for them 

i mean we've done a lot to help 

and we can't up and leave 

but i'm just sick of feeling liek we're over there on an extending babysitting job

we have to think about the future of our country too 


and bush and his intelligence leaders shouldve thought of that when we started

we have soldiers over there who have no ideawhat they are even fighting for 

i sure as hell wouldnt 

well maybe thats why things are goign so poorly 

you enlist to be a part of a cause that meanssomething more valuable to your country 

i was 

my good friend went over 

he said the things i just mentioned 

he felt he was fighitng for sumthing that had changed, not against terroism and he felt left in the dark 

yeah 

somewhat gradual 

yes, b/c if we just leave the same problems will be there in 15 years again 

great example 

yeah its definately not for them 

i would just say that it's time for them to find some normal structure, whatever that may be 

and get out 

yeah 

things have just gone downhill severely 

i mnea is it going to effect anythign if we dont complete a certain amount
