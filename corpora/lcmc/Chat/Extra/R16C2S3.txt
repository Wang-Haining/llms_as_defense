yea that doesnt seem right 

kinda like affirmative action 

i dont know if it should really be the govts job to regulate business like this though 

its giving the edge to non-white men tho 

so its not equal 

yea they are 

but u cant try to force it like this 

i mean the govt shouldnt try to "force" equality by giving an edge to certain people 

its just a logical contradiction 

but people will always be curious whos running them 

in a perfect world yea 

i think maybe men and women are just not meant to be equal 

they tend to have talents in different areas 

superego?

so we're saying that this word, whatever it is, will always exist? 

yea thats just the easiest thing for the govt to do 
give out money 

exactly

they were supposed to fight for equality, a noble cause 

but they too often just sound bitter toward men 

good solution 

but in business

women still have power in certain businesses

theres the fashion business, the movie business 

well kind of the movie business 

lol

no it isnt 

thats not what i meant 

thats where men have the edge right now 

lol thank you 

making money 

lol

kidding

seriously

we did not make you 

thats a good point tho 

diff pay 

thats kinda hard to account for 

i honestly didnt know it was that common for this to happen 

ive heard it 

i usually chat about other things 

lol

but still, if this choice is up to the companies, theres nothing really that could be done about it 

yea what about chapter 1-10 

like grants 

that is fine tho 

but doesnt the company ultimately have a choice of whether to accept the govts offer or not? 

if they want me to do something for it that i dont want to do 

giving extra money to women-owned businesses is different tho 

thats the govt getting too involved 

yea they should be 

lol

im down with that 

nope

lol 

well im ready for gay
