Ah

i would say no, but many places have already legalized it 

well, some places have legalized it for recreational use 

if you're over 21 

we brought it up in our discussion group 

i know that arizona and california have done it for medicinal uses 

they did that in 96 

right, so lots of people are claiming that as a precedent 

to name a few 

ah, sorry 

so, are there still penalties 

ah, ok 

i didn't either 

i've heard that too 

though i'm not sure what a "legal amount" would be 

i don't think it should be 

health effects 
and it warps your judgment 

right, but it seems that alcohol has staying power because it's more traditionalized (assuming that's a word) than marijuana 

well, its more harmful than tobacco smoke 

don't people retain it in their lungs longer to get a better effect 

ok

do you think that legalizing marijuana would cause mor

overuse?

how feasible would it be? 

Ok

i think its possible 

but i think that some people would be trying to make the case for other drugs

i agree with that 

perhaps

im good
