i dont think its as prevalent a concern as racism 

from the traditional "nuclear family woman" to a more liberated one, which is good 

they exist 

well if both parents work but they want to have kids 

then one of them necessarily has to stay home right 

not necessarily the woman 

even if it ends up that way 

cops

they have to be 

me too! 

Well

we dont see active descrimination as much as we see the perpetuation of stereotypes 

turn on any tv channel, or look at any magazine, and you see hot chicks paraded like objects 

but you dont see men mostly naked spreading their legs in a bikini with a "bang me" look on their face 

i see it 

in every mens magazines, and TONS of womens ones too (especially teen ones) 

how many girly magazines have articles about crap like "how to please your man

i do 

im wearing one right now 

but all those magazines with "please your man" articles dont help the objectification 

they have an undertone of sexual subservience 

media is partially to blame for the "look a certain way" thing, but girls still buy into it themselves 

but the thing is 

sex sells! 

so for a magazine trying to make money at the expense of its readers intelligence, its a good marketing strategy 

howday

the man/woman paygap is still something like $1/.75 

well what about title IX 

what about places like hooters 

hooters is a perfectly g-rated family restauraunt that discriminates against men! 

Seriously

how is hooters degrading to women 

the place has a monstrous turnover rate though 

those girls put up with so much shit 

but they make so much money 

its pretty shitty that they are ding that for cash tho 

thats like one step away from stripper 

they shouldnt have to 

but thats the premise for the whole restauraunt and the whole job, so they do

yes 

she says its good money, i say shes an attention freak who has trouble differentiating between good and bad attention 

when i go to hooters i almost dont even want to talk to the waitress 

they do that whole sit down at the table and flirt with you thing

i pretty much want to go there for the wings, and dont want to bullshit with the waitresses 

im kind of uncomfortable around them anyways 

because their job is just so bizarre 

they are 

but i dont even want to deal with all the underlying issues of my conversation with them 

how did that work out for him 

i just want to say "jesus christ, ill give you a fucking tip, stop jumping rope"

in a way yes, but places like hooters probably arent going anywhere

hi melissa carbone 

how does melissa carbone feel about hooters 

*uncomfortable silence*

at loyola? 

i dont think theres gender discrimination as much as a shitty state of gender relations 

it is high school 

girls could be but choose not to 
i was JUST about to say that 

guys dont care 

girls dress up for other girls 

and they choose to wear that shit to the bar 

so they can hook up with some dude? 

okay that clothing that girls wear to the bar just makes dudes want to dive into their pants 

girls degrade themselves by wearing frilly mesh shirts in -5 degree weather with a short skirt 

it is 

dressing up in an essentially slutty outfit just makes dudes want to take advantage of you 

okay

so thats an example of a government program being taken advantage of 

or just "we want money, the government will dish out contracts to women owned business, so lets camo ourselves as one of those" 

i dont think thats sexism, its just crooked business practices

peace out fresca cola 

fresca is way better than sprite anyways 

:) :)peace out 

STAY ON TOPIC SHOOPDAWHOOP 

GRAP

GRAPEFRUIT /=/ WOMAN

okay so 

yes

no more than affirmative action is sexism against white people

ah yes 

sexism against white people 

you know what i mean 

racism against white people 

that govt contract thing for women owned businesses is an official aknowledgement of some kind of inequality 

as is affirmative action 

i dont think anyone can think of anything better 

its a huge cultural trend/problem though 
and its been around for thousands of years... so itll take a lot to change it 

awareness doesnt really fix things 

awareness is such a cliche term though 

everyone throws it around all the time 

yes, thats the paygap we were talking about a minute ago 

but still though 

across corporate america and what not 

no

the nurses part 

FOCKER

but the doctors part though? 

me too 

hehehehe

no shoopdawhoop 

active discrimination happens... but i think its really just an indicator of cultural things 

it should be personal choice 
ehh perhaps 

it should be personal choice
