so, who wants it legal? 

i agree with the legalization of marijuana 

sure youll have your share of big potheads, but then again, theres also a nice handful of alcoholics 

me neither 

just because they legalize it doesnt mean they have to sell it at gas stations

there could be an age restiction like in denver 

and also just like state stores they could have places where you could legally buy it if you were of age 

sure there would be kids having it bought for them, but come on, you go to loyola, think about the parallels to alcohol in that case

lifestyle problems caused by smoking too much 

because of its easily attainable nature with legalization 

i actually think that if you legalized it though it would become harder to obtain

because there would be fewer underground sources 

for SOME people 

for others its a recreational drug 

to be used on occasion 
one of my friends roommates smokes pot and i dont see any problems with him 

he smokes a lot of it 

hes in a couple of my classes 

yet he gets amazing grades 

if anything he has a bigger problem with world of warcraft than pot

pot doesnt exactly kill braincells 

its just the fact that youre holding smoke in your lungs that does it 

i read a study, i cant prove its credibility but i know more is being looked into that shows that pot can actually stimulate braincell growth 

in a good way 

im not saying you should 

but its interesting to see that come out as a result from one study

and there has not been one known case of lung cancer caused by marijuana smoke 

not saying it does no damage 

but its not as severe as cigarette smoke 

fewer chemicals 

i agree 
has everybody here heard the term "blunt ride" 

its when a group of kids will get together and roll a marijuana cigar/cigarette and ride in a car and smoke it 

now, how many fatal accidents have you heard caused by a blunt ride 

now lets make that a "vodka sprite ride" 

whole different story 

well i made that one up 

but it goes to show that the effects of marijuana arent as detremental as those of alcohol in terms of the "mess you up" sense 

immoral?

revolution!

i think that the whole issue of its morality will slowly fade

especially with a generation as tolerant as ours taking over soon 

while the introduction of marijuana into our economy wont be a speedy one, as we can already see by denvers example that it will happen

im not talking about within the next 2 years blue, im talking over a couple decades 

refer madness was a joke 

ive seen it 

and those were the same people who fell into this propaganda trap 

well according to refer madness and some of these politicians today it causes you to become an insane murderer 

nope 

none and there is pleanty of evidence against it 

maybe not written down, but im sure you all have seen movies such as dazed and confused 

its sad that they dont recognize that marijuana isn't nearly as big of a problem as alcohol 

george washington had hemp fields 

sure it is a useful material for clothing, but try telling that one to your narcotics officer 

if they found a hemp field in your backyard today youd be behind bars for the rest of your life 

he had been using some growing techniques that only aid with the THC content 

now why would he do that otherwise? 

several websites that ive attempted to research this at 

but thats besides the point 

im making a point that it was legal to grow it at one

just to answer the question if it ever was legal 

alright sooooo

i could say "taxation" 

thats what many government guys would give as a reason to oppose legalization 

but i dont think it would be that bad 

i wouldnt say similar, but id say they are on a much lower scale of "screwed you up

and depending on the intake 

but youll never get THC poisoning 

unless you smoke i think it is 2lbs or something 

but by that point youll probably have been knocked out 

alcohol poisoning poses an infinitely greater threat to a person than marijuana poisoning 

hahahahaha 

dear god, that made me laugh when i noticed it 

i dont do pot 

i know a lot of people who do though 

like my friends roommate who plays WOW 

mine was high earlier too 

and i didnt notice much of a difference 

i dont know, i think it heightens senses or something 

making food taste amazing 

yeah

people get the munchies when drunk too though 

but people when high dont throw it up 10 minutes later 

well maybe not you 

but ive known enough drunks that they do throw up their pizza valla 10 minutes after eating it

another advantage of marijuana over alcohol 

alcohol is a poison, marijuana just stimulates different parts of your brain 

okay so... 

that marijuana stuff

not really 

my roommate for one loves to smoke and do his reading for philosophy or politics 

alcohol

though i love it to death and will probably be visiting it at my friend murphs 

i doubt it 

some people would, but most wouldnt 

i think legalize with restrictions 

so is alcohol 

relatively speaking they're about the same price 

though i dont know from personal experience i know how much marijuana it takes to get "high" and i know the prices 

a couple of people can usually feel really good with a gram 

which from what ive heard costs around $20 

ive researched from my roommate and others 

for a couple people 

a good amount less for 1 person 

but compare that to a night at the bar and getting drunk 

or even a fifth of captain morgans 
a night in fells point can average between $40 to $60 

and then having your wallet stolen from some random guy who jumps out of the bushes 

just kidding 

did we all get 300

alright

economically i think marijuana would be beneficial 

tax that shizzat and the government will be rollin' high stakes

it would still be better than having a very large underground market for it 

depends on the person 

i doubt drunk people are very productive 

if anything they're more DESTRUCTIVE 

Columbia

depends on who the "big dealer" is 

ever seen blow? 

pot dealers who got caught* is what i meant 

people who have gardens of marijuana stashed in seceret caverns under their homes 

one of them got busted thanks to a flux in the electric bill 

i wouldnt say a lot, but enough to supply smaller dealers 

and then so on

moving down the ladder of dealers to the consumer 

in some parts of canada 

Amsterdam

in jamaica for rastafarians 

you sure? i havent heard of that 

i think you can buy it anywhere 

but you have to smoke it there 

in the cafes 

otherwise cannabis cup would be a big failure 

that attracts people from all over the world 

thats very true 

i think it would be better spent on other crimes 

which is not only tedious but expensive 

it doesnt solve any problems, it just creates criminals 

police are supposed to protect, not harass 

like a couple of kids seen in a smoke filled car 

haha seriously 

we get enough? 9:05
