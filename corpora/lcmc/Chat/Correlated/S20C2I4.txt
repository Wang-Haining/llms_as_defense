Yup

nobody likes bush 

lol

well, i think that we should still stay there, but i don't think that constantly throwing in troops will help 

yeah, he came at basically the worst time possible 

very true 

well it's not really us against everyone in the world i don't think

he world sucks 

lol

iunno about that 

originally, it was a great decision 

i just think that it kind of wore down 

going there in the first place, hell eyah 

you'd be saying the same thing if it was after 9/11 

that's all i was saying 

lol 

i think that's crap 

that's bullshit 

but there was already crap going on there with sadaam and the way he was running th country 

the terrors that he created were horrible 

if the U.S. started helping, maybe the rest of the world would catch on and help us.... 

but they suck 

lol

i don't really have a basis to form an opinion on that...the terrorists atacking... 

i think that guys should go first... 

not to offend you ladies 

man, i seem really sexist today 

lol

i would be honored to be drafted in all honesty 

jeez, i'd be happy to serve 

i'm never going to enlist because i have a lot going for me here at Loyola

but if i was forced to do it, then it wouldn't be as honorable as if i had enlisted in the first, place, but if it was at that point, then i know that the country needs my help- is the rationale 

yeah, i agree with you frogger 

i don't thinkt hat the draft should EVER be used in that sense...only in the case that we actually NEED it 

i wish i lived back then....:-( 

yeah

but on the other hand 

people coming back from Nam were like spit on and stuff 

so you can't say that they didn't like the war because they lvoed everybody over there 

the people protesting sucked a lot of the time 

yeah, that pisses me off 

yeah, but when those people who didnt' WANT to go came back, they were spit on and made fun of, etc

i don't feel like we do 

well, as much as we can 

i think that us saying how much we dont support the war makes them feel as though they are pointless over there 

seriously

i talked with a guy 

and he said that if we pulled out 

all of his friends, he and EVERYONE he knows in the army, would feel as though all of their friends have died in vain 

well neither did the U.S. when people came over here... 

it all needs to start some place 

and with us startin out, it sucked 

much like it does in Iraq now 

i didnt know anybody who died, just through other people 

so... 

do you guys think that if the U.S. pulled out now, that the Iraqis would form a better government than what they have now? 

(i don't think that it was irrational for the time) 

do you think that they'd be better off if the U.S was there ,or not? 

that's why i think we should stay there 
yeah, in response to the shiites and sunnies, that's too embedded in their culture...it's not gonna go away for God knows how long 

yeah 

I know some politicians want to pull out everybody right away

i'm not into supporting that, i agree with you gusy 

what do you guys think would happen if we did just pull everybody out all at once? 

say....hillary?......>:o) 

i hate that chik 

chick* 

lol 

but thats a different subject 

well in reference to our soldiers and hillary 

she didn't want to look at them at all in the white house 

did you guys know that? 

how degrading is that 

lol

thats effed up 

exactly

she couldn't look at their faces and apparently she had them look away from her (not exactly sure about the last part) 

but apparently it's true 

what do you guys think would happen with our troops and iraq if she was president? 

seriously 

yeah, we would 

but what do you think about what would happen with our troops?

who knows 

he may have a plan, but it's not really known to the public...well it's not...he just put in all of those troops

so i don't think he's planning to leave for a while yet 

totally

do you guys have any idea who'd be the best candidate for our policies over in iraq? 

me neither...wow...what has the youth of America come to?

lol 

his name rhymes with osama, so no 

lol, jk 

i know 

the cartoon writers will be in heaven 

that'll get really old really quick though 

obama vs. osama..... 

well, does anybody have a short topic to cover in around 3 minutes?

maybe a yes/no question with a short response?

meh?

baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad 

lol

i don't think dates exactly 

that's like scheduling your homework 

it doesn't always work out....but you work with the schedule you've got 

yeah, i'm totally for that 

and seeing goals accomplished will increase support in the U.S. with this pulling out plan 

if, thats' what we decide to do
