I feel that it is still present, but is working its way out in the present time period 

that was the question 

Ok...women discriminatioin 

Now that that is cleared up 

well not extremely prevalent 

I think it is working its way out 

More women in management positions in the workplace and better education about discrimination 

Thus costly 

They would hire the women 

Some employers have a policy of affirmative action 

Yup

if the same skill set is present 

they hire the minority 

We have a female secretary of state 

there is a female running for president 

only the second one in our 230 year history 

and besides, there have to be women running to vote for them

If you run, and are a decent canidate 

they will vote for you 

You can't just appoint women to the government, in this democratic society you have to vote them in, thus making them present on a ballot

well 50% of the population has to be women 

if they care that it is that much of an issue, they can vote her in

Because they aren't there to run 

Chile 

Women president 

If they do not respect women, then probably not

True enough 

What do you mean 

Where did your AP gov book get its information 

speculation? 

And every single man met that standard you presented 


Not pure fact 

signs of respect are not necessarily universal 

how can you place a fact on something subjective 

There are always going to be women discriminating men as well 

We have 

You think we have not addressed it at all? 

That is not necessarily due to discrimination 

I have seen studies where women do not prefer that major because of stereotypes set forth, such as being "geeky"

What? 

One you get into a school you can chose which field to study

There are more girls per campus, so why not just chose that major

It is individual choice, and they just are not chosing those majors 

So perhaps it shows weakness if you succumb to pressure

There are all sorts of pressures in our life 

If we back down everytime we meet a little pressure, we will never get where we want to 

How so? 

what consitutes biological strength, then?

Do you know what biology means? 

so then how does your definition of biological strength only support the idea of supporting another life 

You are also saying that is pure biological strength 

You are saying biological strength only deals with the ability to produce another life 

I disagree 

For both genders 

Certainly

I would imagine a smaller population for one 

can't afford a fully male army 

Point being 

Is it possible that any of them are men as well? 

No one here claimed is was not still a problem 

Does it show past data 

do you have a trend to show us 
We are addressing it via education in college's with emphasis on the topic as well as affirmative action hiring practices 

Have early dates 

going back into the 80s?

I think mentality can be changed 

You do not think so Janada? 

So Janada, can you clarify your point from before 

Right, it will not happen overnight, I agree with that, but I also believe we are in the process of getting rid of it, do you not? 

I see many sexist jokes against men as well 

There will always be those peopl 

People

but I think citing sexist jokes might be off the mark as that spreads to men as well 

Perhaps, but I would argue that mentality stays within their "clan" or family group 

I do not think that mentality would really bother either of you 

but I suppose if they were in a power position, I could see the affects you speak of 


The middle-eastern mentality 

Read what I just wrote 

Right, that's where I agree 

but I think that our system is trying to work on shaping leaders without that mentality 

and it will take time 

No

I am saying that if that person just has that mentality but has no power over you, it probably would not bother you 

Well, in a way that could hurt your progress 

if someone just came up to you and said you were not intelligent because you were a woman, would you really care? He is probably not intelligent to even make such a problem and such a statement can not hurt you

Well perhaps this is another gender difference 

I would not let comments like that impede my progress or take it to heart

Why would it bother you 

Who cares 

as long as he holds no power over you 

not really 

ok 

No one said that 

I am just saying if someone insulted me based on my gender, but could not really do anything to hold that difference over me from a power position, I would not care 

There will always be people with different views, and if I let that bother me it will just eat away my life 

Yes

That is what my statement says 

yes
