No

is ben affleck in it?

i dont even know who george carlin is 

i think the church is fine the way it is 

yes 

yeah

were you not? 

how did they change 

what made you change 

how were you restricted? 

im just curious..bc i dont feel restricted 

but thank you

haha no 

never really crossed my mind 

yeas 

they dont need to dedicate their lives to it 

i think the pediophilia accusations are awful 

but they can happen anywhere 

and with anyone 

and i dont know what other "wrong doings" you mean 

or i havent heard of any recently 

so what about married guys 

theyre not celibate and they still engage in these acts 

so marriage doesnt save them 

our making it sound like all priests touch little boys 

its ok 

and it canbe controlled 

very mature 

ok you win, priests are bad 

they give into urges 

whats the next opic to discuss 

topic* 

this has been the most intense convo out of all the others 

sorry

i feel like its easier to be a jerk when your chatting and not in front of people

i wouldnt go to church for a woman 

what do you mean 

i get it 

thats never going to happen though 

thats too radical of a change 

the church seems set in its ways 

arent all members of the church servantts of God? 

well what is their power now? 

no no i meant bc he said he was there 

with the pretzel 

haha ok 

how did she make the pretzel 

so what are we talking about now 

nuns? 


are you guys friends? 

i wouldnt not go 

i was saying that really wouldnt be like an incentive 

i would still go male or female 

if women were priests would that make you go 

or return to the chuch 

so where would their sexual frustrations be focused? 

JUST KIDDINGGGGGGG 

hahah 

so if women were in the church, thhey would not remain celibate 

but would marry?

Wow

that would be some change 

faith will keep then going 

them*
