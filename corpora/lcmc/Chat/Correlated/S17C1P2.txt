i think it's okay, because they are using it for a good reason 

and without it, who knows what could have happened?

really?

Lol

i think that was one of the things that was in all our prompts 

or was that a school official got the person in trouble? 

remember when we had to write about these topics? 

that's what i'm referring to 

okay

well i think anyone who would go through the trouble of collecting all that information would probably have something useful to do with it 

i agree with that 

i just looked it up on widipedia (reliable?) and it says the patriot act is only for terrorism purposes 

in which case i think it is a good idea and necessary 

no

but only if you are written up? 

like they won't go searching facebook to incriminate you unless you are already an offender? 

yeah, well for most pictures 

but i guess if you're doing a keg stand or something really overt 

what do you mean by that? 

I don't know about that 

really? because someone said earlier that myspace was public 

and facebook, because it is also on the internet, a public domain, should also be public by that logic 

not anymore 

anyone who has an email address of any kind can get a facebook account 

it was originally intended for college students, but now it's completely open to everyone 

yes

same as myspace 

well me neither, but that's what i've heard 

well you don't even need a loyola account at all 

well are phone numbers considered private? what if you're unlisted and the NSA taps into your calls? 
i'm sure they could hack in 

it's probably just as right as it would be for the NSA to track the calls from an unlisted phone nubmer 

which we seemed to think was okay 

yeah that is a very good point 

i think that falls more in the caliber of underage drinking 

not quite as noble a cause as preventing terrorism 

i think we're just not sure whether private myspace and facebook pages are considered public because of the fact that they're on the internet which is public 

yeah, because you are actively setting it to private 

i agree 

yes, i think that's how things should be, but i am not sure if that is the policy here at loyola or elsewhere 

well the patriot act says for anti-terrorism purposes 

so it should be something different than terrorism-related and terrorism-unrelated, but what should that be? 

i think for right now, everything in the middle would be considered unacceptable by most people 

it is only becuase of events like 9/11 that we have become okay with anti-terrorism precautions 
well, i'd like to think it should be, but until people see loss of lives from not doing something, they're probably unlikely to let privacy invasions take place 

i feel the same way 

but i wonder if enough people do to make that acceptable 

well i think that's awesome that it prevented a school shooting, but i'm pretty sure that if they had just discovered a love letter or something, people would have been really angry at whoever was searching ehtir lcokers as opposed to happy that at life was saved

i know in my high school we had locker inspections 

it wasn't really a controversy though 

but that was the only big incident 

no school shooting was prevented or anything like that 

well it's like any other search 

you need a search warrant, reasonable cause... 

well i don't think you actually need a search warrant to search a locker in school, i was just saying that cause could be established in the same way as any other search 

it seems like you have to put things in your locker though 

because it's the only school property you can use 

almost

i mean if you have drugs with you or something, you don't need to put THAT in your locker, but there are inevitably going to be personal things in your locker 

probably not, but i think it is the personal things that people have a hard time giving up their privacy of 

yeah

anything

like for people who don't have terrorist plans and might not want to give up their privacy, it is on the account of the personal things that they want to keep their own 

well, technically, do you have a right to privacy? and how much? i think that's really unclear
