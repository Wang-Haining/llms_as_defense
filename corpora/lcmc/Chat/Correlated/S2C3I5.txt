I just got here, didn't realize we were starting

Well the country was divided about half and half in support for the war at some point, right? 

But we are there now. I feel like if we pull out, the situation will get even worse.

For what reason? Oil? 

I think so. 

How do we know what intelligence the government may have had, though? 

Also, I don't understand why it is such a surprise that we didn't find any there. I'm sure Hussein had thousands of depots, any of which could have had WMDs. Right when we were invading, he just had to give the order to move them out of the country. 

Right after the invasion, the media was making such a big deal about how we hadn't found any. Yet with the amount of man power we had in Iraq, it was probably physically impossible to search every single depot.

So I don't think we went in for wrong reasons. Hey, no WMDs went off since then. :) 

Of course 

I think we have gotten ourselves into a bad situation. If we stay, the country is torn apart over here, we keep losing people over there, and the mission is going nowhere. If we pull out, the situation will only get worse. 

I think they should lay out some clear-cut objectives and realistic overall goals. Otherwise, if the war is going nowhere, we have to choose the lesser of two eveils and pull out. 

Being consistent? 

Well what are they doing over there right now? Just expanding out and controlling different towns? 

Heh

What benefits are we getting from Iraq? We're not actually using the oil yet 

Besides the economic benefits of war itself 

Well hmm... I guess since we are trying to impose our democracy on them 

Well hmm... I guess since we are trying to impose our democracy on them 

clockwatcher I'm confused... I was trying to say it might be like modern day colonialism since we are imposing democracy on them

So why in Iraq? 

Ok

Okay rocks, you're saying there must be some reason for our continued presence there besides democracy? 

Once its safe enough to take oil out of the country 

So basically, you guys think we are just staying in Iraq until we can take the oil out, and we don't really care about establishing a democracy there? 

rocks, explain 

I'm not sure, I never actually thought of that, clock

I don't think we can legitimately say we went in for the wrong reasons.

Unless we see every piece of intel the government collected about Iraq and WMDs, we can't make any claims about the legitimacy of our going there.

Thats how I feel at least

lol Nope
