Are there a lot of issues like this in the news, because to me generder discrimination is a thing of the past 

gender8

Sorry about that. 

I don't think so 

What type of discrimination?

Or how, I should say 

Aren't men found to be naturally more apt in certain fields, and women in others? 

Did any of you experienece any personal discrimination at your jobs, or witness it or anything? 

I definitely agree with that

Unless one person decides another person is not right for a job solely based on gender, I don't believe it is discrimination

Exactly.

But whats the trade-off? If an employer tries extra hard not to discriminate against gender, he or she could be hiring employees that are not qualified for that position. 

Men and women in the same jobs? 

I can't see how that would happen in a modern world like ours. It's rediculous.

Are we talking about high-paying business type jobs? 

haha 

this issue is really hard to tie down. There is no way to prove whether any data collected (like wage gaps) is due to discrimination or other reasons. 

And I don't know if I agree with something someone said before: the higher the wage, the bigger the gap. I would think the opposite

For a woman or man to move upward and upward on the pay ladder, ideally the person would be a charismatic, intelligent individual. I can't imagine a man and woman sitting in the same board room or something and receiving two highly seperate salaries. That is, unless it's proven fact.

Did that make sense at all? haha 

what do you mean 

? 

Well, of course. 

So what changes could be made to resolve this issue, if any?

I don't think so. Men and women have been proven to be naturally more skilled in different areas. Nothing has been proven in terms of race, however.

(answering your question, rocks) 

So I don't think something like affirmative action can ever be justified fully.

Sorry, my roommate doesn't understadn the importance of gender discrimination. lol 

Obvious gender discrimination. lol 

Something could/should definitely be done to stop gender discrimination on that level. 

Some sort of fine? 

I agree. However, in a situation where it is as clear-cut as a pizza place who only hires women, something can definitely be done

I mean men 

Absolutely
