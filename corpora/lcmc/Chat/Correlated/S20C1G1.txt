... 
i'm back and forth 

that's how i feel also 

i mean, just call it a union and the church has nothing to do with it 

they can, just don't call it a marriage, call it something else

i agree 

it's not totally accepted by society now either, so i think calling it a marriage right away would piss some people off 

whoa

lemme read all that 

yeah, i mean marriage is more of a church thing than gov't. thing....(WE HAD IT FIRST! Lol)

likewise

but even if i wasn't a catholic, i think i'd still have the same opinion on it 

marriage isn't "sacred" only because it's a thing within the church, the reason people see it in a way that noone wants to change it is because that's what most people in history have percieved it as 

did that make sense? 

i think the gov't. gives more rights to heterosexual couples because it helps out our society on a financial basis 

what are the main "rights" that you guys are focussing on?

it's all good 

well 

marriage was within the church, and when church and state united a long time ago, the state took that within itself 

that's why i think that "marriage" should stay within the church, and for the gov't. to call it something else 

totally agree 

i mean, that's not looking down on anybody 

so you're saying that the govn't would recognize EVERYONE with a certain term who is together, but marriage would only apply to couples within the church? 

just making sure i have it right 

who cares? 

i mean 

so what if "marriage" only applies to catholics, or others within the church 

it's not like people will hate catholics or vice versa 

well, banning gay MARRIAGE i'm totally cool with 
just change the word like we were saying for everyone in general, and that amendment won't make a difference 

keep in mind that our country is based on religion 

how is it not?????? 

are you kidding me? 

True

does anybody have any personal experiences with this, like talking to other gay people about it? 

i'm in the dark on this one too 

expand then 

trying to keep the conversation going...lol) 

(yesss) 

i don't mean to sound like a girl, but everybody want's loooooove, that's what humans do 

that was totally late also 

you mean change the word for only the government, right? 

ok, right 

can you go into some more detail witht hat? 

melissa, are we allowed to use like the internet here, or no? 

for future reference, yeah 

ok, thanks 

i don't think that politicians are necessarily doing it only for the vote, i mean, the people who get that high up are VERY opinionated on everything, so they already have their opinions basically set in stone 

i don't follow that rosie crap, but what politicians are with her?

(dah, they're not gonna just change their views like that....people'd call them out on that)

i'm cool with it, but you do need to keep in mind that those kids will possibly have a rough time growing up

i mean 

as a kid if you're gay, you'll get made fun of

and if you have gay parents, kids will obviously do the same

i never said that 

i was talking about getting made fun of 

well i meant have the discrimination involving gays since his parents are

this next thing is just for me 

i'm not against gays, but it really grosses me out 

is anybody the same way?

no, i know 

what do you mean by "society wise?" 

GREAT TOPIC
Lol

so here it is 

are people born gay or not?> 

ok, my neighbor has to turn out gay when he's older 

he's acted very feminine most of his life 

right now he's like 11 

you know, sometimes you can tell 

i never said he is 

two totally things 

plus

has anybody seen "dirty work?"

there's a gay german shepherd, and it's hilarious 
i had to say that, sorry 

i've seen discrimination against people who act gay, but who aren't gay

guys who act feminine is the best way to say that i mean 

well it's improved i'd say...i mean, can you imagine the gay people in schools years ago? 

expand on that 

if you could 

well 

in all honesty 

i think that everyone is more discriminatory against guys thatn girls in this

i mean 

go up to anybody, would you rather see guys or girls making out? 

definitely the chicks 

i mean, i saw 300 yesterday, and it was in there 

even most girls i've talked to say that 

i guess it's because girls are naturally more pretty than guys

it's true though 
hhahahaha
