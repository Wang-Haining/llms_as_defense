YES

in reality, i don't think it will ever go away entirely 

sorry ladies 

i'm sure it does 

yes

and yet again 

i have a personal experience 

i'm a dude secretary........i get a lot of crap 

lol

but half the time, it's me giving it to myself 

as a joke 

not that i know of 

i just talke about how i get pinched in the butt and make coffee all the tiem (not the actual case though) 

very true

 do you think that there is something wrong with some of those?

for instance, most womens voices are more "pleasant" on the phone

naturally, they make good secretaries 

for that reason i mean) 

and that's not in a discriminatory way either, like with construction, the men are just built for it 

yeah, there are some big ladies out there also 

i don't understand that 

is that just insecurity or something? 

maybe since men are naturally stronger, they feel inferior for some reason? 

well women are psychologically stronger apparently 

and i can totally see that 

i will agree to that in a heartbeat 

i don' tthink that women should be drafted 

yeah, depends on the guy 

i'm one of the few that wouldn't mind 

(and i'm not trying to act macho by saying that) 

there is 

my dad was drafted for vietnam and then got denied 

for some problem he had 

yeah, the whole drafting women thing is very controversial 

i mean, i personally don't think that they should be since they naturally aren't cut out for it as men, but if they want to be equal, then they should be treated as equals

i'm like at a standstill 

so do you mean that the draft should count for women, and a lot should get denied, but the few capable ladies should go on? 

but also with infants, the woman can't go because of natural needs of the baby 

but if they want to be equal, then all of them should 

that's like giving them an advantage 

well wait a second 

what about earlier when we said that women are psychologically stronger? 

(generally...) 

just throwing it out there... 

lol

that's a terrific point 

not good....terrific....good job 

lol 

but yeah, but if we continue to look at it that way, then they'll never be treated equally 

i think that they will definitely be treated equally in daily life, etc., but in different areas they'll never be 

daily life including things such as jobs, etc. like the CEO bit you were talking about right then 

especially since CEO positions don't need muscle 

yeah, totally 

i think it means that everyone, including all females able, will go in for the draft

like we said earlier, only the ones able will go on 

like the girls that can't do a pushup won't...but it's also the same way for guys 

it all goes back to stereotypes in reality 

men are more intimidating than women, which is also why you see them in these high ranking positions everywhere 

yeah, and even though some men can't do the pushups, more men than women can 

well i think now a days women are also just about, if not equal to men in ambition 

hell, i can't do 50 pushups 

lol

i mean damn, im a stringbean 

well.... 

races are "equal," but they're not actually equal 

you know what i mean? 

well i think they already are respected just as much if they're in the military

i mean, yeah, their physical tests are easier, but that's just allowing nature to take its course since women "cant do those 50 pushups”

yeah, ability should determine the equality, i mean, we obviously shouldn't look down upon people who can't do as much as others, but yeah, i agree in the workplace that people should only advance if they well deserve it

frogger, you mean like sitcoms? 

if you mean like sitcoms, then yeah, it does put them to a disadvantage

but on the other hand, it is our natural course, of say like how women are more nurturing 

for some reason, i'm thinking of Home Improvement right now

let's compare that to Full House 

i think those are two good things to compare 

for instance, tim allen works with tools while whoever his wife is is more of the nurturing character 

but then look at bob saggot in full house of how he's very feminine and cleans and vaccuums, but on the other hand, he can't play sports or do physical labor worth crap 

but in sitcoms the natural tendency is like home improvement

i've only watched like 2 episodes 

that's society turning things around, showing that, since it's more of a recent show, how views have been, and are continuing to change 

i think they do though- because of what little....just said, and it portrays the views of society quite well 

i agree 

(dave chapelle....) 

Lol

sorry, i had to 

this guy totally meant it 

well, not that he meant it, but that's how he talks 

he's a southern man 
brought up through the south in the 60's and 70's 

isn't he buds with howard stern, or no? 

because the south mixed with stern......= that comment 

i'm not saying it's right, i'm just saying that there are still people like that and inequalities in that sense does still exist for reasons such as that 

i think in a few generations it will be in textbooks though 

i mean, look at how one/two generations has changed views on Race AND Gender

yeah, nothing this big and this imbedded in even our culture will change over night

but i do see a promising future 

fa sho fa sho 

wow, what an uplifting end 

but look at the nations reaction to imus' comment 

it was an absolute outrage 

that just tells you that so many people are willing to have and implement change, and even looking at the students accepting the apology, it shows that both "sides" are willing to cooperate through this in the future 

which also shows that they are "gaining power" towards "equality"...for whatever it stands as 

woop woop! 

is everyone else just waiting? 

lol 

hahahahah

c'mooooon

hahah 

any last comments? 

i'll just say that for melissa
