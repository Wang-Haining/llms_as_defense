ok 

if its going to be used like any other drug to cure an illness then i am in favor of its medical use 

yea it should be a federal matter 

all or none 

i think if it is a proven medical situation it should either be used or not used 

haha yea i mean i am for that 

yea i agree 

yea pot is just to prevalent in our society (college) to not be a used commodity 

more people smoke then one would assume, from all walks of life from professors to doctors to us, so as long as its out there people will buy it

sure

the economic remifications would be nuts, plus it is a gateway drug, which sounds lame but its true 

but not in the same way as alcohol or cigarettes, it really makes you aware of entire sub culture of drugs that arent necessarily out in the open like booze 

oh i wont disagree with that 

im for it 

yea i really dont think it would change much either 

haha thats true and in the grand scheme of things it does make you dumber 

haha well if your already doing one i dont think your brain needs both 

you would have a whole new breed of burnout drunks 

it would be much like a third of loyola 

yea probably 

i mean certain professions lend themselves to certain lifestyles 

yea kids do like to drink 

do you think lots of pro athletes smoke pot 

yea i mean passing tests isnt to tough, but offseason would be the time to smoke if you are them

if kids saw pro athletes smoking pot that could increase a younger crowd 

yea it would be interesting 

yea 

amount one can carry 

out of ones residence 

18

i dont know about that 

being high in public is a much more peaceful thing then being drunk in public

no i dont mean at work 

i mean like to go out and eat 

i mean like to go out and eat 

yea its all about the image of the pot head that hurts pot

if it becomes legal it opens up the door for many new places to be high 

yea if they are both legal then they are one in the same at work
