i think the logic is you are married ot god 

lets talk about the celibacy issue 

do you think it is effective in strenthening their relationship with god?

well just having marraige an option would deter less people from priesthood 

so for practical reasons, i think they might have to 

the catholic church seems so strict that i wonder if they would ever really do that 

it's always a struggle at first to make a chage, but then people accept it 

*change 

but then how would you account for the changes up to now? 

it hasnt been perfectly consistent up to this point 

yes, it needs to be able to service its members 

which involves flexibility 

i really don't see what the big deal is in allowing priests to marry - other denominations do it 

well you could make a rule against that 

it doesnt have to be against marraige 

yeah, thats a good point 

ok

what would happen if an already married person wanted to be a priest? could they get divorced or would that make it impossible too?

i like to think of a deacon as a part-time priest 

i'm not sure if that's theologically correct 

that makes more sense 

yeah

me too 

still

they're still catholics though right? 

that seems kind of silly

 do you think a marraige can be "not real" anyway? i mean it existed

wow!

that seems understandable given the process 

and i'm sure it would take a very long time, during which you would still be married 

ithink it was communion 
yes, i would agree also 

they could extend that to any opinion they disagree with 

anyone who supports gay marriage can't receive either 

i don't think the church should force you to conform to their beliefs in order to participate 

yeah, i think if you start with this, things can get out of control quite easily

so i don't support starting with something like this 

i just don't think you should exclude someone from communion based on their opinions 

you can still be a Catholic and have a different opinion than the church 

otherwise, there would hardly be any, because most people have their disagreements in some way with the Catholic church 

but is it realistic to expect Catholics to believe in every single doctrine of the church? it may be ideal, but i don't think it actually works like that

well the church doctrines are created by people 

so who's to say they couldn't be wrong? it's not directly connected to Jesus 

that was exactly my point, clockwatcher 


i think by that strict a definition, a lot of people who call themselves Catholics would not be 

it seems like a bit of a paradox, just thinking about our Loyola education 

we are learning to think critically, so we shouldn't be expected to blindly follow the church 

i think so 

i think that still makes you an acceptable Catholic 

you're not perfect in the Church's eyes, but who is? 

i would consider you a critical, thoughful catholic who has to believe in something for themselves 

what do you mean "infallible institution", goldeneye? 

well i guess the same would apply for anything 

this is not unique to the Catholic church, though 

well i would disagree right from that starting point, but continue 

on controversial subjects, there is plenty of room for opinion 

it seems like you are just saying to follow the experts 

is that a good assessment of what you're getting at, goldeneye? 

well, then, how would you account for experts being wrong? because that has happened, and it's been discovered because of people who did not follow blindly, but had their own opinions
