oh i get it now...this i not ur typical gender discrimination

because they have always had to struggle 

i understand that its not fair for male owned businesses to be recievin a cut just becuz they are male but if you think about women and minorities had to struggle to get the same rights as males

i think they will be equalled out when the playing fields are leveled 

i agree with frankie27 

well then the playing fields will have leveled and affirmative action will be tossed out the door 

becuz by that time everyone will be recievin the same opportunities

yea that is tru becuz if you think about even white women have to struggle 

what do you mean by ppl cant try to force it

oh ok 

but then wat other way is there 

oh i c then 

so what if nature is a world with white males succeeding then its ok? 

lol yea tru 

i feel that it may it will jus take some time 
it may die out though 

with the older generation dyin out so will many of their ideas

umm i dont think so 

yea i agree with livingdeadbeat 

mayb the word is throwin me off from agreein wit u 

how bout take out the word ego

lol...better 

tru...shell out some money that will shut ppl up 

what do u mean by the feminist part? 

ohhh!!! 

i c

feminists werent always like that

ryte?

Tru

they do...they walk aorund sayin men cant do this and men cant do that

tru

thats just stupid 

very tru...even for homosexual relationships you still need men to exist

exactly

even the very few women that do have jobs as high as men are considered manly 

yea then its not the same 

what??? 

i kno...and there are plenty of places for men...like underneath a car, mowin the grass 

what are tryna say frankie? 

yea it should 

u really didnt kno? 

Wow

thats like one of the first things ppl say when they talk about gender discrimination 

oh aite 

lol

aight sorry 
yea that is tru

as of right now the major complaint is that women still dont get paid as much as men 

ohhh

i like 

i agree!!! 

whats chapter11? 

oh 

lol
