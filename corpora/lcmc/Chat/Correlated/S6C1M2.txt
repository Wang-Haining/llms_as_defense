yup 

yay marijuana 

me too) i should start this conversation by saying that i do not, in fact, smoke, but it's probably going to sound like i do 

(sry, in response to John

Hahaha

so yeah 

(hand goes up) 

frankly, high people are way less obnoxious than drunks, in my experience

well, supposedly it can cause minimal memory loss, but the research on that is debatable 

and it depends on where you're getting it as to how dangerous it is

pure pot is not nearly as bad as cigarettes 

yeah, it's often cut with additives 

yeah. frankly, i think one of the man issues standing in the way of legalization is that it can't be taxed or regulated easily 

good god yeah 

yeah, and it depends on the dealer, too, and how many middlemen are in between them and the supplier 

i think they'd tax it as much as they could 

they wouldn't necessarily control the supply, but they do place taxes on alcohol, cigarettes, gasoline, etc

yeah. and b/c they like money

hah, i'm not saying i don't, i just don't like the gov't having too much of my money

mm....i'm an asthmatic, but maybe once or twice a year 

i know a lot of adults who still smoke, too 

yeah, i like that idea 

yeah. like i said, potheads are less obnoxious 

it usually doesn't cause hallucinations 

unless it's cut w/ something 

the effects vary from person to person, too 

generally it mellows you, and in many cases intensifies sensory perception (that;s why potheads like pretty lights and pink floyd

they have bars and cafes for it in amsterdam 

and you have to have a license for it, like a liquor store
yeah, but there are plenty of things that you can get buzzed off of that are easy to find 

yeah, my friend took the sat's high, and got a 1590 (true story) 

yeah 

it doesn't impede SOME people's cognitive processes 

but it's not a safe bet (didn't study? try pot!....great ad slogan) 

even if there are minimal long term health effects, i think it should. both alcohol and tobacco have long-term health effects 

right, but they're still serious 

well, they say they can, but the gov't says it can do a lot of things

yeah 

i'd go w/ that 

probably not 

yeah, i would say so 

right. it just says don't do everything else. 

Yeah

i wouldn't fault someone for not wanting to smoke on moral grounds, but i don't feel that way 

yeah, but it's hard to do legal research on it right now 

since it's still an illegal substance 

medical research can be done, but there's a lot of red tape 

and most of that type of research has gov't involvement 

they experimented w/ lsd as truth serum in the 60s 

hahaha 

yeah, but that doesn't mean they will. i don't think they want to legalize it for economic reasons 

but not them 

it'd be much harder to tax though, b/c it's production and distribution is fundamentally different from other controlled substabces 

but you can't stop all the people who already grow it in their house, back yards, etc., from still undercutting the market illegally at a cheaper price

right, but alcohol is expensive to make and distribute; it's not worth the trouble, financially. A LOT of people could still grow pot illegally, and that would disrupt the legal market 

if there are taxes on it, i think it would be a big deal 

you have to remember too that when it is grown en masse, it's normally imported illegally. and it would all be regulated in theory, but right, that doesn't stop illegal entrepreneurs 
it was strictly prohibited for a very short period, though, and was largely controlled by the mob during that time 

but you already have a huge embedded system of people producing and selling pot 

but not for an extended period, and probably not nearly as large or sophisticated 

well, i dunno. i'd argue that the black market would continue unabated, and that's what the gov't is afraid of (i'm not saying i wouldn't legalize it for those reasons)

probably some, but they'd have to be prepared to pay a lot more for a long time, and i think that that portion of the market isn't large enough for the gov't to care about 

but i think the gov't is more concerned w/ a.) making as much money as possible, and b.) erradicating the black market 

i dunno, making it 21 gives a lot of credence to the drinking age, too

hey! i love that movie 

i think it should be legalized to possess in small quantities 

that's what i mean 

that's what the denver law says 

indeed

aideu for now, all 

adieu
