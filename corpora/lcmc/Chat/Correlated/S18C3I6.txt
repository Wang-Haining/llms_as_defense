i know nicole, i plan on writing another 

we can do that right? 

Well

I think bush was very sneaky 

and played off the tail end of the 9/11 buzz to get support 

well don't you think thats what he did? 

war on terror! kill terrorism

yea but why do you think we went? 

Yea

Eh

well i don't believe it was gas 

/oil 

because the prices are still exorbitant 

how can you say that? 

Haha

that was the reason they gave, at least 

down the crapper? 

how the hell would we invade a country thats almost a complete oil mine and our gas prices rise?

im not being sarcastic

 i don't know anything about economics 

it just seems illogical 

well, thats why i threw out that reason 

well, even intelligent people who want us to stay there (like mccain) believe the war is being carried out in the completely wrong way 

training troops is poorly done, etc 

but at this point it may be too late to turn around 

thats my main question 

is it too late? or would us being there after a revised system was put in place be better than if we were never there at all? 

we helped make the mess... is there even a chance we can clean something up?

a deadline is not really the right answer 

that would be like vietnam 

yea, but is it stable enough?

also, here's another point: 

(a selfish one) 

(a selfish one) 

save our boys 

just throwing it out there 

thats a COMPLETELY different issue. 

No

i wouldn't have enlisted

i wouldn't have enlisted

also, the overwhelming majority of soldiers DO believe in doing their job, if not believe in what theyre doing as well 

exactly

not all the time 

the armed forces can't read any minds 

i dont know, i dont think any of us can talk unless we are over there/are close to someone over ther

we'll you're both braver people than i am 
well screw me then 

sorry 

i "navigated away from the page" 

gradual

gradual

well wasn't the focus rebuilding without hussein?
