The gay church?? 

yes please 

because that makes a huge difference in teh church's eyes 

well in response to a.) i definitely think that priests should be allowed to marry

yes and also that jesus wasn't married so neither should priests be 

(and not to get off topic but with all of teh da vinci code and similar stuff coming out, that is questionable)

but i think those are the only reasons 

yeah i know that i'm just saying that it has sparked a lot of research etc.

ok forget i brought that up 

but i think that jesus and complete devotion are teh reasons for celibacy

and personally i think that the priests could better connect/relate with a larger percentage of the parish if he was married

and yes crash, that would help to bring the numbers back up 

i feel that it's getting to that point now 

the church has evolved over the centuries to adapt (example, vatican II) so i don't see what the big deal is 

well the current pope benedict is ultra conservative, so i don't see it happening under him 

i agree that consistency is good, but the times have changes so drastically from the hundreds and hundreds of years that teh church has been in existence so some change is necessary to maintain followers 

i agree rocks 

and in response to the celibacy of priests, that is a completely manmade law. way back when, they used to be able to marry, and then some people got together and decided against it

exactly 

yeah and that doesn't really apply anymore 

priests of other denominations seem to be perfectly able to devote themselves to their families AND to their church 

so i don't see why catholic priests would be so inept in doing that 

yes, but there are certain regulations 

you can't be a deacon and THEN get married 

if you are married first, you can become a deacon though

no, sorry...i just know that my uncle wanted to become a deacon, but he was planning on getting married soon 

so he had to wait to become a deacon otherwise he wouldn't be able to get married 

and he hasn't become a deacon yet...i don't think he's going to anymore

so if deacon's can be married, why can't priests??? 

i guess so 

pretty much everything a priest can do during mass except for consecration 

but i'm not positive 

exactly crash 

i'm not sure about divorce/annulment, but i know that if you are a widower, you CAN become a priest 

so you don't have to have never had sex 

that's kind of asking a lot to require that all men entering the priesthood be virgins

yeah but i would HOPE that someone who wanted to be a priest would not lie in order to take their vows 

i don't know 

i am against that 

yeah and it is an EXTREMELY difficult process to obtain an annulment 

yes you have to get all of these letter of witness from people who knew you during the marriage and they have to write about specific reasons why the marriage was not real in the first place 

and those people have to be catholic i believe and they have to get their priests to sign the letters 

and then the whole application has to be signed by a ton of different people in teh church hierarchy 

all the way up to the vatican 

it's a ridiculous process and it takes FOREVER 

so a lot of people choose not to go through it and just get a legal divorce

so i don't think that they should be denied communiion 

yeah basically an annulment says that the marriage never existed int he first place...that for some reason or another one person entered into teh marriage under false pretenses i believe 

yes....if there was dishonesty right from the start, like the people wanted two different things 

so where were we going with this, not that we have a background of what an annulment is? 

*now 

i completely agree goldeneye 

on a similar note, i read an article about how politicians who are pro-choice are also not supposed to recieve communion 

i agree, but to play the other side, how do you decide at which point this becomes too much? like when you disagree with too many points, are you no longer a catholic?? 

yes but i have heard some catholic say "catholicism is not like a chinese menu, you can't pick and choose what to believe and what not to believe" 

right and i think that from the official church position, as a catholic you are supposed to spread the ideas of teh catholic church, not just choose somethings to believe and disregard others 

not i don't think that is it realistic, but from the official Church view, i wonder what they say? 

the way i personally rationalize it (me being a catholic but NOT believeing in everything) is that many of the doctrines that i disagree with were created by man, not by God 

exactly

i'm just asking whether OFFICIALLY....are you a catholic if you don't believe everything?? 

but catholics have different views about the consecration and teh divinity of christ, etc 

that are not connected to these manmade laws 

right rocks, i don't think it's fair though to ask people not to think for themselves and to just blindly believe everything becasue that's what their church believes

goldeneye?? 

can you elaborate rocks? 

agreed rocks 

goldeneye, i don't know...that's a very tough call. but personally i would like to think that i still have a religion even though i don't blindly follow everything i'm told. 

i would like to think so too......even just for the fact that if not, then where does that leave me? 

as i was trying to say before...i DON"T pick and choose on the aspects of teh divinity of christ or more of the faith aspect...but i do disagree with some of the lifestyle "rules" 

well me too then lol 

yeah, that's a lot to ask of anyone or thing 

humans by our very nature are subject to making mistakes.....so an infallible instituation in the hands of anyone other than GOd is bound to be fallible 

which i believe was exactly what you said goldeneye 

so then taking that into account, do you still think that you have to believe EVERYTHING to call yourself a catholic, given the fallibility of the institution? 

i'm with rocks on this one 

i understand what you are saying goldeneye about not knowing much about a specific technical subject, but i'm with crash about knowing about your OWN life 

moral decisions apply to other religions other than just catholicism 

so where is there room for personal choice in this goldeneye? 

i just kind of think that that's a short cut --- an excuse for not having to think for yourself 

will you send us a reminder email before next time nicole??
