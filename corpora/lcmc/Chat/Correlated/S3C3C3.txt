sorry, but is anybody saying anything right now? i just want to make sure my internet didn't freeze again

wow, i diea. i'm sorry 

died*

what's wrong with the structure of the church?

do you mean like the heirarchy? 

paternalistic? like only men can be preiests? 

i feel the same dah88 

i agree with that 

women being priests i think would solve a lot of problems many people have with the church 

but about the heirarchy... what would happen to the church if the pope wasnt the lead authority any more? 

ok, i guess i just dont understand 

so you think the church should be more democratic instead of authoritarian? 

because that would be a good idea 

i agree 

i think a religion has a certain amount of responsibility to stick to its foundations, but also a responsibility to serve the needs of its people 

yeah... but girl can play on boys teams if they really want to and they're good 

you seem to have a really positive view of the role of nuns....

i know but its true - all we can do in the church is pray in convents, and give homilies once in a while 

hey i know, i didnt mean it to sound like that 

its just cause you're right 

right now women can't really contribute to the church at all 

but we're still members..

well neither do priests, really, do they? 

that goes back to the heirarchy 

true 

wow i never knew that 

i believe it 

being a nun seems liek the equivalent of being a monk to me

right 

and thats right for some women 

but others would do better in the role of a priest 

what is the whole women not being preists thing based on anyhow? the 12 apostles? 

ok 

well 

i know that lots of things in the church are based on tradition, and that is good. we wouldn't have religion without tradition. but it seems to me that when the tradition becomes this ingrained and stubbornly enforced, its more of a hindrance than a help 

i used to 

thats what i thought 

and it makes no sense to me 

because that was a day and age where only men really had to option to "go out and spread the good word" like that 

and now women have the same abilities and responibilities that men do 

hahahahaha

i bet 

right, thats what ive heard 

but is that a good reason for it to stay that way? 

Same

Right

for 2000 years ago 

hey, Christ wasn't dumb 

well he probably didn't think that his followers would imitate every single little thing he did for centuries 

its like how some people use the old testament to jusitfy gay bashing 

haha yeah

seriously

yep - and times have changed 

just more reasons the catholic church should rethink its traditions 

also, the only accounts we have of his life are secondhand

and mostly written by men

so we don't ACTUALLY know what he did and didn't do to the specifics

yeah 

there's so much going against the literal interpretation of the Bible - it's almost irrational to take it as absolute truth

wow ok 

lol 

my grandpa and uncle who are deacons feel the same way

yeah 

they have to put on the appearance of unity though 

i suppose... 

yeah - i mean, the church even got to decide what we regard as the Bible 

so how are we supposed to say that the Bible is absolute?

from beginning to end it's human interpretation 

and by human, i mean men 

really? why? 

aww - well i have to say that sucks, but it does depend on the church 

my cousin is 19 and she got pregnant out of marriage last year, and her church was very supportive 

it's so different from area to area 

its awful 

yeah

no, not at all, because the higher-ups probably wouldn't care at all

it would just be going through the motions

i think that somehow everyone over 50 would have to leave the church first before that happened 

thats true 

nonono, i meant all the cardinals and all 

here

i know some nice, very liberal old preists who want to change - but they are the serious minority 

at least from what i've seen 

thats what i think too 

i think the voting system would never work until there are people in power who will listen to the votes 

thats true 

ahhhh! global issues!

i actually completely forgot that there might be people elsewhere in the world who would fight to keep the church the way it is 

wow, there is SO much to think about in overhauling a massive oranization like the church 

haha we could break off and form our own church like England did 

haha ooooooh yeah i can

just kidding about breaking off :) 

i think we need to see what the majority says first 

we dont really know how other countries feel at all right now

at least i dont 

what about africa? 

there are still a large percentage of catholics in africa 

even if they die for it 

i believe it 

the thing is, we're comfortable enough here that we can philosophize about ways to make it better 

in africa, so much is going on that they just accept what is 

what are we assuming? that everyone else wouldn't want to change?
i couldnt say one way or another without a poll
