Personally, I don't think we should have gone in in the first place, but being that we are there now, just pulling out all at once is going to do nothing but harm

You know i've never thought about it that wat 

*wya 

**way 

but that makes a lot of sense 

Also we as the public dont REALLY know all the information that the government had 

Terrifying

they're stabalizing the government 

they're working on it, rome wasn't built in a day 

try and take two friends who disagree on something, they still aren;t going to agree 

I think there is, it's just going to take time 

i think its possible for there to be a peace 

maybe not perfect 

I dont think its fair to really just blame bush 

the house and the senate had to agree to go over there as well 
thats not true 

he has to clear it through the house and the senate 

we are indeed at war 

I think we shouldnt have gone in, at least not as soon as we did, but being there now, pulling out wouldn't work 

i also think its not as black and white as "should we be there or not" 

it was stable by killing anyone who disagreed with him 

thats not a stable government 

But the thing is , just pulling out and leaving,all at oncem is only going to make things worse 

and honestly 

do you really think they're going to only fight each other? its gonna spread 

not us, i mean in the middle east 

they aren't just going to fight/ kill what have you each other 

theres a history of conflict between tons of countries 

not really an excuse for fighting

So you think its justified to continue fighting and killing just for revenge? 

i agree 
oh absolutly 

but thats anywhere 

america hasnt exactly endeared itself to the hearts of the world 

is our goal really to be liked though? 

i dont think we are 

i dont 

absolutly GBD 

But what is that goal 

*route 
there will never be a day where everyone agrees on a government, or a central religion etc 

its not feasible 

But there is a way to Comprimise 

they're tearing their own homes apart 

they were before we got there 

i know 

frustration is one thing, hate is another 

thats not going to cause hate aimed at america though , its going to cause hate aimed at other iraqis 

So are you saying we should give up on trying to find a way to change a corrupt system? 

just because its hard, and its gonna take time? 

then what 

well than whats the right way 

then who are you to criticize the people who are trying 

i dont think so 

i dont think anyone wants to live in a dictatorship 

where you cant make your own decisions 

so you're saying because people are different they will never get along?

its hard, but its not impossible, and at least now theres an attempt at change 

not just "Hey we hated each other this long, lets keep going" 

hatred is not as set in stone as people think 

it just takes one person to change it 

one person to think differently 

and now a lot of people are thinking differently 

why not 

my point is that its not one person anymore 

no

i dont know if anyones asked them 

im not sure we even agree on what we're discussing now 

this war is a lot more complex than people give it credit for 

im not sure if youre yelling in agreement or anger lol 

absolutely

its yellow journalism, and its been around for ages 

or a bit of both 

entertainment factor 

depends on where you watch shoop 

absolutly it is 

and they spin it to bias it even more 

personally i read my news from BBC 

not as biased 

so are the german papers, intriguing to read their views 

i dont know if i agree about t that DGBD 

i think theyre just more informed 

yeah i do blue 

exactly!

these things are our headlines 

its ridiculous 

but see 

WHO CARES 

why do we care 

i dont 

thats not news 

they arent issues though, thats not news, and shouldnt be headlines

there are ISSUES going on that people need to be informed about 

and he was dead right 

People stop thinking about what goes on outside their small tiny sphere of influence 

something catastrophic did happen, 9/11 

and people were up in arms.... 

absolutly 

but we are there

do you guys think we should just pull out and leave? 

i think going after osama isnt gonna do much 

exactly

no and no 

100% with you 

wait a second 

we went into iraq to get saddam

never under the pretense that it was for osama

we went into iraq becasue there were "weapons of mass destruction" 

still a danger though 

we were already having most of these issues and would have them anyway 

pulliing out of iraq isnt going to fix our issues 

i think thats oversimplifying to a HUGE degree 

yeah but generalization is not a good way to explain things it just muddies the waters 

i was just makign a comment, not bashing sorry shoop 

So im curious 

do you guys think that we should just pull out of iraq? 

i agree 

but then what is your solution 

how

i dont really see another way to do it while we are there, we arent going "there peace is organized now be happy and frolic in the fields together

we're trying to just keep the tenous" "peace" that is there 

or desert yeah 

haha

haha

am i the only one who just thought "Cake or Death?" 

sadly no 

bbut it made me laugh all the same 

nice

i thought it was till 6 

ah ok 

its definitely a not fun place 

and i wish to hell we werent there, i dont want my brother (marine) ending up over there, but we cant just leave it the way it is 

hopefullu 

::knock on wood:: 

im moderate, neither one nor the other 

haha

really?

im with donny 

death penalty, but anti abortion? how does that work, both are murder

if you go that way 

but here's the thing
