Heh

every time this question gets asked i slide more towards yes 

lol

what do you mean by that? 

theyre not good catholics, obviously 

i mean no one argues that those priests are awful people that should be punished severely 

yea, i guess 

i don't look at priests in that way 

i mean it sounds corny, but jesus is the catholic's main role model 

yea

well thats a sad statistic 

"just because of that”

divorce is pretty serious 

its not a "just because" 

mortal sins 

if you tell mommy you brushed your teeth and didn't, you can still receive
acting on it

which is probably the most controversial part of the church right now 

did anyone see this weeks southpark on the church and gays?

it was done very well 

it made fun of 

lol no 

it made fun of how stubborn and unrealistic the catholic church is

assuming that you can just "pray the gay away" 

which is not the case, obviously 

or, hopefully everyone here agrees that's not the case... does anyone believe in that"? 

onononono

that being gay is a choice 

and by praying you can become straight 

yea

exactly, thats the topic theyre dealing with 

what do you mean 
and youre saying it should be, right? 

if yes, i agree 

science should be taken into consideration for everything 

go girls

so why not priests? 

Haha

well thats cause they can't 

if you open the door im sure some women will think about it 

definately 

i mean, it wouldnt hurt 

unless men think "girls can be priests? f**k it then"" 

why would it be the same way? 

i guess 

yea 

mhm

exactly

better in a sterile environment then a coat hanger in an alley 

well then dont have sex 

just playing devil's advocate man 

condoms are not the devil 

fornication is fornication... why not go the full nine and use condoms 

devils advocate = backing up a view i dont believe to further the discussion 

oh

well

nah 

i guess the most diplomatic way would to get surgery 

lmao 

really?

well then youre only sinning once as opposed to (number of times you plan on having sex in the future) 

were there condoms or some form of them back in biblical times?

Mm

priests marrying? 

agreed 

haha topic closed 

mhm
