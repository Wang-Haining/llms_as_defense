I do 

My personal belief is that it has gone on far too long. The war itself no longer has a focus or a clear and distinct aim. We were trying to give democracy to a nation that previously had not experienced it, but that goal seems to have long since parished

My other thought dealing with the length is the drain it has had on the domestic economy and overall morale

Well with that hindisight Bush should correct his actions and not send more troops 

In all fairness, we all make mistakes...their's are far more visible 

I just believe they should be able to spot their mistake and correct it now

not make it worse 

Exactly, it does not seem, domestically anyway, that there is still a strong drive for democracy 

To some extent I agree with that, but the US should be a force that other countries can come to for aide 

Silently, the people of Iraq 

they were clearly sufferring under their current rule 

True, and we cannot help everyone on the planet at once

You do not have to pick, do what you can with your limited resources
Not every person in the world is sufferring because their government is a tyrrany, but rather because it is underdeveloped 

We would not invade an underdeveloped country because it is underdeveloped

so then why invade every country where people are sufferring, that's an irrational generalization 

By the very nature of us being enclosed on planet Earth, we will never have an infinite amount of resources 

Certainly

There's a difference between learning from your previous mistakes and failiing to take future actions. We cannot let past failures with good intent stop us from trying for future good intentions merely because we failed...think about it, if you failed a test in a class, would you just say you learned from failing that and not take the next one - no, you would try harder and strive for that same intention 

Even if in hindsight it turned out their were no weapons...is that a risk we could take, to assume there were no weapons even if we had the smallest of inclinations that they did 

We have taken action against North Korea in a political manner as opposed to war 

Maybe some sort of physical threat is yet to come 

You seem to forget the years before the war, both Bushes and Clinton....there have been political actions

It would be, agreed. It would encompass many uninterested and unmotivated fighters 

I do not feel that 

Reasons to fight can differ from person to person 

I know there is no way I would be motivated to fight in a draft - there are too many other thing important to me to do that with my life.

Agreed

Sorry about that 

All terrorist groups 

it's a fight against terrorism 

The ideal thereof 

I think you may be mixing separate fights 

The independence of Iraq and then terrorist groups 

true enough, but terrorism can exist beyond the boundaries of Iraq as well 

I happen to have CNN as my homepage, and maybe once a month I see on the front page that they have caught some new member of Al Queda 

Or killed 

Not directly, it would seem 

Really

There is only one leader in the organization 

So if at Loyola all the teachers left, but the President was still here, just as effective? 

Obviously

Are cries for the fight have been worldwide

You and I both know the difference between a teacher and an effecitve teacher 

Yes

and that battle lives on 

There are still insurgeons fighting against the cause in Iraq - supporters of Hussein 

The hierarchy has students, teachers, and the president - without good teachers, the new students will suffer, or perhaps there will be a diminishing return on new students because of a lack of teachers 

They are not free 

that is incorrect, there is still very much danger over in the territory 

Where do you get that idea?

Did you not see the Iraqis all over the world celebrating the day they got their freedom rom tyrannical rule 
You see victory in a very clear cut way - for instance crossing a finish line in a marathon, but what if that marathon is to raise money for aids, was there not some small victory in the race itself, the attempt thereof 

Do no misconstrue my point, I believe the war should be ended. But I am saying we have done great deeds thuis far

Ended tyrrany 

sent a message on terrorism 

There is no magic that can end it in a matter of 4 years 

you are oversimplifying this 

What does that have to do with? 

What is your point? 

Things change, things happen...we cannot predict the future 

So because we are not properly perpared, we should stop the fight?

We are not prepared to fight AIDS, should we stop that fight as well 

I do not support it, I support the motives 

there is clearly a more efficient way to accomplish them, however 

Most certainly can...I can support the idea of baseball, but not like a particular player 

Definitely

cutting off resources, getting many more countries to join in this effort 

And maybe war is still the answer for some of it 

just saying what is there now, is not working 

Certainly the UN can be extremely powerful, but they have no force to stop a country from terrorism 

That is true 

What kind of example is the UN setting 

Does it really seem like there would be Peace in Iraq had we not come in...granted there is still violence, relatively it is a lesser amount 

Unfortunately, this world we live in does not allow for peace to accomplish all great hings 

Relatively better though Klutzo 

we are not saying democracy for everyone 

there are places where governments work just fine, but ideally, yes, all citizens should have a say in their society 

Because we can't take on the world all at once 

you miss the idea of limited resources 

Let me explain 

We live on a planet, a finite space - thus having finit resources

finite*

Who's to say, one country at a time

Who do you think 

Hopefully our decision makes can make an adequate decision 

So we should be selfish and turn our backs to the world 

Some places, no 

I most certainly did 

but you seem to be missing the core of this argument 

there are people out there who need help, and it is our duty to help them if they so chose 

That celebration did not show signs of welcomeness? 

Were you in a cave during that time? 

How could they, they would be put to death by their leaders 

Who's to say, certainly economically yes 

I can live with bullying tyrannical powers 
What? 

Shouldn't we 

they could harm you 

Clearly it is extremely difficult or this "magic trick" of a war would be over now

It is not easy 

I have read history, America's in particular 

It would be ridiculous to think that it is easy

We have democracy

why would they 

They didnt 

Pretty clear-cut 

Have democracy 

So then you admit we have a democracy in America 

So just not even try Janada? 

You said other countries aren't imposing Dem. on us - it's because we have it!

As people of planet earth, it is up to us to aide each other 

No, there has to be action!
