well, i think that if people have an annulment they should still be able to have communion 

like, what if you could not get an annulment for some reason, but needed to get out of an abusive maragie or something 

i feel like that is just a reall loose rull though....like they dont go around saying....."the body of christ...oh by they way if ur a divorsee you cant eat this...." 

yeah, so like i said...i feel as if the rull is really inaffective 

haha

well there goes half the congrigation 

like i understand that they dont feel as if people sould get divorceed, so that is why they made up the annulment process if the case is really necessary

but i do understand that a lot of the reason why people get divorced is b/c they decided to get married too soon in life when they "meet the one....like they have not really dated that person long enough to relaly know what they are like through all circumstances....so like they are trying to prevent that i guess 

yaeh

actually...i find that a lot of places abroad (aka europe) are not that church going eithe 

no idea 

i agree with that 

yeah, in the end it is God who does the determining in the church 

so like i said,....i feel as if the rule is just kinda there, but not really ever followed 

yeah, cause that is a person made judgment 

like....we made that rule up to begine with, it was not always that way

like i understand that they say that so that the priest can just focus on the church....cause it is hard to have a family and be there for them all the time but also be availible to all the church congrigation 

wich is why they made the rule in the first place way back when

but...i am not sure....i feel as if there could allow decans to marry and give out communion and wine and do the other sacraments (cause right now they cant do all of that stuff) 

like they can marry

but then they cant do all of the other stuff...that is reserved for the "celebrate priest" 

basically they can do everything a priest does but the sacramenst i think

i feel as if femals should be allowed to be priests 

haha 

oh let me tell you wombs are scary 

not have sex 
ok, so for ur little argument sake (thanks for taking the other side by the way) but adam could have refused the "apple" so he sined just as much as eve did...she just did if first 

but they both sinned...he could have refused 

then he is weak!!! 

well i guess that is true...man did inherit the earth 

why would they be any more manipulative and greedy then men? 

i mean men as in humans...not the sex 

would not tell that to ur girl friend now...she might not be with you for too much longer 

well....lets see 

they are humans 

and thus have civil liberties 

and civil rights 

and who is to say that they can go to church and have the church represent them if they can be apart of the church 

kinda like how women were taxed b/f they got the vote 

they had to pay taxes but had men be their spokes persons

ignoring the aspect that one is a govt and one is a church for a moment....in each case men were the ones that represented them 

now in order to be equal 

should they not have a chance to represent themselves 

so basicaly this could be one of those "rare cases" where the church does change 

well..yes and no,....the over all messages are the same for both sexes, but ones that deal with a specific gender usu. have a reason for doing so

yeah...i feel that when we get a new pope...cause i doubt this one will live for very long,...i feel as if the church will go more modern 

cause this guy is still from WWII 

our grandparents who are old fashion 

haha

yeah...i feel as if that is not always right 

well..they have had two very old priest already 

and i feel as if they will next want one who is "fresh" and thus will have newer views 

and also a lot of those old priest who elect 

will be dead prob 
they like being stuck in the old ways 

but i really feel as if a modern twist is going to come soon 

hes old 

we have 2 wait 

4 some1 new 

how do u know

they might all be dead 

the what? 

yeah...i mean...what if ur some poor woman who is just too firtal for her own good

ewwww

omg hold on thats disgusting!!! 

lets get back on topic 

hahahahaha

omg i am fall ing on the floor laughting 

haha soryry 

ok so the church 

no
and yes 

but not really 

like

they are the female version of monks

 i feel like 

well...actually 

they are like decans 

they cant do the sacraments 

yeah that too 

yeah....like, what are we trying to prove about them? 

again? 

oh, how they are diff then priests 

they are like apples and oranges 

too diff 

not the same catagory 

i agree
