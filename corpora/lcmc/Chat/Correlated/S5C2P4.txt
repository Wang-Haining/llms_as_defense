yeah i agree with loco, if they put it out there is out there for th epublic to seee

your on sga

what was found on faceboook 

that got them kicked out 

oooh

now, if you have privacy as only friends can see your profile 

how does the administration see it 

they have fb accounts

i dont think its like searching through a bag at all 

your posting pictures to get attention 

and you ggot the attention, just not the way u wanted 

i think its good they have that rule 

there are too many dirtbags 

gets rid of them 

then you shouldnt post it if your worried 

i dont think they care that much 

but if your posting pics of stuff u shouldnt be doing 

its just like throwing in their face 

it*

are u talking about stuff on york road? 

i dont think they would file judicial action against u for that 

like 

its a loyola network 

yes

exactly 

how?

more so on myspace 

yeah i agree 

they have to be relative to the case 

no

wait A

so this guy wrote about murders he committed? 

bc of the book? 

the murderers said they did it bc of the book 

i think theyy might question him bc of the similarity 

yeah 

or if there was anyone that paid special interest in his book 

haha loco you have added so much excitement to our group

theres a lot of llifetime movies where people install cameras into apartments they rent 

yeah me too 

sometimes our privacy needs to be invaded for safety

i dont feel like my privacy is being invaded 

me? 

i think anything u say online can somehow be hacked into 

i think the only private conversations are bw you and another person 
creeeepy 

theres no privacy on the internet 

public bc its bein used for a study 

that were getting paid for 

did we? 

i signed whatever form to participate in the study 

so

no

this is public 

melissa is listening 

nicole is 

people can judge all they want 

thats so creepy 

im getting paid 

and you don’t

all we need to do is find out who started a forum last year

and then we know goigdonny 

i bought my comp from the school 

mine is still under another persons name

im fine with it 

i have nnothing to hide 

thats gross 

there are so many phonesex ads on our tv

who does get tapped

and who listens to all of the recordings
