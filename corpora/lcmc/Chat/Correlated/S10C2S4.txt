that sounds messed up using women as a front 

its extra degrading

gotya, i understand that completely my mother does that, it works 

equal pay for equal work that is always a good start 

everything should be 

equal 

i think that is the only step 

that will be recognized 

yea i think our country has made great trides in what is really not a long time in the grand scheme of things 

i mean in 50 more years it could be equal 

is that too long 

yea its effects will always be present 

it is an evolving aspect of our society
