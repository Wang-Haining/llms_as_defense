i think its a little weird 

i think that its ok for people who are interviewing you for a job can do that but not your teachers 

yeah

so u cant say like no you can do that 

cant

right

they dont have to but those pictures up 

however i dont think facebook should be used to gather a first impression of someone 

right thats why teachers shouldnt go on to get a first impression 

i dont think its any of the teachers business and i dont know why they would want to look except to be nosey but its their right 

right

yeah

i guess if i was a teacher i would probably look too because i ammmm nosey 

true

seeing that some kids do drink heavily on the weekends may effect how the teacher views them and grades them 

very true 

yeah 

no, but they most likely will 

yeah 

i think more students should kno bout this though 

because i think they put up pictures on facebook like its nothing not knowing that they now belong to facebook 

it shhhhooooulld b that way, but it wont 

me neither!

which i think is kind of creepy 

seriously

they even say after you delete your proifile, the pictures still belong to mark wwhatever his last name is 

lol

too much almost 

its going to be funny if this facebook guy wants to use these pictures as blackmail when we all become famous lol 

that will be an interesting case 

when it comes to national security, i think the gov has to do what they have to do 

right 

its their job 

exactly

especially if it could lead to something as horrible as 9/11 

we always agree lol 

yupppp

sorry!

which kid? 

Ooooooo

wait i didnt hear this 

did i? 

the kid who said he was gonna bring a gun to school? 

o ok 

well its good that they stopped it 

well, technically it was an invasion, but for a valid reason 

but if youre going to post something like that on myspace i guess youre looking for an invasion of privacy 

its his private thoughts no matter what, making it an invasion, but in this case it was justified 

and if you dont want your privacy to be invaded you probably shouldnt post it on the internet 

lol

yea, exactly 

he couldnt have intended for it to be private 

anyone can access a myspace 

well, if he tried to use invasion of privacy in his defense i guess he was somewhat justified because they read what he posted, but i think hes using that as an excuse

i cant imagine he would post something on myspace and not expect it to get read 

especially something like that 

thats true 
i guess it depends how he "posted" it, if it was public then im not sure it counts as being private 

i dont know a lot about myspace 

i dont know a lot about myspace 

but wait 

can people youre not friends with access your myspace page? 

oh then nevermind

i thought it was like facebook 

yeah, his friends def should have contacted someone 

its not invasion if they were contacted, it would be invasion maybe if they thought he seemed suspicious and then hacked into it 

without anyone contacting them 

yeah

yes i think so 

but i doubt they would be stupid enough to post threatening things after getting caught 

i dont think thats invasion 

aha thats true 
it shouldnt be invasion of privacy if they were conviced, after that pretty much everything you do should be monitered in a sense 

yeah

for example if they read what he said to his friend and he said something like: hey i hate english i could kill my teacher 

or something 

idk if that makes sense 

teenagers tend to use slang that could be considered more dangerous than they mean it to be 

i guess is my point 

yeah exactly 

yeah 

yeah and once they have something on their record they tend to be assumed guilty 

yeah, thats fair 

kind of like how you cant say bomb on an airplane anymore 

teenagers need to curb what they say 

no

thats not invasion of privacy 

if your friend is in trouble you have every right to try to help them 

no

aha

EOOO 

WOO*

esp myspace 

yeah i dont really agree with schools that check kids backpacks every morning when they come in 

a lot of high schools do 

especially after columbine 

well, it happens more in public schools especially in bad areas 

and kids that had things like swiss army knives in their bags werent nescessarily going to use them to kill their peers 

i think they should only check lockers tho if they have a reason 

yeah 

there was a boy in our brother high school that fixed peoples ipods 

and he had one in his locker that was reported stolen 

and he got kicked out 

stuff like that isnt fair 

yeah thats true 

and also you hear about people "planting" things 

and then no one really knows who to believe

exactly

yeah thats how it was at my school 

we had to use locks they provided 

and they had all the combos 

yeah, but at the same time they shouldnt be allowed to check your things unless someone reports that they heard something bad or saw you with something 

yeah, thats true they tend to blame everyone for something 2% of the population of students would even consider doing
