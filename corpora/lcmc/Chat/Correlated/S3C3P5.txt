it's kind of weird but they're within their rights 

right, if its public, you dont get to choose who can and can't look 

true 

but thats a personal choice 

well you can post pics of yourself being normal too 

haha

oh baby 

thats true 

and KNOW that the kids they're looking at aren't like that all the time 

thats true 

why would they want to see that? 

Haha

ok, so all the kids in your class go out once in a while on the weekend

does that affect how you treat or grade them? 

yeah lol 

everyone gets warned a LOT on entering college that teachers and admins may look at your profile, and to be careful 

well, at least we get fair warning about it

well i don't know how anal they really are 

so far i've only had one professor who actually went on and looked 

(at least that i know of... lol)

yeah, same 

haha yeah 

it's not worth it, they don't want to do that to us 

i think dah is right, it's more of a nosiness thing 

yeahhh... i didn't knwo the guy could keep all your pictures

employers should only look at the things that would affect work performance - if what kids do in pictures doesn't affect their school performance, it won't affect them at work 

hahaha 

i learn so much here... 

lol 

so weird... 

if it were publicly posted and not in an email or something, the police should have every right to act 
well yeah, a lot of threats like that aren't serious, but if its been made by someone they've been watching for a while they should investigate 

yeah

i know lol 

it makes for some bad chats 

haha

hahahaha

look what we've been driven to!

well they dont 

do they? 

i think your right haha 

hahah

so uhh... how bout that kid who got screwed over by myspace? 

hahaha 

seriously? 

the kid who posted a threat bulletin 

the one in this question 
lol 

nah 

just good old classic cmc 

the kid who posted a threat in a myspace bulletin and his school officials found it and prevented him from carrying it out 

yep

yeah 

thats just a kid fishing for a defense for a stupid action 

how was it an invasion? 

i guess i just dont think he really intended it to be private

yeah

i mean, any of his friends could have been freaked out by it and showed it to officials... they wouldn't have necessarily even had to go looking 

ohh ok 

a bulletin shows up to every single person you're friends with 

and thats what he posted 

yeah lol 

i think so 

yep 

yes

they can 

nah, myspace is sketch 

u can turn it to private tho 

yes, yes it is 

haha 

i bet there was some sort of incident that preceded it that made officials suspicious 

otherwise they probably wouldn't have even taken the threat seriously 

yes

if they do, it should be monitored 

yeah 

they already have a lot of their privacy rights revoked... myspace should be on that list 

thats true 

it all needs to be taken in context 

sadly, yeah 

yeah... 

i still have friends threaten to shoot me in the face on a regular basis lol

i would hate it if they got arrested for it 

nooooo

dont they tell you to do that? 

if you think a friend has a problem, bet help 

get*

haha well we learned that in health

right, you were just trying to help 

not spreading it around the internet or something 

not at all 

we've been talking about this for quite a while lol 

arrrrgh 

too much burning

ok so: privacy! 

thats a good thing 

myspace sucks 

anddddd.... dont post stuff on the internet unless you want people to see it 

i think anything that comes into school is no longer private 

internet privacy is a different story 

well thats ridiculous 

wow

i meant like if they were tipped off, they should have the right to do a search 

sheesh tho 

yeah 

aaaaaaahahahahaha

good one lol 

hahaha

absolutely

eww

thats such an overreaction 

aww

thats true 

at least if they're going to enforce their own punishments there should be a thorogh investigation 

but i mean, you shouldnt really bring anything to school you could get in trouble for 

yeah 

they should be more lenient then 

thats true 

punishments should be specific to crime and offender
