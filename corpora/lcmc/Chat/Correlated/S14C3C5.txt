yeah that part of the exhortation really surprised me 

they cant accept that some times divorce really is the better option

well how would they tell unless you made it known 

i mean if you didnt get remarried in the same church, they have no way of knowing 

half the congregation is right 

they cant accept progressivism because theyre so rooted in tradition

and therefore cant effectively deal with issues like divorce or contraceptives

of course theyre picking up copious amounts of churchgoers abroad

i understand what they are trying to do, and the stance they take isnt wrong, but its not effective or an absolute 

heres a big question 

if god is the ultimate judgement, why is the church allowed to decide which sinners can take communion and accept the blood and body of jesus christ? 

its not the popes place to say 
he can take a stance on it, but he cant condemn a certain group of sinners just because 

now if its something like celibate male priests, thats something that i think the pope has authority over 

i might disagree, but its not my place to undermine the popes decision

? 

thats true 

government

now i know we have deacons in my church, but what role do they play in the catholic church? 

Ok

i honestly dont care, but i would argue that females should not be allowed to be priests 

i would say that since eve committed the original sin and caused adam to sin too, we shouldnt let them in positions of power anymore 

also

women have wombs 

which are for having babies 

how can they have babies if theyre celibate 

yeah but if she wasnt there egging him on, he would have never sinned 

or maybe women are manipulative and greedy and therefore would abuse the powers of priesthood 

basically women are on earth to a) serve men and b) have babies 

would someone prove to me that women should be allowed to be priests

cuz im not seeing any evidence 

civil liberties are laws allowed by government, not by church 

i agree they should be equal in the eyes of law, but by the church?

i think the bible has different messages for women and men

so once we get a young, dashing, hunk of a pope--maybe theyll start to change 

what reassurance do you have that a new pope (elected remember, by a group of really old priests stuck in the old ways) will change things?

no they want 

wont

they like being stuck in the old ways 

they like being "old-fashioned" because that means they still have all the power 

good luck dreaming 

i have a problem with the contraceptives issue in the church

we were talking about old people 

i thought we should get back on topic 
its long been my opinion that abstinence policy doesnt work 

its the same with drug policy...a policy of zero tolerance never works ever 

why must every sperm be saved? 

do we really want that many babies? 

me neither 

we can give them to the poor

to eat 

jonathan swift may be lost on this group lol 

church church church 

who needs it 

its an unfair comparison 

yeah i feel like the point about nuns being the female version of monks is the best point 

i think the best thing to say is 

if we are to compare nuns we should compare them with monks, and the fact that there is no female equivalency to priests is the biggest issue of gender discrimination 

i really have nothing to say following that
