it has gone on too long 

it's been 4 years 

and the President just announce in January that he plans to send 21, 500 more troops to Iraq 

so, you think in 2003, it was a good idea to invade Iraq? 

but it does make a lot of mistakes 

and I think that Iraq is one of them 

I think there was faulty rationale for the war to begin with 

wasn't one of the main reasons for war the claim that Saddam was hiding weapons of mass destruction? 

and did we ever find any? no 

but who do we know for sure has them?North Korea 

but have we invaded them? 

No

who was seeking our aide? 

the US has a thing for going in unprepared and following a policy of escalation 

there are people suffering everywhere 

how can you pick and choose which people to save? 

you don't think it's possible that there were alterior motives? 

oil? 

we didn't have the resources for this war 

Bush didn't send nearly enough troops to begin with, he didn't plan effectively for the power vaccuum that erupted once the leader of Iraq was deposed 

all the looting and general chaos that took place once the US removed Saddam from power 

you think some knowledge of history would help, Vietnam perhaps 

you think we would learn from our previous mistakes 

so you approve of pre-emptive strikes 

but did they actually make an informed decision? 

they lied about having proof of weapons of mass destruction 

who, me? 

what do you mean? 

well, we're taking that risk with North Korea 

a country that we actually know has nuclear weapons 

and has threatened to use them 

so then why not political action with Iraq

don't you think it may have had something to do with the political rhetoric of 9/11? 

i wonder if women would be part of a new draft

to comment on Dr. Sabin's point 

do you feel that a draft is ever acceptable? 

what do mean, "existence as a nation"? 

oh okay 

but can anyone really know when a war needs to be fought 

i see, so in defense of the country 

so, was Bush fighting terrorists by invading Iraq? 

the terrorist behind 9/11? 

terrorists, i meant to say 

and what terrorist group was in Iraq? 

what do you mean? 

so i'm trying to figure out what terrorists they were 

and if the US found them 

them? 

right, but my question is this, is the war in Iraq a fight against terrorist organizations, because that is what it seems to me that you are saying 

my argument is that the war in Iraq was not fighting terrorism 

besides, the US can't fight terrorism on its own 

allies i meant to say 

Bush said we went to war in Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein, to free the Iraqi people, it was called Operation Iraqi freedom 

phase out the troops 

how can what has happened so far be deemed a victory for us? 

concerning the state of Iraq today, the US soldiers who have fought there, what is victorious about it?

which are? 

yet insurgency and terorrism still plagues Iraq 

every day, the news reports car bomings and suicide bombers 

yet the government was not prepared for it to last even this past 4 years

how many stories have you heard of weapons shortages 

mtnbike said that no one should this war could end in just 4 years, if i have that right 

and I agree with him 

what i'm saying, is that the goverment knowing this, did not adequately prepare for a war of that length 

which can be seen in the weapons shortages 

in the strains that have been put on army medical facilities

i'm saying that U.S. should be more prepared next time it decides to invade a country 

yes, the U.S. went directly against the will of the UN 

that was not smart 

so the UN doesn't matter? 

so it should be dissolved? 

the force from the UN comes from its member countries cooperation 

obviously if the U.S. doesn't cooperate, as with Iraq, the UN becomes weaker 

so what kind of example is the US setting? 

a peace-keeping one 

that's its purpose anyway 

so, should the UN be dissolved? 

so the US should push democracy on everyone? 

i don't you realize how bad it is now 

than why just Iraqis

so who is next? 

exactly, how do you go about making that decision 

how does anyone 

even the president 

does he even have that right 

doesnt the U.S. have enough internal problems to deal with?

shouldn't we fix ouselves before we go fixing other countries 

maybe the world doesnt want our help 

did you ever think about that> 

which is... 

but Iraqis didn't choose 

and why is it our duty 

they still didnt ask us to come in
are we really the strongest nation 

maybe we're just a big bully 

we're so afraid of what other countries will do 

with weapons of mass destruction and stuff 

yet we are the only nation that has every actually used nuclear weapons 

don't you see the irony 

if anyone should be afraid, it's other countries, of us 

did outside forces impose democracy on America?

so then why would we impose it on Iraq?

they didnt what? 

that's what a democracy is all about 

quest 

didnt mean to type that 

yes, why would i say we didnt? 

i'm talking about when we first achieved independence 

i would argue that the informed people aren't so bright 

ok
