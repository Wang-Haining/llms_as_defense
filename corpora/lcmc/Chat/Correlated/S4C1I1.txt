while i do think it has gone on too long, i don't think its fair to look in the past to justify our opinions now 

hindsight is 20/20 

the U.S. governmentt is not some evil organization 

but i'm sure they'd be able to do a better job than you or me 

we thought he was 

you cant compare apples to oranges 

we dont have the resources 

and again, we dont have teh resources 

we only have so many troops 

so obviously we cant have a military presence everywhere 

hindsight is 20/20 

great 

well..you can always look back and see how something should have been done, but at the time, you don't know how something will turn out 

for example, what if the us had not taken military action, and saddam launched missiles at israel? 

then we'd be saying bush was irresponsible for not taking action 

i approve of teh decision makers making informed decisions

of course they did, that is their job 

should they call you in for strategical decisions? 

Yup

you do what you can with the intelligence you have 

exactly

International politics is a complex business 

cause iraq didnt have a nuclear program 

if they did draft women, they wouldn't be deployed to combat operations 

sure, if the us is fighting for existence as a nation 

in a defensive position 

in think in this day and age, a draft is unlikely because of the nature of the enemy 

which is not a cohesive force 

in terms of industrial capabilities etc 

terrorist organizations do not have a nation of their own 

and they dont really have a military per se 

Sorry about that 

yes - and saddam 

right on

but we have to resist them 

the terrorist organizations 

why not? 

not effective ones 

leadership is not a quality that all people possess 

then what was it fighting? 

there can be more than a few objectives 

so no one needs to plan the logistics of an attack? 

so then should we pull out altogether? 

wont that be a victory in the eyes of terrorists? 

this issue is not as simple as people make it out to be 

i agree 

removing saddam 

i just think we should allow the joint chiefs - who have all the intelligence info - to make the decisions 


so should we let ordinary folk make decisions 

? 

ok, but how do you suggest we prepare ourselves? 

the UN doesnt really take action 

it just kinda waves its finger at things 

in short, no they dont 

its more of a figure of unity - its not a powerful entity 

its not about setting an example 

yeah, i dont think you realize how bad saddam's regime was? 

so are we all doomed? 

we can do more than one thing at a time 

because were the strongest nation in the world 

sadamm has used chemical WMDs on the kurds 

just not nuclear 

i just think it not our place to question the decision makers 

Let the informed people make informed decisions
