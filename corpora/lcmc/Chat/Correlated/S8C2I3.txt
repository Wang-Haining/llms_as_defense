gone on too long i must say 

but there's nothing we can really do about that at this point

i agree with that 

but we do know that we went in there with very little and very unreliable information and look where it's put

i always felt that it was some part of the bush administrations imperialistic agenda 

but what are they doing over there at the current moment? more and more deaths and nothing is getting done 

the place has been left more torn apart than it was before

thats like trying to fit the circular block in the square hole

not at all 

its like peas and ice cream 

it doesnt taste good 

maybe not never, but its not as easy as our government seems to think 

i feel that bush thinks that firepower is a safe answer to everything

just because we have the most powerful army, doesnt mean we can get 2 sides to get along 

not just bush, his administration 

its more or less cheyney 

except they didnt 

congress never declared war 

nobody

bush is the commander and chief 

he can send troops whereever he wants 

well not entirely 

to declare war 

i agree, but it was never officially "warified" 

so

its tough to say 

i dont think we should have been there 

but now we're in a little snafoo 

so its kinda tough to say 

at least the government under saddam was stable 

sure i dont agree with his actions 
but there is more than one way that you can go about taking care of it 

it was more stable than everybody killing everybody 

now its one step above anarchy 

you put 3 groups who want to kill each other in an arena with no rules 

well now you've got a big problem 

6 about 

or wait 

oh wait 

yeah 

my bad 

thats a pretty large number 

it was somewhere that i heard that at the rate we are going there might not be an iraq in several some years 

once we leave, their new government could possibly fall 

then they would be vulnerable to countries like Iran 

no

but whatever we do set up 

who fight who? 

history of conflict 

canadian army

OH SNAP 

while on fox news and some other news channels you hear that many iraqi civilians love us, there are still a very good amount that hate us

and will try to stop us from achieving our goal 

but in a country that is so used to a dictator and has overbearing cultural "rules" they arent going to want the government that we are trying to put in place 

if we want to get anything done we shouldnt turn ourselves into the enemy

but many of them do 


dont forget, it's THEIR country 

not ours 

they arent going to be so easily accepting of our actions 

especially since many of them were loyal to saddam 

dangerous

exactly
and when you try to force that day to come it only makes matters worse

which isn't by going in there and tearing their home apart 

i didnt mean literal homes 

but our presense hasnt done much to help solve that 

we're trying to set up a pro-american democracy 

in a place that is so used to this dictatorship 

and with your islamic fundimentalists 

and all of that jazz, it's not going to play out very easily

im not saying give up 

im saying that we're going about it the wrong way 

i couldnt tell you 

because its obvious that it wont work 

i said it before, they' 

e trying to fit the circular block in the square hole 

nobody wants to 

but still, that doesnt change the fact that there is way too much internal conflict for us to go about this the way we have been 
not never 

but it will take a while 

and it wont just take democracy and a bag of candy 

not just different people, but different people who want to kill each other

but its only making matters worse 

we may have officially torn apart a country

not intentially 

as inspiring as that is, it wont work 

how do you think we can solve this issue?

800+ years of war 

and one person is going to rise up and change it? 

people who try are killed 

or being hung 

its an army 

but its like stepping on an anthill to get them to agree 

it just agitates them 

civil war is not allowing the government to be put in place 
agree

its fear tactics to get us to support it 

the whole "war on terror" bullshit 

its not even a matter of where you watch it 

the information that they are given is given in some sort of biased way 

its all about how they manipulate it though 

exactly 

but just the fact that they call it "a war on terror" and how in speaches you hear talk of terrorism

we are always given this image of the 2 towers falling, every day 

to hand us fear that it might happen again 

international sources are always better

they actually care about coverage 

for international affair

papers here are too busy with internal things 

i get all my information from the intraweb 

britney spears shaved her head OMG! 
(btw that was because she was going to get drug tested) 

we shouldnt 

fun to read about but when people let it distract them from what is actually going on, their minds become vulnerable to manipulation and they will believe anything that Fox News or something like that says 

not saying that its always the case but it happens 

yes he did 

what is it? fat stupid and lazy 

someone described it something like that 

no, not just americans 

but any nation that becomes too powerful 

key word!

AFGHANISTAN

otice how it took a couple weeks to find saddam who has pleanty of look alikes but we still havent found osama

whys that 

we created him

or dead 
i wouldnt doubt it 

but its the thought behind it 

who we originally went in to get 

and who we actually found 

2 different countries 

cause we're cool 

we did, but we magically shifted into iraq 

osama was like a magical carpet for the bush administration to get the troops in iraq 

EXACTLY! 

who knows 

they didnt have that much power before hand 

even with WMD's they still didnt even have close to the amount of firepower as we did 

danger yes, chances of using their power, slim 

even a dictator that tyranical knows when to draw the line between having his whole country destroyed and not 

iran is a big bag of we hate america 

i know, just trying to be general 

perhaps i should have worded it that way instead 

hey give me a break here 

i said something i didnt want to say 

damn

im not sure about that one 

hell no 

pulling out is just going to make everything worse 

we need to change our tactics 

im no general 

so i cant tell you that 

but the way things are going 

aint gonna work 

or desert 

peace a cake 

hahahaha

think this has been the official end to our conversation 
or not 

-7 

7 

negative 7

alright guys 

iraq

its a not so fun place to be in right now 

but those who are there cant really leave without generating more problems 

hopefully with the democratic take over we will see a difference

no offense to any republicans in this room, but the repubs havent done a very good job so far 

i consider myself independent, but if i had to choose any side id go dem 

fetus

but isnt christianity about foregiveness? 

Exactly

so why does one person have more of a need to die than another 

its debate 
alright!
