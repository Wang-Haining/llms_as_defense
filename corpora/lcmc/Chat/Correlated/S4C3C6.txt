They still hold the view that if one is not baptized, he or she is not saved

Anyone who isnt Catholic 

By claiming that if you dont get baptized, you dont go to heaven

Plus, who knows what it takes to get to heaven

It makes claims based on nothing 

Yet they claim to know everything there is to know 

Thats correct 

Why do we need an institution to dictate our spiritual lives

I think an individual's relationship with God is an individual thing 

not a communal thing I'm not saying thst's ok, but... 

But what authority does the Bible have? 

How do you know that? 

I mean, look at all the priests who have molested young boys

 I think the church is reluctant to change because that would be a sign of weakness

Changing their doctrines that they hold so closely 

Seems to me like the church is practicing gender discrimination
What is the church's reason for not allowing women to be priest?


Why not? 

This is what I mean when I say the church creates doctrines out of thin air and call it fact 

Protestant religions allow priests to marry 


and that seems to work 

Thats interesting 

makes sense 

Like I said before, the church doesnt want to change because it would make them look weak 

Like I said before, the church doesnt want to change because it would make them look weak 

makes no sense not to change 

Whats the deal with all the priests molesting boys? 

I dont understand how there can be so many 

And those are just the cases we know of 

true, but you cant deny the fact that theres a strong correlation
its just another example of how the church is a contrived oraganization - how can they say that priests are God's mediators when they commit such horrible crimes

People should stop accepting the Church's excuses and not be afraid of opposing it 

agreed 

Thats exactly what I think 

seems to be the case 

yeah
