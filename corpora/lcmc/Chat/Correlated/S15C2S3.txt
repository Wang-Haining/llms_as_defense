no prob 

well, they shouldn't but the govt feels sorry for treating them like crap most of the time 

no i agree 

I agree with sun_beauty 

but then again....i also think that the whole field should just be equaled out 

so that one does not have to worry about males or females having an easier time thean the other 

well if u think about it...non white men and women are often treated the same 

so the real issue is not really about the money,....it is about the treatment of different races and genders verses the typical white male 

yeah you cant force it 

b/c then people only meet it with resistance 

and if it is met with resistance...then it is still not really equal 

well....for one thing, instead of giving certain people the edge or not 

you should just not have to tell if ur not a white male or if u are 

and then companies would be based on themselves....not by who runs them

that is a great hope.....but i fear that would ever happen 

b/c people are always going to have egos 

hopefully....but again, everyone has some sort of an ego 

hummmm it might not be the right word....let me think 

haha i feel like we are talking about sigmund froid.....(sp?)

bias....yeah that sounds close enough for what i am trying to say right now 

like you always feel as if you can do someting better than someone 

yeah....thats what i was trying to say earlier about not looking at who owned the companines 

ummm...the vote? 

better make sure u make that distinction next time

no

and they did back when the vote came about 

and women first started to break into the workforce 

but feminists now i feel have drastically changed 

and i do agree....now they just seem to hate men b/c they can

not very logical 

how would the planet continue
in buiness there is the glass ciling a lot of the time 

yeah....i was going to say 

that is considered acceptable for woman 

but if u go into the corperate world 

not everyone is ready to accept them in high places 

hahaha boys 

very funny 

at least ur job is to take out the garbage 

making money is fine....thats not the prob

women should just be paid just as much as men for doing the same job 

but ur brain is a lot of empty space 

lol

haha, thanks sun beauty 

yeah

diff pay....that should be fixed 

unfortunatly yes 

oh really frankie? you dont think that is a good first date topic? A

haha

yes

yeah

i thought they werent supposed to get money unless they were filing chaper 11 anyways 

or something like that....like s a last push to get them back on thier feet 

its what K-Mart had to file for 

really? like other than tax refunds and charity acts 

haha, not sure about chaptes 1-10 

oh...ok 

yeah

if somone is handing u mone 

money*

why would u not accept it 

unless there was some catch attaced to it

yeah, but most of the time....it is appealing 
i agree 

b/c then it is like...oh we will higer more women to get more moeny from the govt, but still pay them less and we get the best end of both deasl 

deals*

haha i thought we agreed on that last week 

not that i can think of 

i actually deff agree with that 

b/c then it is like they are asking to be treated less

sounds good
