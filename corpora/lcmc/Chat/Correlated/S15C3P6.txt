woo, last topic! 

(to answer frankie, yes i believe so)...as to this topic 

it depends how they use it 

like if they suspect someone.....then i think it is ok to monitor them, but i mean....otherwise it is a drastic invasion of privacey 

like...i would not really care if some govt official listened in to my convo to my mom or someting 

but like.....i would not like it if it happened all the time 

but then i was going to say 

how could you ever know that a 2 person convo is really a 2 person convo without a third listener 

i think i would hate it if i realized they were listening to me 

but we know it 

and agree to it 

very true 

but again,...it is a good point 

we know about this specific monitoring, vs. when they do it on our phones without telling us or our permission 

yes
it does 

usu

no idea 

b/c i feel as soon as someone knows they are being monitored...if they are bad,...obv they are not going to do anything or say anything to incriminate themselves 

so i guesss what i am saying is that 

if it is an extreem possibility that someone is up to no good it is ok...otherwise not so much 

i think so kinda 

right?

livingdeadbeat?

i know sun_beauty is prob singing 

but whats ur excuse?

Lol

ok, well it looks like it is just you and me frankie 

so....now what should we talk about? 

Haha

yeah what about it? 

oh.....well, i mean if u put it up there for others to see 

i agree 

well....i mean just make sure ur pricavy settings are how you want them 

exactly

then all should be goo

i refuse to have a myspace for that reason 

yeah

its a channell right? 

True

i dont know 

i dont really think there is much of a prob with aim convos and other people "reading them" is there? 

really?

never really thought about it 

true

but what if someone else was on ur comp 

on ur Aim name 

it is still pretty hard to prove 

no...you might not know 

what if it is just on ur desk and ur out of the room 

and the door was left open

and someone came in and got on ur comp and u happened to be on aim

and thus they used it 

but i am sure there is some lawer out there who would defend you trying to make a name for himself 

well fingerprints.....like if it did really happen there would be many diff fingerprings and oils from your skin on the keys

true

yeah were pretty much screwd 

sure it does violate them 

b/c we didn't give permission 

so thus a violatoin 

i dont think i understand the quote...why would they not deserve liberty or safty? 

if they made a compromise? 

why would they get neither though?

 why?

what is the reasonig behind that quote? 

well eyah 

that i agree with 

nothing 

ok, so i understand the quote now...sorry took me a moment 

well robots then 

dont know what i am trying to say 

lol 

haha ok 

yeah yeah haha 

ok,...so can i pull a sun beauty and didapear for a moment and pretend that i need to go sing...or pull a livingdeadbeat and pretend that i am getting distracted for a few moments 

haha sorry...i am soo board...we keep talking in circles 

and i need to go to work 

kinda soon
