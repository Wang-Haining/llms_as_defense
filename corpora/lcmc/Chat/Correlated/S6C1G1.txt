i don't have any problems with it. 

? 

well, my thing is this: a marriage license is something you apply for from the government. it's a completely secular process. i don't see any reason for them to change the wording, unless they're going to change it for everyone. churches are completely free to have a different definition for marriage if they want (most people have different definitions for things than the government anyway).

haha, sho nuff 

right, but that's a religious definition. when the government recognizes a person's marriage with a license, though, that's different 

i'm a catholic too, but my problem with not calling it a marriage is that the semantics involved seem to imply that it's a second-rate institution, which isn't fair 

the words we use for something make a big difference in people's perceptions of a thing 

true too 

i think that when you argue that we should postpone giving them those same rights, even if only in a semantic sense, you're marginalizing them

easing tensions is fine, but people argued that easing tensions was a good reason for postponing civil rights in the 60s, too

well, at the end of the day, the churches aren't the ones passing legislation, though 
well, yes, that'd be fine; my problem would be with the government using two different terms, which encourages marginalization 

well, "churches", plural 

yeah, that would be acceptable 

i think it's a stupid political contrivance to galvanize the republican base 

i think it's another karl rove-esque political move. the administration only cares about it as a point of leverage to garner support 

i would disagree with the statement that our gov't is based on religion, too 

most of the founding fathers were deists, and if you read their personal writings closely they favored a secular veiw of a democratic republican system 

right, and amendments are generally reserved for serious constitutional changes, not legislative stunts 

yeah, i have a gay cousin and a few gay friends 

well, most of them want to be able to get married in my experience, obviously 

yep

from a legal and governmental perspective, i'd go for it 

i think that right now the issue isn't being given a fair shake as an issue in itself, though; it's being used as a social wedge. politicians are using it more as a tool to divide and conquer 

well, look at the last presidential elections (gimme a minute) 

in a few midwestern states, local republican party members lobbied to have a gay marriage referendum on the ballot; in the states where that happened, that encouraged a larger portion of voters to turn out to vote against the referendum. that's what many really were encouraged to come to the polls by, and it just so happened that they also voted republican when it came to the candidates. that's an example of it being used as a political tool 

hahah, i think you're giving politicians too much credit when you say they don't change their minds. anybody follow hillary? 

Probably

she just gets made fun of a lot for flip-flopping 

yeah, pretty much as per her convenience 

yep

yeah, and i think that that's a social change that's happening right now 

(people becoming more sensitive about it, i mean) 

wait, which part

i don't really have any issues with it, to be honest. a lot of research seems to indicate that it's not a "lifestyle choice" so much as a genetic disposition.

well, no, but recent scientific research in animal groups indicates that it's a predisposition 

http://www.slate.com/id/2159262/ 

(that's an article about current gov't research involving gay sheep; they cause problems for farmers, since they don't breed, thus the research) 

right, but the general layout of their brains is basically the same as ours 

right, but we still have instinctual predispositions 

which dictate much of our conscious activity, like it or not 

i think that penguins in the LA zoo are kinda funny 

and yeah 

my cousin's been taunted in public a couple times 

yeah, that's kinda par for the course, methinks 

i went to a catholic high school too, but most of the anti-gay sentiment came from testosterone, not religion 

statistically, guys tend to react more negatively toward male same sex couples then girls do toward female same sex couples 

haha, true dat 

yeah.....yeah

i dunno, i know a lot girls who flipped for brokebakc mountain
