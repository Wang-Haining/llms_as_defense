Okay

what about it 

it seems like the states & feds need to get on the same page as far as legalization

hm 

i don't know about that hoops 

why should it be all or nothing 

that's not the only issue though 

its being "used" regardless of the legality, just to get high 

mm

i mean, i'd be all for general legalization, but i don't know if thats off-topic

exactly

it be even easier with the clinics too 

mm 

i think we 

'd all agree on that 

well i don't think they neccessarily need it, but itd be nice if they could use it 
cigarettes are a gateway drug 

alcohol is a gateway drug 

any drug is a "gateway" to something else 

why not 

ok, maybe 

but whats really wrong with getting high as opposed to getting drunk 

(im just playing devil's advocate) 

how we doing on length, nicole 

k

i don't see how that would do too much damage 

i think a lotttt of people would start smoking 

who are just worried about breaking the law 

that otherwise would be smokers 

hahaha 

thats probably the best point made so far, hoops 

haha 

i wouldn't think so 
haha i know 

lol 

yea but look at baseball, all those dudes mask their pee 

itd be a hell of a lot safer to buy, thats for sure 

there wouldn't be as many people in jail 

no one will ever know 

i don't think we're heading in that direction anytime soon 

alright!

is that a rap? 

Hmm

same stuff as alcohol 

21

well you'd be in troublee if youre drunk at work 

agreed as well 

i would say that and represent the company postively 

yea

well its not breaking the law (in our example) 

mm

haha good piont
