well aren't things such as affirmative action and the example in that story types of discrimination, even if they are aimed at helping a minority group? 

ok, yeah that's what i was trying to say 

thanks

i don't think that it is a thing of the past. i would say that it is not QUITE as big of an issue as it used to be, but it still exists

yeah i don't think that it will ever be possible to completely eliminate it 

in response to nicole's question about discrimination in jobs, i definitely think that there is 

for example, you always hear about the "glass ceiling" where women can look above and see the jobs that men hold but they can't reach that point 

i agree with rocks that these stereotypes exist 

but i also think that these stereotypes exist for a reason. while there might be SOME women who could be physically capable of doing certain jobs usually reserved for men, MOST women don't necessarily fit into that category 

ok, yes i do agree that you can't assume anything about a particular person

who?

me too 

i actually feel that that sort of situation comes up a lot (both in gender and racial discrimination) where if a certain person is chosen or not chosen regardless of gender or race, someone cites discrimination as the reason for it. when that is used as an excuse too often it becomes old. 

exactly...that's what i meant earlier.

yeah i think that it's pretty much been shown in studies that there exists a substantial difference between the salaries of men and women in the exact same positions and that, to me, is a problem. 

i DO agree with the higher the wage the bigger the gap

exactly rocks 

i think that this situation has been studied most often in a business situation , which is why that is a commonly cited example 

and it is also a situation where it has been shown to have been true, as ridiculous as it might seem 

yeah it's a difficult situation because there are certain occupations where salaries are more widely known, but once you start talking about upper level business positions, the salaries can become astronomical....and it's in those cases where it is difficult to control. 

(yeah sorry that was confusing, mine was in response to crashnburn's earlier question about how feasible changes would be) 

well do they have a reason for that policy? 

good points (crash and rocks) 

i'm not really sure what would work...it's a difficult situation because you don't want to advocate TOO much govenment intervention into the business world, but at the same time you need to have some sort of regulation to prevent unfair practices
