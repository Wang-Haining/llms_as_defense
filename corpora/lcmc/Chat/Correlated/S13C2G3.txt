i don't feel strongly either way. i'm definitely not opposed to it though. 

but i'm not a huge advocate either 

well to comment on that, they are not being denied LOVE....just the fact of a legal union of marriage 

yes...i believe so

haha

yes....and then you could run into the potential problem of two straight people of the same sex getting "married" for the tax perks that that could bring on 

(my "yes" was in response to goldeneye, not crashnburn's question fyi) 

well i know that today for spectrum week there was a speaker talking about the gay gene and it's social implications 

haha yes 

so i didn't go to it an don't know what exactly they said, but i feel that it is not a personal choice 

yeah goldeneye...especially if you go back father into history when it was SO much more socially unacceptable 

this is true 

so we are all in agreement that it is genetic for the purposes of future discussion? 

ok so then was was the question that someone brought up that depended on whether it was personal choice or genetic?? 

too bad it's happening right now 

i was going to go BUT... 

i'm here! 

well there are two different things....if you want to get married in a specific church (i'll use the catholic church as an example....but won't get too much into that now...save that for later!) you get married in the church and you ALSO need to get a legal marriage certificate

legally no

so yes rocks, the govt is needed in order to make it legal 

and provided those religions agree as well 

and the catholic church is not the only churcht that doesn't 

so in response to goldeneye's original question about whether teh govt has the right to decide, since they decide for heterosexual couples, then they must also be the ones to decide for homosexual couples 

no i don't think that anyone said that they are 

well how can they provide it without having made the decision to endorse it?

oh....ok i see now what you are saying 

but then what is the difference there between "deciding" and "providing the process"?

yeah i think so 

well my question is does it matter whether being gay is genetic or not? like would that affect whether we support gay marriage?? 

i agree with that goldeneye 

i HAVE heard of that before 

and i agree that if it is something genetic, then that is terrible 

if you don't work things out and instead just do what someone else tells you to, you might have feelings of regret, so i think that it's important for people to come to decisions about their sexual orientation on their own 

that's a very interesting question goldeneye 

so to bring back in the legal implications, if it is proven that there is a gay gene, should people need to be tested to see if they are "truly" gay before being allowed to marry? 

crash, do you mean that since they are handicapped they want to have handicapped children? 

haha
