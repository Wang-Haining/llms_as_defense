that reminds me, I need a sheet saying that I was in the study and what it entailed, can I get that from you 

oK

I don't see a reason to keep it illegal, so yeah, i agree 

I dont think you're giving people enough credit 

I think they would 

Its easier to obtain for some people than alcohol 

it's not really all that hard to get 

and people experience lifestyle problems, MAJOR ones from alcohol 

of course, but thats aNYTHING , anything out of moderation is bad

and I think people have enough restraint that for the majority it's not going to be a problem 

i think its become a "is pot really any different than alcohol" 

I also dont think everyone will just start smoking, i mean not everyone drinks, albiet many people do but still 

and for some people its the same with alcohol 

so does alcohol 

alcohol kills MAJOR brain cells 

yes 

yeah, it does 

yes brain cells dont regenerate 

once theyre dead theyre gone 

i dont know if i believe that 

but still, theres no reason for it to be illegal when we have things like cigarettes and alcohol

But how is marijuana smoking immoral? 

This is all of a sudden making me feel like Im watching reefer madness 

propoganda film 

i meant the original not the musicak 

tehy made a musical yeah 

no the original reefer madness was not a joke 

it was made as a film titled "Warn your children" 

that was shown at PTA meetings, and city halls 

Yet people STILL say marijuana is immoral 

and people believed it then 

and some believe it now 

what i want to know is How is marijana immoral 

and im sorry the government saying it isnt enough 

or a huge sex fiend 

no

Im not sure that made sense

i think there is NO reason for marijuana to remain illegal while alcohol is legal 

thats what it boils down to 

they're about the same, harm-wise 

we actually dont know that 

i stand behind my opinion 

there is no basis for the continuing status of illegality 

heh

yes i do melissa 

I think that its similar enough that having one legal and one illegal causes a mockery of our legal system 

Lovely
so do i 

it effects your brains perception of what is real, the levels of chemicals in the cerebellum trigger a hunger reflex 

as well as paranoia

so does alcohol, kills brain cells 

alcohol 

Yeah some people would, just like anything else 

like i said, i think you dont give people enough credit GBD 

i dont understand the moral part of it, there is nothing immoral about it

can we move on yet melissa? 

cause it seems we are pretty stagnant here 

ok 

actually

in amsterdam its now only legal if you've lived there for 2 years or more 

because it was the only reason people were going there 

im sure 

You can't buy it 

I'm not sure if you ,as a non resident, can smoke it anywhere

its legal in the canary islands 

so is that it then? 

i see that 

yes, absolutly 

and useless 

because the majority of people will use again
