Yep

Bleh

make bush go away..

i blame his administration, of which he's just a figurehead 

i think there needs to be a plan for a phased withdrawal 

the current negotiations seem to involve dividing the country into sections

yeah. that's kind of why it was dumb to go in in the first place 

i don't think it was a good decision, and i think the administration came into office with the intent to go to war in iraq 

not necessarily. the treasury secretary who quit said that there were talks of going into iraq prior to 9/11 

there would have been a lot of reasons for it, besides oil 

well, yeah, but more iraqis have died in the war than did by his hand 

i think the potentiality is there one way or another 

i think that's a big reason no politician has seriously proposed it 

i would never consider enlisting with an administration like the current one calling the shots 

i think re-instituting the draft to educate the public is extreme. that's basically sacrificing more lives in order to get a point across 

yeah, that was a very particular climate 

indeed

he draft, primarily. everybody knew somebody who was there 

and the reasons for being there were at least as hard to justify, and the death toll was much higher 

well, know, but people didn WANT to go, which is different 

and even now 

yeah, nobody's talking about going cold turkey at this point, though Mar

he US has tried to establish democracies in lots of places, and it virtually always fails. it just isn't pragmatic to enforce a system of government

right. there is now separation between church and state there. it just doesn't exist 

*no separation 

Sorry

it's an ethnic clash there, though, which is different 

yep

how do you mean? like know people who died? 

Same

yeah... 

i think it would be in turmoil one way or the other, to be honest. we're not going to suddenly eliminate the difference between shiites and sunnis 

we can't stay for an indefinite period, though

yep

haha...yeah... 

i really hope she doesn't get the nomination. i'd have to vote independent. 

well, the clinton's run a powerful political machine, so she weilds a lot of power no matter how crazy she is 

i dunno. she's hard to read; she doesn't actually have firm positions on anything 

they'll keep saying they do until they actually do 

almost definitely 

 i don't like any of the people who have declared so far 

hm....hair clogging the sink...good or bad? Go

thanks 

haha

hm...i think we need a phased withdrawal. and a definite one, not an ambiguous one 

yep 

indeed
