I cant see a reason why gay people should not be able to be married 

Definitely

religion aside, marriage is a ceremony in which a man and woman stand up in front of their friends and family and publicily say tht they love eachother. why not the same with two men or two women? 

Exactly

Same

Also if gay marraige was legal the goverment could tax them, and make more revenue.

i just think that this goes back to what we were talking about that the church needs to change. this would almost force them to think about changing their ways

same. there are some people who make terrible parents even though they are in a man woman couple 

exactly

yes besides artifical insemination 

yeah

well yeah but if it was the only way that they could have children 

straight couples use them if they cant have children 

yeah 

i think that if being gay was found to be biological there would be hard for the government to deny them rights 

they would be hard pressed too to accept gay marriage into their community but i still feel as though they would be hard to change 

but if it is something that cant be changed thats like saying you cant get married if your colorblind 

yes 

but the church doesnt say that you arent allowed to get married if you are born with only one hand 

well i dont know if we will ever change the church's mind on this issue, but if they are worried about losing following this issue, if legalized by the United States, could cause alot of problems 

and if we are going along with separation of church and state then the church should have no say in any government decisions 

so then its the govenments move and they should not take the church's feelings into consideration 

exactly
