im not used to this lack of reading a long paragraph of rules and stuff 

i think it is still present especially in the job field 

most businesses are run by old white men 

typical image of the CEO 

progress is being made but it still exists 

im sure everybody would say "equality

possibly

dont think ive seen one 

my dad used to be the one who made my lunch 

i think the fact that our society picks up on that is progress in and of itself

people used to watch that stuff and think that it was typical

agreed 

nurses

yeah, they're mean 

she did a really good job 

be are be 

bloody nose 

well i dont think men feel the need to wear bikinis anyway

relativly speaking 

hey thats your deal 

a good way to stop it would be for women to stop conforming to these standards, refuse to pose in certain pictures 

the problem is with stuff like even myspace, everybody wants to be a star 

half of my female friends there have taken a "half nude" shot

awkward silence 

ello? 

Yeah

s i said earlier, most CEO's are old white guys

 traditional values, see women as less 

i guess women in your town make bad pizza 

bad joke

thats just absurd though 

good example of discrimination though, they arent allowed to work there on one hand, and even if they did they would get stared down everyday (by the creeps working) 

guys should be allowed to work there as waiters 

i know many guys that can put on a skimpy outfit and rollerskate around delivering sodas and wingx 

wings

they need to stop applying at degrading restaurants 

no 

nope i dont 

ive been to hooters though 

are there any other positions there that she can have?

seriously, the wings are really good 

thats the only thing i go there for 

amen 

thats just ridiculousa 

thats because they promote it 

sure their job forces them to, but come on, hooters isnt the only restauraunt out there. even if you dont have the money dont give into the discrimination 

i thought they were trying for global domination 

hi melissa carbone 

alright

way to go donny 

anybody here? 

way to go 

So what would you guys say about gender discrmiination at loyola?

and how does that student body look/act/etc 

i disagree, i believe its present 

guys are supposed to conform to one standard and females to another

then how come on a friday night you see girls in a short skirt and revealing top walking outside in the middle of winter 

to go catch a cab for the bar 

and then guys take advantage of that 

still discrimination 

then how come girls dont wear really nice non-revealing clothing 

to the bar 

i like grapefruit 

IT IS TOPIC 

about that business front thing 

that does seem like they were just in it for the money 

like work at a place as discriminating as hooters 

sexism against white people? 

there we go! 

i think that its one thing to acknowledge that it exists and another to try and reverse the roles to fix it 

as much as i like the concept i cant say id support it, all that does is anger the old white men who hold the values that women are less

and then discrimination is only even furthered 

it creates tension rather than results 

gradual change 

which weve seen so far 

but it still hasnt made it to the place where it should be
we are a more tolerant generation than our parents and i think this will help

its a start though 

definatly is 

in order to take action on an issue you need to be aware of it 

ive seen statistics that show that they are 

i cant assure you where they are or their validity 

but i still think that it is pretty clear that there is a gap 

i dont know if it would exist on the loyola campus 

loyola unlike most schools is run by the jesuit institution 

that would have to play some role 

definatly across corporate america 

yes

meet the parents is a good example of that 

everybody laughs at the male nurse making him sad

i think that could be argued 

im hungry too 

boo im having fun 

can we do the other 4 in this same room? 

true, many people are raised with these images of the stay at home mom, go to work dad and all that jazz 

i think that we need to work for a change, but its not going to change completely any time soon 

as much as staying at home with the kids is fun, it doesnt payt he bills 

i hope he does 

my husband better do that for me 


except as of now its more of a "society tells me" choice 

part of society 

but that has only happened recently 

because people are becoming AWARE 

AWARENESS is now present 

to make fun of donny 

for talking about how cliche it is 

hahaha
