yes i completely agree with that statement 

and disagree with the sending of more troops 

i saw this thing on the news back when bush announced that he was sending over more people...... 

they had people watching his speech and rating how they felt about each thing that he was saying 

and when he announced that, everyone's ratings went down, supporters and opponents of the war 

yeah, it's supposed to be a democracy, but when the president acts against the people and even his own members, there is a problem 

i think that those stats have changed by now 

i definitely feel that bush played off of the fear of 9/11 and exploited that to some extend in iraq, which was unconnected 

well i think the war in afghanistan was justified....after 9/11, we had to do something 

but then bush's whole idea about why we should go into iraq was because of weapons o fmass destruction (which were never found) and people were more willing to accept bush' plan because of what had just happened in 9/11

terrorism fears were heightened, and that helped bush gain more supporters...i think .that's what i meant 

but there was no concrete evidence of WMD
this is true 

agreed

i'm just saying that if 9/11 HADN"T happened, i don't feel that there would have been nearly as many supporters originally 

well i think that since we've started something, we have a responsibility to finish it 

but i'd like to get out of there soon 

*as soon as possible 

no i don't think that we should send more troops...we need to wean ourselves out of there so that iraq can become more independent

but it's a VERY messy situation and i really don't know enough about it to know what our goals should be or how long it should take 

but they weren't clear from the beginning 

which is my issue with the start of the war 

i really have no idea goldeneye 

maybe

idk

economic BENEFITS? we are increasing the national debt immensely!

but we don't go in everywhere and try to impose democracy

alright

exactly

oh i'm sorry i misunderstood...i thought you were saying that that was a benefit of the war 

i was trying to say what rocks just said 

i forget who mentioned it before, but we're notreally seeing oil benefits yet. maybe that will come later? 

yeah i guess that makes sense that we can't really go taking it now 

but i don't really understand.....do you think that they will just GIVE us oil once they are stable? 

or we are just trying to form a good relationship with them...so that they feel they owe us for helping them out? 

like everyone cites oil saying that bush just wanted to go into iraq to get oil, but i don't quite understand how that would really play out 

yeah i don't know much either 

yes, that's my feeling 

we haven't even brought up the whole issue about the UN and how we went in without there support 

how do you guys feel about that? 

yeah 

no
