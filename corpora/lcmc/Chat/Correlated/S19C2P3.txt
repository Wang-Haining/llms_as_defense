definitely not, it's a public site 

okay yeah that's true, but at the same time you shouldn't put things up that you don't want to get in trouble for later 

well they can be 

if parents are concerned about their kids drinking or doing drugs it definitely is

if you don't want your parents to know your business don't post i up where anywhere can see it 

well if you're holding a beer can 

then why take a picture with it? 

okay so if someonw posts on your wall "yeah dude last weekend was so great we got sooo wasted" 

and your parents see that 

well i'm sure you'll have a really good defense whe you're confronted about it

well i don't think a school should be able to punish studnets for drugs or alcohol if it didn't happen on the school's campus 

hey thanks 

what i don't understand though is why you would post up your plans to shoot up a school where everyone can see it 

well if that's the case, then that's one thing, but if you really intended on carrying it out, that's just crazy 

well i have a situation that actually happened to my family that's kind of related to the phone thing and i definitely agree that its an invasion of privacy

sorry about ath 

what about e-mail? 

so are phone conversations 

a different story how? 

well before myspace, kids formed actual hate groups like on the playground so it's not really any different to put it on the internet, and kids are punished anyways for being mean to other students so i don't think it should be handled any differently 

happened to her you mean? 

i mean it's cruel, but that's how kids are 

they choose someone different to hate every week 

well the problem is nothing has happened at school yet 

i mean the students have done anything to her on school grounds

i don't either 


i agree i don't think the parents should be notified 

i know in my high school they blocked facebook and myspace because students would check them when they should be doing work, it seems like the best way to do things in order to avoid these situations 

yeah i'm pretty sure every high school keeps track of what sites students visit 

yeah i don't understand why you'd get on AIM during school anyways, aren't all your friends basically sitting next to you in class? 

well if the school can monitor that you've been on facebook or whatever site, they can monitor that too, and you can still get into trouble 

well not so much at my school, kinds kind of just went there to get out of class or study hall and hang out with their friends 

hence, why they'd get on aim and such 

yeah but i went to a public school with roughly 2000 students and they were too busy worring abour people "thrusting" at dances and stuff 

no they should, but ultimately it's up to the student 

yes

and the attendence police won't be an issue 

and that could be taking away from a student who actually needs to do work 

well i think that schools have a responsibilty to make sure you are safe during your free period, and that involves having some rules 
i know in my high school you weren't allowed to leave campus unles syou were a senior and had a certain gpa during free periods 

oh obviously not kids left all the time to go do drugs or whatever the hell else they wanted to do 

well you said not everyone would follow the rules and i was just giving an example, no issue 

agreed, schools should provide safe environments but they should also know their bounds
