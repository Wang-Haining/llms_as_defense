Haha

be are be, im gonna use the pottyhole 

kk 

public servers = no privacy at least to the stie owner 

basically, when you visit a website you are subjected to the same rights as in any private institution 

i doubt it 

you should run, youd probably win with your attitude though

yeah it would 

thats a bad idea 

i think that facebook evidence should not be used since facebook is not owned by loyola 

its kinda like them searching through one of your own personal bags

its the same reason why you dont have to open your backpack when you're walking in from jerrys or wine underground on a friday 

but its a privately owned website 

its up to the website to take action, not the school 

public to an extent, but unless it has malicious intent it should be kept private 
it can also screw you over 

but only certain people that you allow can view your profile 

and if you dont allow them, how can they have any right to view it?

sure, its public to an extent 

but what if the picture was taken off campus

why does the campus have any right to prosecute you for it 

fells point 

home

but what if i have a picture of me drinking at home with my friends from 3 years ago 

before i agreed 

and all of that jazz 

should the school have any right to take me down? 

im not trying to prove the whole privacy thing 

im just trying to make the water a bit darker 

there are so many things you have to worry about with the privacy issue

well, there are many lines that need to be drawn between what is invasion of privacy and what is not 

i mean ill agree to an extent that they do have some rights to look at your FB since it is public (if you leave it public to them) but there are also some things that they shouldnt be allowed to prosecute you on 

loyola is a private institution, not a government 

its a network that allows people from many schools to join

ts not run or funded by loyola 

i understand that 

its more of an issue with me of where they SHOULD draw the line

i understand their power 

what they are and arent allowed to do 

i guess when it all comes down to the wire im more or less arguing for a change in our society 

im just being an idealist here and a devils advocate 

i think instead of using facebook to bust us, they should use it to protect us 

school shootings, things of that nature 

because some idiots post that shit up there 

its happened with myspace and other public websites 

well we dont just have to talk about facebook 

afterall, this is a very open subject 

and we dont just have to focus on loyola and FB 

depending on what they are and their relativity

if you write up a hitlist and post it on a website, sure you should be taken in 

so wait, was the book published and then it happened? 

it could have just been some random guy who read it 

they would probably investigate 

thats a matter of separating fact from fiction 

if you put some kind of disclaimer nothing can happen 

well that wouldnt be the disclaimer 

that would just make it seem more suspicious 

but if he told the readers that all of the storys were based on fictional events

theres a fine line between an interesting read and being a crazed serial killer 

i would say no 

there are tons of storys out there about murder 
they would ask him if he knew anything about it 

im sure 

HEY

now if some guy wrote up a list and said "people who need to die" as the title, there might be a problem 

thats when its up to the judge to decide 

i could make a post saying "i hate matt damon" or something 

sure it can be interpreted as "i want to kill him" but then again...

thats where people have to draw the line 

not really 

its kinda sad 

or does he

unless you put them there yourself 

which doesnt seem like anybody would do that 

i think both are equally important 

while its nice to be able to be alone and do things that nobody else can know about... its also nice to not get shot everywhere 

privacy and security work in opposite ways 

if theres too much privacy people want more security 

as always 

private, but then again, to an extent 

did you know that every single email that you have ever sent in your life is saved somewhere on the internet? 

every website has your IP tracked 

each individual website is like a little privately owned facility 

all on loyola's server 

oh that one 

we all did 

i beleive 

but even in a public room we are able to maintain our privacy

i most definatly wouldnt 

it is on loyola's server 

and loyola's campus 

none of us know who any other one of us is 

therefore our privacy is maintained there 

well yeah 

if?

but i wouldnt do that because im respectful 

but still, we signed saying they could do that gobig 

they can 

since its public wires 

but 

its one step closer to totalitarianism 

to hold us down 

especially when it comes to iraq 

not trying to bring that up 

haha

but think about it 

wiretapping shortly after a major event like 911 

to root out the terrorists in the country 

fear as a tactic 
invading more privacy to produce fear 

YOUR NEIGHBOR COULD BE A TERRORIST 

WE MUST LISTEN TO YOUR PHONESEX HOTLINE TO FIND OUT

thats one area where i think they should avoid 

yeah, but its an example of someones privacy vs the government 

i think the real issue will arise when they stop listening and start taking action against people that they're not searching for 

they should have to have some kind of guidelines for what they can arrest you for when they tap 

if they say that its to root out the terrorists and then arrest you for trying to buy some weed, thats kinda not cool 

but they could 

hey havent but theyve induced this fear in everybody that they're listening in

now everybody is on edge 

well, not everybody 

well, not everybody 

but they should 

big brother is watching 
ill agree 

hahaha 

lol oops 

hahaha bad idea

you can talk to yourself for that long
