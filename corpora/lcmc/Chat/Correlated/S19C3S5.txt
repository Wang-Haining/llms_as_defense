that's true, but if a man and a woman go up for the same position and are equally qualified who do you think would get the job?

especially if its a high rankig position 

do you think a woman president would get the same respect as a man? 

what about from other countries who aren't as advanced in equality of woman? 

well there are a lot of countries who still see woman as inferior, and a woman president would have to do business with these countries, would they still respect her the way they respected all our other presidents?

it's just a question 

and also like engineering schools have far more men the women 

yeah it's due to the fact that theres more men in the field

yeah i dont think the ratio of males to females in college necessarily have anything to do with discrimmination 

but it's also been proven that men are better at math and science which goes along with engineering 

studies and such 

you've never heard that? 

yeah, and women excell in like language related fields like english and such 

i'm not saying it's true for everyone 
just for the majority 

no 

i agree women are less capable, and i don't think a lot of women would be able to handle the physical exertion 

then if they want to join the war they can 

but there are many many many more women who are not capable than are 

yeah i think that would be fair 

well i mean we can instate a numerous amojnt of laws saying that women have to be treated equally but that doesn't mean its going to change peoples mentality and as long as that's there discimmination will always be here 

no that's like saying racial discrimmination won't always be here

i mean our society used to treat and believe women to be inferior, that kind of mentality doesn't just miraculously disapear 

look at television, there are some shows that have part of their plot based on the fact that women are inferior 

sexist jokes 

oh i definitely believe in it 

but i don't think it's possible for it to completely go away 

and also you have to think about immigration, people that come here from like middle eastern countries and such that don't see women as equal come here and start families and instate that belief all over again 

yeah but if someone with that belief is working in an office under a woman you'll have gender discrimmination in the work place all over again
