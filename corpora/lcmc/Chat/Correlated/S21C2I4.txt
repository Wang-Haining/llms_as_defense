yup 

we gotta pull out 

i dont blame bush so much 

think hes human and hes doin all he can 

if we're gonna stay there thats what has to happen 

yeah 

i think we should pull out - this war is evolving into a world war - it is US against the world 

i feel like we cnt do anything to help if the country itself is fighting with ecah other

we're not 

we went into the war because of our emotions

it was an irrational desicion 

its us against the world in the fact that the rest of the world has so many problems

a great decision? 

y?

we had no plan 

i did 

but we had no plan 

ok

i was very pro war in the beginning 

was greatly effected by 9/11 

nah 

i dont kno about that 

i feel like taht just to cover up their mistake of making an irrational decision

yeah 

if we pull out - does anyon feel like a terrorist attck would ne more likely to occur?

yeah 

i guess so 

what about the draft? 

wow interesting point 

yeah probably 

hey i agree lol 

lol
i kno alot of guys that feel taht way 

i feel like the draft would hieghten the awareness of the war amongst people our age 

i feel like they dont care about it

right 

yeah

especially people in their late teens early 20s 

i agree but what wopuld get them to care 

mean - we kno that angelina and brad adopted again but we dont kno about roadside bombs 

true

really?

hah yeah 

i think because of the draft 

yup

that crazy 

right

yeah

i think there are still those people who dont but i think alot do 

i agree 

i kno people who have been over there and would go back in a day 

they really believe in the cause 

yeah

well i think lot of the people in iraq and other places feel like we are intruding on their culture and tradition by trying to put our gov in their country 

yeah

which is pretty much going on in iraq

i think its all about rights 

yeah

was anyone else effected by 9/11? 

?

does everyone agree that the war was an irrational decision based on emotions? 

i dont think so 


only because of the chaos that was there b4 we arrived 

hearing from soldiers who were there - i think us being there is impt 

we do in a sense but i think we help more 

true

yeah 

we can only do so much 

im not sure it would be a huge difference 

lol 

wow

no one listens to her anyway 

i hope 

id like to send her over there 

we would be screwed if she was prez 

not sure 

hence - hillary 

yup

should be interesting 
me niether 

lol o God, u kno that will be an issue 

lol

ick bad 

i feel like we should pull out gradually 

yeah

u gotta do what ya gotta do 

yeah

true
