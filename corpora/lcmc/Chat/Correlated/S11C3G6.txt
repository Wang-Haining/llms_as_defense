?so whats topic? 

This is one that really sticks in my craw 

Yes, I think its absolutly wrong to not allow people the right of marriage 

and i dont mean religiously 

wait, required 

civil union isnt required 

i think it should be ALLOWEd to everyone 

there is a non religious civil union now 

hello?

you dont have to get married religiously 

you'd be surprised at the amount that don't 

you can be married down at city hall, or by any judge 

no, not just in church 

its used in civil unions as well 

why

They should be able to say they're married if they want, they are 

I don't 
I was raised that way too 

so what 

Why should someone who sees it as marriage not be allowed to say they are married 

not by everyone 

Marriage is not a sacrament 

Its viewed as such in SOME churches, and some religions 

not in all 

no its not 

definition of marriage : the social institution under which a man and woman establish their decision to live as husband and wife by legal commitments 

no

thats the dictionary definition 

its ridiculous to tell someone they cant be married/ have a union just because of the sex of their partner 

its not an alternative 

civil union is marriage 

im just saying its still a marriage 

just not a religious marriage 

no im not saying they need a religious marriage, but they deserve the right of marriage under the law 

giving them the rights of a husband/wife 

such as pension, next of kin etc 

health benefits 

or wife/wife or still husband/wife because you could just say that husband is normally the breadwinner and wife is the one who stays home 

Legal has NOTHING to do with the church 

Yes

how do you mean 

church is still working under our laws 

?

unfortunatly the law is the law 

but i dont understand why the church comes into this at all 

it has nothing to do with the church 

if a gay couple wants to get married, and the law allows it (which it should)

well Church has a christian connotation and at this point in time Catholics at least condemn gay marriage 

church and state are seperate 

but they still have to follow laws 

thye should be 

technically yes 

Ive never seen lent be a big deal at restaurants 

Never

and public schools alternate between taking off jewish and christian holidays

I've never seen them 

I grew up in NYC so , for me i guess its diff 

which i think is crazy 

there is a MAJOR part of our country that is overly religious 

but who says that's right 

screw that 

19?

agreed 
pl

ok*

i agree with you

same with a lot of issues these days 

I honestly think that religious reasons aren't valid for banning gay marriage 

no it didnt 

haha

and the thing is, man isn't always right 

plus there were many gospels that were written that were thrown out by constantine 

but people are too stubborn for that 

i think so 

they want their way or the highway 

absolutly!

he's the guy who goes to funerals of men who died in iraq saying that their deaths are punishment from God because we suffer the homosexuals to live 

and they have signs 

God hates__ 

well you can guess the rest 

spelled right 

It was a play about Matthew Shepard 

his death 

his murder i should say 

i actually dont know about the democratic view 

well that i know 

Here's the thing, without relgion without government, do you think that gay marriage should be allowed 

well then what;s the problem 

Native americans shoop 

yeah thats what i figured
