there probably could be more offensive gay jokes... 

if theyre gonna redefine words, they should probably take that up with webster 

i dont care if people hate gays...but jesus, just let them be gay and then ignore them 

dont tell them what they cant do 

it might not be natural, but who gives a shit 

who is the govt do decide these things? 

i understand that the govt is made up of representatives from each state, but should our policy really be that if over half the country believes something it should be so? 

before we even get to seperation though, we have to get to "seperate but equal"

no, but im saying marriage is a fundamental right of humans, it should be an equal right for everyone 

this isnt a separation issue, its an equality issue 

white gay males are still white males... 

they are the same tho 

thats the problem 

thatss still discrimination 

so what if i said you couldnt get married 
would that be fair 

if you had to have a "civil union" how would you feel 

so like the separation of religions, so should gays be separated?

that makes no sense 

but marriage is different than a civil union 

what do we have to move on to? 

it would probably be easier just to stop treating gays a second class citizens, but hey, thats just my opinion 

heres a quesiton 

why is getting married in las vegas by a preacher dressed like elvis when your completely trashed to a woman you just met called a marriage, but two gay men who love each other and are committed to each other, have to have a second class degree of "civil union" 

gay people ruining the sacredness of marriage? forget that, straight people already ruined it stop complaining 

? 

im confused at what all of you are saying 

hell, not just republicans, everyone ruined it 

okay thats what you were saying 

i mean they ruin a lot of things, but

i mean anti-gay marriage is typically a right wing policy

while liberalism condones it 

liberals*

other way around 

lol thats true 

the republicans are the family values party, because they know just how to pervert the bible to meet their policy... 

and if he didnt exactly say it, he probably meant it 

dont worry, we cant talk about gays and not bash republicans, were on track

or already have 

all i have to say is 

i dont really like gays much 

well i was gonna say 

i dont like gays much 

but its not up to me what they do to each other 

i dont really wanna think about it 

but its not up to me 

yeah well i just wanted to say "i dont like gays" 

wanted to see what people said 

shits n giggles 

false

i am not a liberal 

i dont really like liberals either 

they screw up a lot too 

but they arent as bad as republicans 

that i do 

so gays 

i think they are still legally married, but they cant recieve any benefits from their state 

but the citizen shouldnt have to go to another state to get married

i think though that gay people would rather be legally married without benefits than nothing at all 

maybe?

sunbeauty are you planning on marrying a rich guy? 

i would like hear about this story... 

well it is 

if they would have had the ability to be legally entitled to marriage, then the partner would have first say 

well how old were the girls? 

see there we go 

apparently he has legal claim to her assets though... 

it seems like important details were left out, but thats okay... 

no words, just emotion... 

okay this story is making less and less sense lets move on 

ok heres aquestion 

why is it socially acceptable for girls to kiss and make out but if two gay guys do it its gross and disgusting 

i mean it is gross, but why 

but when two girls kiss they are both feminine and its awesome 

hey whats so off topic about two guys making out 

hey whats so off topic about two guys making out 
my last though is 

noo.. 

i just think that gay people should try out the other sex, see how they like it, give it a whirl, cuz they probably just dont know what theyre missing

plus i just read an article about gay giraffes 

and im done
