is that it or is there more? 

thats ok 

yaeh i was just about to ask that 

ok, well then 

i think i will respond by saying that.....i think the idea of marijania...humm sorry i am a horrid spealler, so forgive from here on out.....is a very contriversal drug no mater what angel it is looked at 

it is a bit wierd to be giving a drug that is illegal to someone who is sick in the first place 

yeah, but alcohol is not illegal, i feel that one of the main reasons that it is controversal is b/c it is illegal 

i am not saying it should stay illegal 

actually, in recent light of the past few weeks, i dont think it should 

actually, in recent light of the past few weeks, i dont think it should 

b/c so far it seems less dangerous than alcohol 

b/c as far as i know you cant over dose on it 

well, i just hadn't really ever givin the matter much thought b/c it has never affected me, but then i started to find out more about it through doing this study thing 

i actually feel that they should make it legal b/c then it could be regulated by the US govt 

and also we could actually make money off of it 

not all related crimes 

ueah

yeah

and cut down on the drug lords in south america 

so it would probably help a little bit 

yeah, seriously....like more people end up dying from geting the drugs accros borders and hold down thier "turf" in the cities and such 

aeh very true 

well, at least for selling that particular drug 

am sure they would find something else to sell probably 

oh, good thought 

yeah

correction....we would never do anything to help cuba,...but we prob would do something to help costa rica...they are considered the switzerland of the south....coure they dont relaly need much help 

well, we might actually do something to help colombia 

b/c they border our county 

and by helping them it would actually help us 

so in the end...it all comes down to us i guess, lol 

yeah i was going to say 

we have not been isolatoinists since we entered WW I 

haha ok we will save that argument for later 

yeah, b/c it it is all regulated by the govt, then it is all the same pretty much

ummm...i have to agree with sun_beauty 

with prolonged use, they do affect people 

just like alcohol affects the liver and cigeretts the brain 

well,...not enough people have proven it so that it is universally accepted

yeah, it is not compleatly different from alcohol and cigeretts

and i can personally say...that i have known people who have been on the drug for WAY too long, and they deff have changed....not as smart and they dont care about stuff as much as they used to 

 know 

like i still belive it should be legalized 

and regulated 

meaning that once it is legalize, if it is legalized...it will be a personal choice to people if they wish to do it or not 

what i ment was that some people dont smoke it now b/c it is illegal, but if made legal they would try it 

haha people i know 

but there is that 60% 

i dont know 

like i actually have a ton of friends that do it 

but i have just never had a desire to try 

yeah....needles and such 

then ur brain would be swis cheese 

haha

geez frankie27 get with the program, lol 

yaeh, please 

umm, well 

i guess it would be like drinking 
no drinking in public 

or being drunk 

i mean it would not be easy to regulate, but 

they usu. test people 

like with that whole...follow there my hand is moving 

and if ur eyes do that wierd thing

ur pretty much screwed 

yeah 

well apparently if ur high, ur eyes are bloodshot, and also you cant really focus on someone's hand moving back and forth from side to side

yeah

k

yeah...well the people i know were not scared 

they just didnt feel like doing it b/c it was illegal 

kinda like how i have some frieds who refuse to drink until they are 21 

mentally you can, but not phisically 

not always 
you can be addicted to smoking but want to stop 

b/c ur body is used to the drug in its system 

and has gotten used to functioning with it, and when it is taken away,...even if ur brain is telling you that you want to stop, your body starts to convuls and stuff cause it needs it and is going thru withdraw 

oh, haha 

sorry

you cant say that 

cause studies are still in progress 

i am not saying either way....i personally have not seen any of my freinds go thru any, but who knows if joe shmo had any...so 

haha, i am thinking that some people are defending themselves now 

no i was talking to frankie27, not u sun beauty 

lol

ll in good fun of course 

yeah why are u apologizing? 

Haha
