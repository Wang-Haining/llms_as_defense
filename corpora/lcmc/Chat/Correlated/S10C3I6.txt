i think a deadline needs to be established now 

agreed

the next president is going to have to make a really difficult decision 

which is sad because it is bush's mess 

in the begining i was uneasy about war in general 

i see war as a last resort 

me too but i am very liberal.. i think ties to the bush sr. were very much in play with us being in iraq noq 

unfinished bush family business 

and i guess it wasnt WMD's casue there were none 

me neither all i know is gas is like 3.00 a gallon and its not even the summer yet 

see at this point how long would a revised system take to implement time is important now 

yae but they can not stand with out us now 

the dependancy is too deep 

yea i agree bring the troops home 

soldiers that are over there are for the cause 

whatever the cause is they cant question what they are doing while they are in iraq they would becomie a liablility 

yea plus many of our reserves have been tapped 

and my reserves i mean people 

gradual what 

ahh yes agreed 

and at the same time making sure that iraqi forces are able to rule their own people 

there government and military must be prepared before we completely leave otherwise chaos will insue 

yea just like desert storm and our situation today 

soo

its tough ... democracies are just not realistic in some instances and i think Iraq is that type of situation 

yea agreed 

so did we reach the word quota 

umm atleast they got hussein 

yea deffinately its almost as though after hussein there was no game plan 

i completely agree 

yea just make it work however
