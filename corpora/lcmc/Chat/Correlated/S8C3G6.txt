both are wrong 

its not up to the state in the first place 

i agree with civil unions, but i think that should be require no matter what kind of couple you are, homosexual or heterosexual 

marriage is a sacrament 

it is performed in the church that you are a member of and should be a part of that 

once married in whichever church you should be allowed to apply for a civil union which will grant you the benefits 

it wouldnt change anything with the current state of marriage, you could still use husband or wife or whatever, but there would be a little more paperwork

no you dont, but still thats a whole different thing

 marriage is a term used in church 

thats a much more logical name 

for a non-religious wedding 

or so to speak 

i dont know, i tend to associate "married" with religion 

because ive always been taught it was a sacrement 

im not religious anymore, but being raised that way and all... 

the title marriage though is closely associated with the church 

im not saying they shouldnt be able to say they are, im saying the state shouldnt 

the state is not a church 

the state cannot perform sacraments 

its too close to a religious title 

thats like calling a representative a priest or something 

i feel that it is 

okay this is too off topic at the moment 

were discussing the title of marriage as opposed to gay marriage 

that is the more liberal definition of it yes 

i agree 

i never said they shouldnt be allowed to 

i just feel that decision is up to the church, for the religious unions 

to getting married in a church? 

yes it is an alternative 

if the church doesnt allow it there isnt much other choice 
okay, you win now get on topic instead of consistantly arguing your point which i will refuse to agree with 

well... husband/husband 

i do think that they should get all the same things that they would in a church, but as for the churches it is up to them to allow it or not
alright 

then we both agree 

but the way that our government has tried to enforce bans has been affecting the church 

and if they banned it altogether it would impact the churches right of free exersise 

if you ban gay marriage then you wouldnt be allowed to get married inside of a church either 

exactly, but i dont feel that its up to the government to make that one decision for them 

i can understand somnething that would be determental such as a church that practices killing people 

maybe for your case 

but in many cases people do get married in a church 

how about those "lent friendly menus"

ive never had off for jewish holidays 

hence the push for the amendment banning gay marriage because of his catholic beliefs 

win

high five 

in the front 

to the side 

big brother 

sweet, chinese food! 

thats weird 

youd expect Utah to like them, usually its the dems who are after cigs 

i think what it comes down to is there are too many uber religious people in power 

be are be 

alright

so yeah 

these uber religious officials are using their power to promote their religious beliefs and banish all those that dont agree 

alright

exactly

it would be logical if they came up with some reasons as to why, but they dont because they're all religious 

religious reasons

and that wouldnt pull through if they let that be known 

any suggestions anybody? 

nope, and thats where most of the opposition comes from 

with activists like fred phelps 

never really was, just didnt become a large issue until today 

a much larger and open gay community exists today 

san francisco does 

in this country it would probably be the bible 

id go with catholic 

though i cant assure 

it just seems to have a great impact 

especially with the tyrant we have in office now 
yes it did

it did, and i got the memo 

the bibes have been translated and retranslated its impossible to say which one carries the original meaning 

its meant as a way of life for you to decide, not for your country to 

according to it god gave free will to man and let him choose, so why try to enforce the opposite

but did we know the laws they would make? 

you cant trust a mans heart 

yes and we can change them 

but its up to them to reign with our trust 

and they have failed us 

and many dont 

but its nice to try and find a happy medium rather than say "WE'RE RIGHT YOU'RE WRONG" 

and the worst part is it almost seems that people are diverging from the good lessons taught by their relgions 

like that church that fred phelps runs 

they praised the killers of matthew sheppard 

just because he was gay 

they built a memorial for him 

 "matthew sheppard entered hell on _____" 

now that doesnt seem too bible friendly 

though there an extreme, its still an example of how some people are taking their views out of proportion 

saw a picture of him with 2 kids on either side 

and the kids pulled away their coats 

and one shirt said He's and the other said "gay" 

the laramie project 

sp? 

a play about homosexuals or something (i didnt see it, anybody have some information

okay

the problem though is when all church begin to deserting the original intents of the bible and going on religious crusades to stop one thing or another based on a couple words 

like our current president has tried with gay marriage 

anybody got some werds

im not sure about that one 

but we could see it happen with the democratic takeover

well the current republican view is more or less against it 

probably more 

so it probably wouldnt be changed with them in power 

so maybe well see with the change 

yeah

 guess we could talk about the amendment

 first amendment that would restrict the people rather than the government 

yes

i dont see why they shouldnt 

people are people 

people can love who they want and want to spend their life with whoever 

no matter what age, race, sex etc 

how about you donny? 

alright so we're all in agreement about that 

i dont have a problem with it 

in many cultures it is perfectly acceptable to be with someone of the same sex 

in roman culture it was looked up upon to have a lover of the same sex 

yes 

HELLYEAH

because if you fought alongside your lover youd perform better

or so they felt 

i forget what culture it is, but they believe that it means something spiritual if you are attracted to the opposite sex 

not opposite

i meant same 

yeah it was something along those lines 

hoorah
