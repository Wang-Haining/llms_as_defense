what kind of issue is using the information? 

so, it's okay to use the information to protect students

and alcohol doesn't endanger people's lives? 

under-aged drinking doesn't endanger people's lives? 

eating isn't illegal

under-age drinking is 

i am making that distinction, what about high school kids? 

and the laws from 30 years ago don't matter, the laws now matter 

it gives reason for suspicion 

don't schools have a responsibility to protect the students, whether it be from shootings, or the influence of drugs and alcohol? 

that is an invasion of privacy 

that what is a worth while cause? 

that what is a worthwhile cause? 

yes, and your point is? 

i'm not saying the school should listen in on ur phone calls 

right, so internet is different from phone 

the person who receives or sends the email can choose to share it with anyone 

emails are used in trials as evidence 

i have a question for everyone 

it's based a real life situation 

that happened at the elementary school where my mom works 

a groups of kids in the seventh grade formed a hate group on Myspace

directed at one girl in particular 

if you're the principal and you come across this information, what do you do? 

what would you do Janada? 

i don't think that anyhing had happened yet in school 

to the teachers' knowledge 

yes

so mtnbike, you would leave the situation entirely alone, you wouldn't even talk to the kids to try and help them resolve their differences? 

but this group was in existence for a while, and growing 

what about informing the parents? 

u don't see a problem with hate groups? 
it was a racial thing, though i don't know what race exactly... I apologize I don't rmember all of the details 

i do, but I wonder if they had not been found out, if something might have happened 

what the principal did do was call a meeting with all of the parents of the entire grade and gave a information session about myspace and warned about its dangers, and its lack of privacy 

how unsecure it is and how easily accessble it is 

oh no, talked about the group 

gave detention to the participants 

it was a very big deal 

i'm not either, but it's what they did 

I'm not sure I do either, but I do agree that some sort of action had to be taken 

If I may ask your opinion about another situation that happened at my high school

there were pictures online of several girls who went to my high school, pictures of a party where they were drinking 

one of the girls was looking at these pictures from a school computer 

and the school administration has access to all the sites accessed by students from school computers 
and they use this access to monitor the students' activity on those computers 

and so the principal saw these pictures 

no disciplinary action was taken by the school 

but the principal did notify the parents 

her right, lol 

wait, going back to what Rocket ship said, you think that all websites that allow people to post pictures should be blocked at school? 

are you condoning or condemning that fact, mtnbike? 

that the principal didn't directly do any disciplining directyl - he let the parents handle it 

right, and just notified the parents, I wasn't sure whether you supported this course of action or not 

what if people are downloading harmful material 

like, i don't know, porn 

yes, but you have to make sure students don't find a way aroun dit 

they tried to block AIM at my high school too, but somehow some students found a way around it 

it's not a question of why they do it, it's the fact that somehow they are able to do it 

well yes, the library is a place for research and study 

not chatting 

i see 

isn't it the school's responsibility to foster the best possible environment for learning? 

and doesn't blocking AIM, games, and things like Myspace trying to creat that environment 

so teachers and administrators shouldn't try to help the students get the most out of their education? 

right, and blocking AIM, etc. is cutting distractions 

besides, if education were ultimately up the student, why are there compulsory school attendence laws

but use aim where, on school computers? 

school computers that are meant for students to do work on?

really, is it free for you to do drugs? 

on school property? 

exactly, just like there are rules against using AIM 

I'm saying that "free" time is not time when you can do whatever you want 

because schools have rules 

but were you not just condoning that? 

i believe that it is blocking AIM, games, and sites like MySpace 

on school computers 

well, I think that schools have a responsibility to first and foremost provide a safe environment in which students can learn and grow 

and that they should act on any threats, suspicions, etc. that they find on public website like MySpace
