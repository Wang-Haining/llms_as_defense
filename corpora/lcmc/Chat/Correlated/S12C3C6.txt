I could agree with that, gays in particular 

But the question targets the catholic church 

I could agree that to be a respected institution they have to hold true to the core of their beliefts and values, but some practices and subtleties have to be brought up to date 

ME

exclude the ME 

Not arguing that 

but we are not talking about a lot of groups 

just the one that thinks God created all of us equally 

I think so 

because they discriminate from those going to heaven and those who do 

but who says their way is right? 

That is discrimination 

Exactly 

their very nature excludes people 

Exactly 

Right 

same thing as back in the gender discussion 

no power, who cares 

If I may, I would like to relay an idea presented by Nietzsche

He claims there is such thing as a slave morality that is very much a part of the Judeo-Christian beginnings where the people were originally enslaved and/or oppressed, and because of their position in oppression they create values that support the "good" man as being humble and of less power just because it oppossed those who have more power over them 

Basically he sums up that Christianity was created out of a need to have a superhero (God) who spoke for the humbler and weaker people 

Knowing how strong the human mind is, it certainly is a provoking thought 

I do not agree with some of the literal interpretations such as this no meat Fridays

Perhaps we can look to Emerson as another authority who says that we can process our spiritual lives on our own, why have a non-personal institution attempt to do that for us through empty practices 

That supports Nietzsche's claim Janada 

Your prior comment about comfort 

That religion was a way to comfort the people in the slave morality position

I stated my opinion that they can hold true to their core, but some of the practices are just empty and meaningless 

such as the meat business on Fridays 

Not necessarily, just does not seem pertinent to the practice of the religion 

the big 21st century question is homosexuality 

I think if we traced the tradition of meat-eating we would find it was not really created with the beginning of the church 

Sure

but it is not an accepted view of the church 

and that's the change the organization as a whole needs to make 

agreed to both of you 

perhaps

I can agree with that perhaps to some extent, but how can the priest fully enjoy God's gifts without a family 

I do not think the ban of marrying is necessary 

Precisely

but they look much weaker by sticking to their ways 

That does not seem to make any sense 
Another example of weakness 

certainly shows some inconsistency 

Hopefully it would be a sign of change to come 

They are not representing the Catholic Church 

Agreed 

It applied to other imperfect acts of priests 

corruption very early on in the church 

but I still think the whole organization is based on nothing, as mntbike would say, so it is very easy for them to make up an excuse when something like child molestation happens 

People in general shoudl question their beliefs and have some self-reliance 

the gender issue 

Well what I am saying is to believe what you wish but base it on reason and question what you believe, do not merely accept things, and if you do not believe in the Church, then it means nothing to you, but it can still be there for the people who do believe in it 

Yea mtnbike 

I certainly think so 

those strongly in support of religion may say faith 

but that faith must have some root in reason 

how do you establish that faith 

it did not materialize 

it only matters that there is some root 

It could seem ridiculous to have all of the faith in the world that pigs will fly

but it is not backed with reason 

there is some reason in Christianity in the sense that some of these historical figures existed 

but certainly not enough reason to call if truth 

therefore, if you wish to believe, faith is involved 

That should be a shot in the foot 

not necessarily, if they wish, I think they should question their reason though instead of merely accepting and going through empty practices as I believe many people do 

yes 

sure it's off topic, but it came up 

perhaps

I can agree with that 
It is rather unfortunate, however, we need such an organization to get us to do service 

Yes

Sure, they have some good stances, but again I think it somewhat sad that we need an organization to tell us those things, but perhaps some people need that
