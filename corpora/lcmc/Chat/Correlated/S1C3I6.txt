yeah i was confused as to why 

yeah

its just confusing in general 

like why are we still there? 

yeah i tihnk we need to help clean up 

yes i agree. i dont think we an just up and leave 

clean up was the wrong way to put that. 

yes i agree, but i dont tihnk they could be on their won 

own

yeah

yeah i agree there are other conflicts that we need to focus on too 

well its not even that they dotn know what they wanted to fight for, but even wew ere just discussing how we dont know what we are doing over there 

yeah 

same here 

all im saying is that i think we have lost focus and if many people in america are not sure what we are fighting for isnt it possible that some of the armed forces are not sure as well 

yes

definitly gradual 

?

getting out of iraq gradually

yes definitly 

agreed

agreed

i mean basically i just feel that we have lost alot of focus after that

yes but we like planned to make them a democracy. i feel like its an unrealistic gorl 

goal 

ok thanks!
