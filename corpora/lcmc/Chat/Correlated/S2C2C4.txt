the... gay.. church? 

Can we get a clarification on the story? 

Divorced means just divorced or couples who receive an anulment? (whatever the word is for the church allowing someone to marry again) 

Oh

Okay, well I agree that divorce is way too wide spread these days. Marriage is getting trivialized and basically means nothing. 

The reason is that they are supposed to devote their lives completely and utterly to God. 

(And not to someone of the opposite sex) 

The Da Vinci Code is hardly a reputable source, though. 

Hasn't the Church proven its falsity?

No no no, I'm not sure. 

I just figured since they made it into a Tom Hanks movie, it must not be too reputable. lol 

Couldn't the act of love also strengthen their ties to God? If you are a priest, you believe that God granted you that sacred act. 

Well, the only way to have an institution last for so long on a global scale is to keep it constant. 

what are you referring to, specifically? Vatican II? 

Right, but you have to be careful what you change. In Vatican II, they made changes to the mass ceremony that made it much more available to people attending. But changing celibacy and allowing female priests would change foundations that have been there for thousands of years.

Okay, that just seems silly

Do you know the reason for that? 

More devotion is required for a priest. 

What do deacons do anyway? 

That means they were never really married in the Church's eyes. 

Otherwise, the people eligible for priesthood would be really slim. 

So what about allowing priestesses?

What if there was no shortage? 

So what about not allowing divorced couples to receive communion? 

Marriage is the most sacred of bonds, though. 

I suppose it depends on how difficult the process of annulment is. Ideally, an annulment would take care of all those marriages in which it was not the fault of those getting married. In that case, I am fine with not allowing divorced people to receive communion. Marriage should be a LIFE decision. 

Yeah, that seems reasonable to me. Kind of a dissapointing conclusion, though.

Such as if one person did not want to have children and one did. 

Since the annulment process is out of control, legally divorced couples should be allowed to receive Communion anyways. 

(I believe that is our conclusion) 

Hey hey hey, maybe some kind of process to allow them back into the Church community? 

A Penance? 

Interesting point.

Hmm... well I do not agree with abortion. I think it is different then the gay marriage question., 

clockwatcher, you made a good point. To be a Catholic means to share the views of the Church, no? 

Otherwise, what does it mean

? 

Exactly

Well if you believe in the church then you believe that it is directly connected to Jesus Christ

Therefore, shouldn't you agree with everything they declare to be Church doctrine? 

Then, to me, it is pointless to be a Catholic. 

I don't think so. 

Yes, clock, but the Church has an official stance on everything. In the real world, it makes sense that most people would disagree with some aspect of the Church. But where do we draw the line between picking and choosing values? What makes you Catholic then? 

goldeneye, i don't know...that's a very tough call. but personally i would like to think that i still have a religion even though i don't blindly follow everything i'm told. 

It's not that you SHOULD follow blindly, its just a interesting question whether you are truly a Catholic if you don't

To me, being Catholic is being a good person and embracing the core values of the Church (i.e. Ten Commandments). I really don't think Good will shut out the gates of Heaven to a good person who got divorced. 

God*

Right, that makes sense

lol Crash 

The problem is that an infallible institution is run by fallible individuals. But hey, we can't have it any other way. 

The Catholic Church is an institution that should not have any errors. 

At all. 

I know, I'm saying thats the problem. 

It can NEVER be infallible

But it's supposed to be... 

Another one of these unsolvable problems. 

I still think you do. Heres my reasoning: 

In high school, I was taught that everyone is NOT entited to their own opinion on ANY subject. For instance, I would not make a claim about a gay gene to a geneticist or something
Therefore, aren't the Church (Vatican, Pope, Cardinals, etc.) the most qualified to form interpreted opinions about Church doctrine

Well, in being a Catholic, you are basing your life decisions on what God would want, right? 

You wouldn't. But the people who are in the best position to interpret God's will all live in the Vatican

Thats seems okay 

Both very good questions. lol 

To answer those questions

And with experts being wrong, it definitely occurs, but they are still the logical choice to trust.
