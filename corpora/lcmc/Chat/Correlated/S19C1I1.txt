so articulate 

what do you mean? 

i don't think the war started out pointless, like we did accomplish gettin rid of sadaam, but there isn't anything good coming out of it now and it's just being dragged out 

well the US has a thing for going after countries they see as a direct threat even if there isn't any real valid reasoning 

yeah but now that that ruler is gone, they don't want us there anymore 

i know do we invade every country that has people suffering bc of their gov't 

agreed 

well obviously the US didn't invade Iraq for either of those reasons 

what do you mean by power vaccuum? 

ohh gotcha 

well when the war started i'm sure most didn't see it as a mistake

i don't think it was so much of a lie as it was something the perceived to be true 

i think having a draft in general would just be ridiculous 

well it would just be prolonging a war that well above the majority of the country doesn't support anyways 

mmm not really 
i mean on one hand, if we're in a war that actually needs to be fought and there aren't enough troops it seems necessary but it also doesn't seem fair to ask someone to sacrifce their life for a cause they may not even believe in 

well i mean i think WW2 we had a direct reason to fight 

this, not so much 

well at least not anymore 

yeah exactly 

same here 

what do you mean by cohesive force? 

but can you really fight terrorism by invading only one country it's happening in? 

the idea of fighting terrorism kind of seems implausible to me because it happens in so many places 

and it's not like Iraq is the only country with a personal vendetta against Americans 

well unless they find Osama, i don't think finding or killing one member here or there is really that effective 

well he's kind of like the mastermind behind all the madness isn't he?

you can always find more teachers 

how do you know they won't be effective? they'll still get the job done won't they? and it's not like a member of a terrorist group needs to be intellectual, they just have to carry out their duties, a lot of which end indeath for them anyways 

yes, but you don't have to be effective in that way to make a good terrorist, you just have to know how to follor orders

well they're free, and they don't want our goverment so why stay there? 

well that's true, and maybe we are helping to protect them from that danger, but at the same time, it does seem like they don't want our help 

maybe not altogether, but sending more troops isn't solving anything either

agreed, there are too many consequences no matter what we do 

yeah but for every good thing we hear, how many bad things do we hear about?

probably that the US underestimated the gravity of the situation and now we are caught up in a war that's taking much longer than anyone thought it would

you say you don't support the war, but really it sounds like you do

how can you support the motives and not the war? 

you can say you dont support the way we've gone about the attack

so you're saying that there are ways to solve the problem without going to war? 

how?

but in doing this wouldn't the Iraqi people we are trying to save still suffer?

and i think that it is impossible to cut off whatever resources are aiding the terrorist because obviously those countries aren't on our side 

well in order for the UN to be effective, they all have to be in agreement, and obviously not everyone is in agreemnet over this war 

so are you saying the UN should have more of a say in the actions one country wants to take against another? 

wait you really think we should just hop along country to country setting up democracies? 

you know one of the major problems with a democracy is finding someone to run it, and it's a lot easier to put a corrupt leader in power then to find a just one 

rocket ship i think you're making the idea of democracy sound a lot easier than it actually is

it's more likely that democracy in Iraq will fail than succeed 

well it's not up to us 

it's up to them, if they want democracy then they'll work for it 

we can't hold their hand the whole time 

okay
