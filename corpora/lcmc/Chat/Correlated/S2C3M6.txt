I agree with that.

 Legalization of marijuana for recreational use, either for people over 18 or over 21. 

So what do you guys think, it shouldn't be legalized? 

Decriminalized 

Well, in Spain. 

The difference is that if it were legal there would be no penalties at all for doing it. To decriminalize it means it is not considered a criminal act. 

As in if you are caught smoking marijuana in Spain, it is just a fine.

No criminal charge is brought against you. 

I'm not sure. 

No, just decriminalized. 

I only know that for sure in Spain though. 

And I know in Amsterdam you can carry up to a certain amount legally.

I think it's a pretty small amount. 

Okay, we're just kind of sharing information here. lol I think marijuana should be fully legal. What do you guys think? 

Why?

So does alcohol. 

Bad enough? 

lol 

No, it's not. 

Except, of course, the effect on your lungs. 

That's why it does not make sense to keep marijuana illegal.

Alcohol and cigarettes both have their different negative effects, so what's the difference? 

Typically though, you would smoke a lot less marijuana than cigarettes in a given day. 

I know that. thats what I am saying. 

Yes, Crash, people do. Thats personal choice though. 

Yes 

Clock

Agree? Disagree? 

Oh, okay

No problem

So I say as long as alcohol and cigarettes are legal, marijuana should be legalized. 

No restriction on amount. 

Well, wait. 

No restriction on amount

I think it should have the same restrictions as alcohol in terms of things like, say, driving a car. 

Well, if its legal, why should there be a restriction on amount? 

Out of control? 

Well, what about alcohol?

It is up to the individual to control their use, isn't it? 

Well those countries have taken steps towards legalization. We are talking about if it is fully legal. 

And I didn't cite them as precedents, really. lol 

Right, rocks.

So why isn't there any restrictions? 

Gradual is always best. 

Thats an interesting question, I have no idea. 

I agree with that though, it will definitely lose a lot of teenagers with the thrill factor gone, like you said. 

My motivation for its legalization is that it should be personal choice to use a substance that is just as harmful, in many respects, as two other legal substances.

Hey crash, you said something before that was interesting but I missed it. It was something like "Will marijuana's legalization lead to debates on legalizing other drugs?"

What do you guys think? 

I think it definitely could. I don't know of any other drugs I would want to have legalized, however. Anything that causes physical dependence is a no-no. 

Wait, I need to modify that

Thats true, its a hard question. 

I think, for one, the word drug is very broad. I only know of a few drugs, like heroin and cocaine, and there are effects are just too major to ever be legalized.

Plus the physical dependence factor. 

So yeah, I agree with you guys on that one. 

Hmmm..... 

For one, I think since (if it is legal) it will be the one legal drug, a lot of people will only do that and not risk breaking the law. 

And also, marijuana is a gateway drug in the sense that people try it, find it to be not too scary, and think they can handle more. That is more of a problem of drug education. 

What do you guys mean by "addictive qualities"?

Oh 

Okay

No, ma'am

?!?!??!11?!1one1!??
