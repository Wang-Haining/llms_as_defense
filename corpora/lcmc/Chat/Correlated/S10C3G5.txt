i think a loving gay couple is way more fit to have an adopted child then a shitty marriage between a man and a women 

yea but by so many people you mean so many people from the east and west and not even majarities in those areas... the midwest and south are another story

yea i totally agree about that 

see i hate that the catholic church even comes in to play here 

how many gay men and women are catholic in this country 

unless its 100% then it shouldnt matter 

im saying a gay jew is confined by the lack of separation of church and state 

is that right? 

not sure i am pretty sure orthodox jews are like catholics

 which ones? 

ahh gotya 

i am all for adopting children also 

love is love 

yea

i guess its some what related 

what do you mean 

and throw it 

i agree if it is all nature and no nurture then it should be legal 

i would hope so... but who knows 

they might blaim the parents 

yea exactly and as long as it is looked as a negative in any way then it will not be allowed 

good point 

they just do, the church does a lot of things without to much reason these days 

i think we have discussed this in other chats 

yea i know 

which brings back the point that where does the catholic church come in to play in our countrys legislation 

agreed

yes

yep
