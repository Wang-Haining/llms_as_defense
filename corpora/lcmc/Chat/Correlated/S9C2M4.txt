Yup

well, i believe that there should definitelly be legalization of medicinal marijuana 

because there are demonstrated benefits in patients with certain chronic illnesses

I am hestitant about the immediate legalization of recreational marijuana because I don't believe there has been enough research into the long-term effects of the drug 

is there a certain age minimum for using it in Denver? 

ah 

are there any restrictions against smoking pot and driving? 

in that case, if it's just as or less harmful than legal substances like cigarettes and alcohol, and the same restrictions are placed on it in terms of legal age of consumption and driving and so forth, I don't see why it shouldn't be made legal 

would anyone be allowed to grow it? 

do you think that there would be problems with under-age marijuana use, as there are severe problems in this country with under-age drinking? 

what do you mean by completely? 

legal for all ages you mean? 

what about Amsterdam

for all ages? 

i wonder if drug trafficking would really subside if marijuan were legalized

i feel like there are plenty of other drugs

 that marijuana wouldn't make that much of a difference 

is marijuana a gateway drug? 

it's true, i was reading an article in the NY Times last week about certain sleeping pills 

that were found to cause people do drive while asleep 

which must be at least as bad as driving drunk

not really, if you think about studies that have shown that driving while exhausted causes similar effects as driving while drunk 

but a drug causes that effect 

but this is all really beside the point I was trying to make, which is that there are legal drugs that remain legal even after extremely harmful effects are discovered 

sleeping pills? Yes

exactly, people should be made aware of marijuana's effects before they use them as well 

and more research should look into those effects 

because if we're comparing marijuana to cigarettes and alcohol like we have been, i don't the amount of research is comparable

then why did we take an alcohol edu course, but not a marijuana edu course 

neither is alcohol for kids under 21 

what do mean that the school does not have to legally cover themselves? 

right, but only the students under 21 have to take the course 

um, college is known for marijuana use 

i think you're missing my point, that is, if marijuana were to become legal, I think that schools need to take the same measures they do with alcohol

provide as much education as possible about it 

I had to sit through the alcohol edu tihng 

thing*

i'm sorry, what is a legal and relevent problem? 

Ah

can you elaborate on that? 

I'm sorry, I'm still a little confused 

oh I see 

this is true 

Does anyone know, in Denver, what the reaction was to the legalization of marijuana? 

Do you think that a legal age of consumption will become a controversial issue, as the legal of consumption for cigarettes and alcohol has been? 

what do you think the age should be? if that is, you think there should be such an age minimum at all 

If I may just bring up a fact that I think is rather important and relevant, there is no record of any deaths that have been attributed to marijuana use, but it's too hard to count the number of deaths attributed to alcohol use

i do however wonder if legalizing marijuana will really decrease use of illegal drugs 

if the reason for smoking pot is the thrill 

than people will most likely just start with another illegal drug 

perhaps one more dangerous 

but it may cause some harm, the Drug Policy Allliance states that studies on marijuana's mental effects demonstrate that the drug may reduce or impari short-term memory, loewr concetration, and alter sense of time, swift reactions and coordination

impair*

lower*

I'm not saying this to argue against legalization 

I'm saying this to argue with the statement that the drug doesn't cause any harm 

that is why i support the legalizaiton of marijuana 

because the effects are no worse than alcohol 

I just wanted to make it clear that there are certain harmful effets 

Effects

i'm sorry, i wasn't responding to you Janada, i was responding to mtnbike

yes... though I believe that along with legalization an increase in available information and education should occur 

i am more concerned with the details of implementation 

for example, what is a small amount? 

right, and will there still be crime with people who try to sell or obtain more than is allowed 

I these are all questions that the govenrment should consider
