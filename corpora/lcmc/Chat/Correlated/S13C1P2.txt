i agree with that...i have nothing to hide and don't really care if they scan my calls

so in essence we're really talking about the patriot act here?

i think that's in the provisions of the patriot act....that this information will only be used for the purposes of preventing terrorism 

but it seems here that everyone is for it 

interesting

that also brings up an interesting issue though: you can't necessarily PROVE just from a picture that you were drinking underage. for example (and yes i know that this is unlikely) but you could just be holding a cup and not actually drinking it.

yes that's true 

so if you set all of your settings on facebook so that only your friends can view your profile, how would the school be able to look at your pictures anyway? unless they access it from one of your friends 

but is that right? 

but for the NSA thing, we're trying to prevent terrorism, not underage drinking. i think the caliber of those crimes are completely different 

again i have a quesiton about how they are accessing your facebook profile if your settings are completely private 

yeah that's my question...i know that the internet is public, but if you speficially set up your account to be private, is that still public anyway?

*specifically 

so then if someone somehow hacks into your supposedly private profile, i DO think that that is an invasion of privacy

good point goldeneye 

so then i guess in response to the facebook thing, if you DON't set your facebook to private, and then there are pictures of you publically posted, you run the risk of possibly being incriminated. but if you DO set it to private, then those pictures can't be used against you?? because the info would have been obtained illegally?? 

*publicly 

Right

yeah like we agree that the facebook and the terrorism situations are on completely different levels, but if we take a situation somewhere in between, when do we cross over from it being not acceptable to being acceptable?

i agree with the fact that it is the events surrounding 9/11 that have made it acceptable 

and in regards to a single life....i think that a life is worth more than privacy

but that's my personal opinion 

just to make things more difficult, i'll bring up this point: while we as college students don't likely have much to hide on the level of terrorism and are thus out privacy rights are not really affected by the patriot act, what do you think of the fact that this sort of an act will target certain groups (like arabs)? 

but did they find the letter by actively searching the locker or was it just lying around? 

yeah we had locker inspections at my school too 

ok yeah thanks nicole....i was wondering what made it ok in that situation 

but on the other hand, since it IS school property, you should know not to store anything in there that would somehow get you in trouble if the lockers WERE searched 

and if you do decide to do it anyway, then you should be aware that you are taking that risk 

yes but those personal things likely won't be incriminating

ok that makes sense 

i don't know...that's a good question though
