k 

deff not 

i think we need a new prez 

like developments as in more of our people dying? 

well at least that was one good thing 

minor detail 

minor detail that they didnt get the guy they were originally after

it was just a joke 

haha, its all good 

like i said...new prez please? 

yeah 

we deff need to fix things 

b/c otherwise we would leave the country worse then when we went in 

see if we just pull out 

yeah

well we should...b/c somone is going to take them over once we leave them in shambls...and that someone is prob going to hate us and just get us further into war 
yeah...wich makes this war even wierder 


but in answering frankie27's question on where wepons will come from....there are black markets 

exactly

common mistake, i think we can forgive you sun beauty 

and get us more "faulty info"? 

what would the more money do? 

i agree 

i think our best bet it to fix what we stared and leave 

i feel like we are all just repeating what we said on tues 

no, i know thta 

i didnt say it would be easy 

and i dont know how to pull out corretly either...that is why i am not in the military or part of the govt 

haha, 

that was good 

hope that someone has a long rope and that ur hands are above ur head

thats how u would get out 

k 

oh, ps,...i just noticed that the time for this is off 

it is 8:19, not 7:19 

oh, yeah, i remeber you saying that last time 

the little gray date next to our comments?

b/c now i have compleate faith in our govt 

(that is sarcastic) 

Haha

thanks livingdeadbeat87 

money 

there should 

it is kinda like the water gate scandle 

like he is, but not in the same way 

again, kinda like water gate...only bush does not have two reporters getting inside tips from "deepthroat" 

more than 2 what? 

again, that idea when russia did that to afganistan did not work out so well for them 

yeah

exactly 

and who is to say that there are not other people with tons of money waiting to fund peopel who wish to attack us 

who says thery are not 

they are just supressed right now 

or dont have to opportunity 

haha thats ok 

ummm so yeah 

livingdeadbeat or frankie....anything else to say? 

i know you guys have to have something 

yeah

exactly

i agree with livingdeadbeat 

wich is what we need to find out 

and we obv aren't going to find out our options 

until a new prez 

is in 

yeah...haha wow livingdeadbeat...you and i are seening exactly eye to eye for once 

lol

haha 

yeah

but again 

this was all under bush 

amen to that 

so that is why we should see what the new admins bring to the table

yes i konw 

and i personally know people who are being sent to places like that

but we cant really do anything abou tit 

sorry

it* 
haha 

wow.....ok so maybe i should mistype more often 

yeah 

hummm....i am trying ot think of other stuff that was brought up on tues 


but i got nothing 

he is getting there, patients 

lol 

but that they cant blame us for honoring thier wishes for us to leave

right?

frankkie...as much as i would like to do that, it just does not seem like the best option for the U.S.

see, i dont know, that is why i want to wait and see what our other options are b/f a desision is made 

i dont like that we are still there, and i dont like that we are sending people over there...eps when it is people that i know 

but i would just want to see what else is brought to the table b/f a jummpy desision is made 

who knows...maybe pulling out will turn out to be the best option
yeah.....and make sure that they are cabable of having enough man power to do it 

but i like the idea 

aren't we trying to do that too though

ike now 

perhaps you should be a canidate to run for office 

and that was not a joke 

yeah

i actually would not mind moving 

that already tho 

haha
