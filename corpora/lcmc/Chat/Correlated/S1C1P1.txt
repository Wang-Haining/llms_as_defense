As far as privacy rights go I don't think there is anything wrong with the NSA program.. if you have nothing to hide, whats the problem? 

well if we know this program is happening cant we assume that all conversations can be recorded 

i dont think they need the conversations that most people make, but if this program catches even one terrorist isnt it worth ti

it

they wont 

but for every 99 phone calls from college students to their mothers there could be one that means something

i mean we would be naive to think that anything we put out into technology cant be tracked 

i mean i dont think loyola should go looking for it 

but what if they find pictures of 15 other kids in the process 

should they be held accountable 

yeah but they cant pretend they dont see the other people in the pictures 

haha 

and the problem with facebook is that there isnt much censorship.. so theoretically loyola can punish us if they see it 

which at least half of loyola students are 

but as for privacy, we dont have as much as we think 

every text message you send can be tracked, every im can be recovered. sure most conversations arent worth it, but what about the text messages in the recent case with the 30 something year old teacher who was sending inapropriate texts and pictures to a like 15 year old boy... anything can be found

like you think you have privacy, you dont 

exactly. but so like these calls to catch terrorists. i dont mind, my conversations arent about terrorism acts. if they can catch someone through it then go for it 

if you have nothing to hide, whats the matter?

yes, but like we said, i dont think the NSA cares what we talk about in everyday conversation 

ok good point 


so would we be against the NSA thing 

i ddont know what just happend 

sorry 

 think we surpassed it 

but wait, do we agree with NSA? 

whats the feelings 

true, but we can have an opinion 

i agree 

yes

myspace isnt safe anything you put online can be tracked 

yes to help other innocent people 

exactly

and if the people who are tagged are caught then thats good 

i meant like if terrorists or child molestors are caught then good 

your social life doesnt have anything to do with your 9-5 weekday job 

but look at everyone's facebook pictures.. they are of when you go out... very rarely are their pictures of you studying at your desk 

so my point was not that social life has nothing to do with your job, even though i said that, what i meant was facebook can be decieving 

lets assume that like anything you ever post can be found... then it wouldnt matter if they said now take off the pictures of you drinking..

like how much do these companies really care
