thats wild' 

is there a question that follows? 

unfortunately, equality will never really exist i don't feel 

it will (hopefully) only get better 

well our culture is probably 

yea

what hoops said 

beat me too it, lol 

i dont think women are discriminated on a day to day basis 

i.e., women aren't viewed as having 'smaller brains' or anything that ridiculous 

evidence: "men are pigs" 

except the restrooms 

well

would legislation be going too far?

created/appending laws 

i mean, there already are discrimination laws 

besides enforcing them 
i dont think it is 

relative to the past century 

the state of affairs will always approach equality, but never be equal to it 

like limits in calculus 

who knows 

there will always be the memory of discrimination, so it will never fully disappear

hm

actually, i dont know if this is too off-topic, but the only swear word that actually offends people is the 4 letter "c" word 

maybe that says something about gender equivalence? 

who knows 

yes

well 

not so much discrimination 

but the objectification of women 

so i guess a branch of discrimination 

this is true 
all i'm saying is that the guys that are here can be jerks 

not all of us, but many 

lol im a guy 

a straight guy 

for the record 

just type a few random sentences before you leave, lol 

thats actually a very interesting fact
