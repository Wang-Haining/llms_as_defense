But who would grow it? 

I feel like its a situational kind of thing 

If the info is used to prevent a school shooting, then there's no way you can ignore it 

stupid people endanger themselves 

30 years ago the drinking age was 18 

Its more of a parental thing 

probably not 

school shootings are an infinitely more serious issue

What do you guys think about the government listening in on phone conversations? 

agreed - the internet is not a private place to begin with 

so its not really an invasion of one's privacy 

email is private 

I would leave it be 

Kids have always had fights and what-not with one another 

Was there anything that happened in school

yeah, I mean theryre only 7th graders 
so they arent mature yet 

right

not unless they got in a fight at school 

but if there was no confrontation at school, what's the problem? 

what do you mean by hate group? 

is it a racial thing, or just "so and so is such a nerd?" 

I feel it would be unlikely for the students to hate someone so strongly and not act on it in school

you know what I mean? 

If anything at all happened at school, I would treat it just like any other incident 

suspend the students, notify parents 

but not come out and say anything about the group? 

ok 

If there's no direct threat, people have a right to free speech 

Again, its not up to the school to administer the law 

that seems fair 

the principle didnt directly do any disciplining directly - he let the parents handle it 

what fact? 

seems like a misallocation of resources 

like what? 

how is that harmful? 

i dont think its that big of a deal anyway 

if students want to waste their time on aim at school, that's their loss 

What do you all think of the Patriot Act? 

up to the students to get the most out of their education 

schools should provide, not restrict 

I think its ok to use aim if you have a free period, but its not ok to use it in class

yeah 

sure 

a "free" period is free for you to do whatever 

if you want 

you just better not get caught 

those really arent comparable 

why not? 

because that is against the law 

I'm saying if you want to risk being caught, then go for it 

I didn't condone it 

If you put something up on the internet, its your responsibility to know that it isn't private information 

agreed
