is the DEA raiding clinics that arent legal

me too

ok lets see 

yea especially if its helping people who have cancer ryte>? 

that is tru u dont hear about pplo overdsing on weed its more or so the big drugs like coke 

what do u mean by non-enforcement 

like have a law and even if someone breaks it dont do anything about it? 

whats Id50? 

oh okl 

ohh good point 

then we wouldnt have as much problems and could focus on pressing stuff such as the war in iraq 

do you think it would stop drug related crimes then? 

or as many drug related crimes?> 

tru


and more workers 

yea tru 

it doesnt matter if there illegal or not

i feel that both of them are okay

like we said before they dont harm people except for the fact of the brain with prolonged use 

sorry im learning about drugs and their affect on the brain inpsych

i dont kno if i agree with that 

that is tru but i9t doesnt mean that its not there

and like we said weed doesnt really play as big of a role as coke or X so many studies havent been done on it yet 

nicole how long do we have to go until the next topic? 

ok 

ok

yea i was getting ready to say that 

even though its not legalized its still a personal choice 

yea i agree 

just like they do now when they do drug tests

what people? 

and the other 60% are people that are older generation or children or people that have friends and see the effects on them and just dont do it
