in some cases it is 

i dont think so either 

but we rarely consider gender bias against men 

yes

and with the "stay at home mom" ideal 

well it would be the same thing if i was a female construction worker

i think there are jobs that women can be more capable of and ones that men can 

but that doesnt mean women cant be construction workers, its more that most wouldnt want t 

to*

yeah, i mean women are offended than men are seen as stronger 

but it really doesnt mean anything negative to women, just that men happen to get more fit for things like construction 

i dont either, i mean i wouldnt ever be offended if someone told me i waasnt cut out for construction 

yeah

well, what do you think about women being drafted? 

some people think that since women are so caught up with being equal to men that if there were to be a draft women should be too 

but i dont agree with that 

i mean, it should be up to them 

but i definitely dont think all women are cut out to go to war 

yeah it depends on like 

health

and other issues 

but, i agree with frogger 

but at the same time, whether its a sterotype or not, a lot of women have a family that they would need to take care of if their husbands were sent off to war

yeah idk 

i think they should draft everyone, but it should be a womans choice

if they have to draft 

maybe, but i think a lot of women would go if they were called to rather than taking it upon themselves to enlist 

well there are a lot of factors, women arent capable of the same things men are a lot of times, like the emotional factors of war 

yeah

ahah

theyre psychologically stronger in more emotional aspects, but that doesnt mean they would be ok with shooting someone 

thats why traditionally women are nurses and men are soldiers 

haha, thanks 

yeah, and stereotypically men are more aggressive than women, theyre just more cut out for it

which doesnt mean some women arent 

yeah true 

i dont know, i mean it is instinct to save yourself but im not sure women have the same instinct as men in that way 

i dont think we can say they do or they dont but i think if they did there would be a lot more women soldiers now 

ahaha thats a stereotype 

but thats kind of the problem 

women dont want that view of them 

yeah its true 

but getting back to the main point, i dont know that they can be treated equally 

i mean women complain that they want to be equal to men, but every female in here and most you would ask would agree that they wouldnt want to be drafted 

you cant have it both ways 

yeah

ahaha, exactly 

yeah i mean women have come a llong way 

professionally

there are just as many women CEOs as men these days 

well the fact that there are any in fortune 500 is saying something, but even small companies 

i just think there is less of a "glass ceiling" now 

yeah

yeah def 

women can be just as smart as men, which is the equality they were looking for for a long time 

i dont know what that means 

yeah because even if they did get drafted a lot less women than men would be qualified i would imagine 

like with the push-up thing you just said 

i just think women will never be physically equal to men so whether theyre drafted or not doesnt nescessarily mean that theyre equal 

yeah definitely 

but it doesnt matter how much ambition you have, a lot of women just cant do 50 pushups 

ahaha

i just think there are a lot of instances when women cant do the same things men can, and also a lot of them where men cant do what women can 

yeah 

i think it should be their choice, no one is stopping women from being in the army, but that doesnt mean it should be drafted. its the same for men, no one is stopping men from being stay at home dads, but that doesnt mean all of them are cut out for it 

then weve come a long way 

yeah, i think equality should be based on ability 

men and women are different, theres no way to change that

no, def not 

if a man and a woman are both cut out for a job, thats where equality should come in 

yeah me either 

well women are stereotyped in sitcoms but so are men 

yeah

and full house 

hes a stay at home dad 

well, hes a full time dad 

yeah and there are plenty of sitcoms that protray men as sloppy beer drinking sport fans 

but that doesnt play a role in their applying for work

so it shouldnt for women either 

yeah that makes sense 

even shows like sex and the city, where women are independently successful

yeah so i dont think sitcoms really affect anything 

yeah 

i think they change with society 

which is important 

yeah, def 

ahah 

i was just going to say that 

imus

don imus or soemthing 

yeah and thats not really the same kind of show as like full house or home improvement 

yeah

yeah 

ahah 

yeah that alone shows weve come a long way

for people to be outraged about something he said about a womens college basketball team 

and for him to be fired fori t 

it just shows people are standing up for themselves 

and thats important if we want change 

not letting things like that be overlooked 

exactly

haha

i guess so 

lol

equality is awesome
