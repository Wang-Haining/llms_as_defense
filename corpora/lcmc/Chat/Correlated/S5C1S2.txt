what do you want it to be

my dad has made me lunches 

ive never encountered a woman police officer 

did you get pulled over? 

o what is the consensus? do we think there is gender discrimination 

i dont feel threatened by it 

you also see men 

paraded like objects 

i dont see that? 

wait where have they taken a half nude shot? 

Oh

Hello

i was paid more then the boys at my work bc my boss liked me 

i think its good women dont work there 

the pizza guys by me are creeps 

HAHA 

i dont want to see men in tight little shorts
the women choose to work there 

thats not nice 

they are just trying to make money 

i dont think its just there 

i think those attitudes can be everywhere 

do you personally know anyone that works at a hooters? 

: what do they say about working there? 

i didnt think the women were very attractive at the one in inner harbor 

yes and i do that around campus also? 

you sent that private message to me nicole 

haha its ok 

alright so you 2 are guys right? 

yeah sure 

nor have i been involved enough to notice 

i feel like its high school 

i dont think most people have matured 

opposite

i think guys can be however they want 

bc there are so few of them 

and girls try to conform to what they think the guy will like 

no they dont! 

they dress up for guys 

wait what? 

 dont think girls dress up so other girls dont talk about them 

i think they dress up to enhance their self image 

they feel better about themselves 

yeah that sucks 

people do what they have to do for money 

i dont get it 

 no 

ooooh 

i agree 

i dont really know what to say bc i dont hold a full time job 

it will take action to change things not awareness 

i dont know 

dr. sabin..do you get paid less then other male professors here? 

or do you see that on the loyola campus? 

everywhere i go there is an equal spread of doctors and nurses

no

i think i like that image 

i dont want to work 

i want to stay at home wiht my kids 

your husband does

me tooooo 

i think its personal choice 

i disagree 

i feel like society tells women to go out and have a job 

not to stay at home 

thats all we have to be concerned with 

llong as its happening now 

ahh i seee 

oh boyyy
