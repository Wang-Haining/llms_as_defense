well that seems more like reverse discrimination 

because they wanted to benefit from looking like female-owned business

yes, that's true 

yes i would say so 

it's usually referred to as reverse discrimination because it helps people who are usually discriminated against, but in doing so, it does discrimintate

really?

yeah i agree with that 

i think the reason it's not as big as it used to be is because people are making a conscious effort against it

like people are more aware of it now 

probably not 

but it is still possible to go further than we have come so far 

but i do think it exists in the workplace 

well certain fiels are still dominated by males 

sciences particularly 

things like engineering 

and then some jobs are considered too flowery for males 

like nursing 

exactly

broadly speaking, possibly 

but people generalize to think that given a woman, she can't do a man's job, even though she may be an instance of a person who is more capable than most men 

even if the broad generalizations are true, people shouldn't assume anything about a particular person based on their gender 

yeah but that's still not accounting for the few women who might be just as good or better 

if you generalize like that, you'll miss even the few good ones 

what do you mean? 

yeah, that could and probably does happen 

yeah, i think the hardest thing is to differentiate between someone being selected for a job because of their abilities versus their gender 

it can easily be misconstrued 

well what if gender is a factor? 

i would still consider that discrimination 

right, or only hiring minorities 

which is discrimination in its own way 

well in the same way that it may be harder for women to get certain jobs, it's hard for them to advance in those jobs 

it is definitely true for the same jobs, which is where it's the biggest problem

the problem with people getting raises is that there's no clear qulaifications for getting to the next pay stage 

well it's definitely true, sad as that may be

well the higher the salary, the bigger the difference would probably be 

more room for disparity 

that does probably have a lot to do with it, but since it is a general trend, the context thing might not be that important because you would expect those difference to even out 

if you were only comparing two hospitals, then the context would be a big deal, but i don't think it's that important if you see a wage gap in the big picture 

why would you think the opposite?

yes, because if people's salaries differed by even one percent, that would be so minor for a minimum wage salary, but it would be significant for someone making six digits 

well i think even in the same company, things like that happen 
yes, and its easy to tell the difference by comparing salaries 

it's very concrete evidence 

well like before we said it will probably never be completely fixed 

do you think something like affirmative action will work or just make the problem worse? 

well specific things about race 

like i know african-americans can run faster 

i don't know how much is known about job abilities 

that's definitely gender discrimination 

no offense, but it doesn't take superior mental skills to make a pizza 

there's nothing particular about males that would make them better pizza-makers

yeah, it probably would be eaiser for them to get away with, but its still just as bad

yeah, well i think noting it would be a good idea on the part of the government 

so people don't try to get away with as much 

well a business could face something like that 

or even lose their business if they refuse to change 

yeah, i hadn't thought of it that way, but it is important to keep govt out of business if possible 

yeah, i can't believe people would even attempt that 

sure
