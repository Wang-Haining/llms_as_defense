so you want the govt "using" your phone calls?

right now were being monitored 

lol i wasnt making a point 

i was just noting 

the irony 

but how can one be given a search warrant to monitor phone lines? 

and doesnt a search warrant imply that the suspect has some idea that they are being monitored? 

how would it help then 

sorry distractions in my room 

ok wait here we go 

well its not supposed to be public necessarily

you should be allowed to limit what friends view your account 

i mean myspace is a whole different issue

but only facebook if you set your privacy settings then those shouldnt by violated 

well is AIM the internet?
sure there is 

you dont think the govt has listened in on AIM convos? 

but they can track your IP address, and know who purchased the computer 

but you let this person on your computer then 

and it happened to be at the same time that this persons terrorist friend was on AIM to discuss bombmaking plans on another borrowed computer?

thats not the point 

that doesnt matter 

and that is still a privacy issue 

so should we allow it? 

good point 

the question is: does this violate ourprivacy rights 

i will once again quote one of my favorite quotes that several of you have nod oubt heard before 

They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety

because they made a compromise 

thats exactly why they dont deserve it 

its not that they wouldnt get either, but they wouldnt deserve neither 

because our liberties are innate to all americans, they are fundamental aspects of who we are, if we give that up who are we 

lol not freedom, privacy 

hmm unless you suggest that by losing privacy we no longer have the freedom to do what we once could on the internet, then you are right 

maybe if you talk a lot now you can leave early 

i think everyone has had it up to here with chatting 

up to there huh, your a patient man 

lol i think nicole left for a while 


she would not allow this 

lol i dont think im actually going to get $200 anyway b/c im pretty sure one of my blog members is not alive so 

alright im gonna try to revive this conversation 

good frankie 

well i go to special steps to make sure no drunk pictures of me go up 

what aobut the fact that other people can put pictures of you drunk up? 

but thats about all you can do 

even if yo uuntag yourself, you can still be recognized by authority 
haha
