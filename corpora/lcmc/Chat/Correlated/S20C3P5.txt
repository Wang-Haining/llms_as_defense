Yeah

Seriously

but on the other hand 

exactly, but everything that goes up on stuff like facebook is like partying (for the most part) 

that doesn't give a good representation of the people 

true

yeah, but for me....i'm not going to put up pics of me studying, which is what i do 24/7 

lol

i mean 

ME AND WESTERN CIV....NEW FACEBOOK PICS! AWWWWRIGHT!

Hahah

very true 

i don' think that' they're violating anyone's rights, but on the other hand, it's not a good method for them to go about if they want to get good information

so basically, i agree 

lol
it really is creepy 

but look at america in general 

america is OBSESSED with looking at other peoples' personal lives

very true 

we do, but on the other hand, i don't hink that they should be anal about it 

very true 

i think i've only heard like one or two stories of people getting screwed by it 

this definitely goes back to the cliche of judging a book by its cover 

i think that employers should only base their opinions off of things like resumes and interviews 

i thought you can remove the pictures 

wow, i'm slowly hating facebook 

thanks a lot cmc 

haha

true that 

damn... 

lol 

i don't think that many people take that seriously 

i mean, i've said things to people, and they're like COME DOWN TO NORTH CAROLINA AND SAY THAT TO MY FACE.....i'm in maryland...so no??? 

that's for like a personal case 

yeah, stuff like that is never serious 

well i'll be the bad guy 

i mean 

i agree 

but i'll act like i don't 

ahhhh the separation of this glorious group!

I DON'T THINK THAT OFFICIALS SHOULD BE WASTING THEIR TIME CHECKING FACEBOOK 

there, what do you think about that? 

i think that its a recreational thing 

for gods sake 

work with me here people! 

lol 

what happened? 

oh ahaha, i thought you meant something recently on the news

good lord...sorry 

he was looking for attention 

yes you did 

lol 

a kid posted a threat of a shooting for a school, and he got caught by officials on it 

yeah, that was definitely NOT an invasion of privacy 

wait, so dah 

you're saying that it was an invasion because he may not have intended it to be public? 

(just curious) 

well "post" is basically always been used with public display

i mean a poster...used to show people things....a post on a wall like a flier is used to get people's attention 

well i think that's probably how it went down 

me neither 

yeah, so aren't all posts public? 

that's rediculous 

does anyone remember how old the kid was?

high school age, right? 

yeah, but if his friends showed somebody, then how is that an invasion

for instance 

i've talked with people on IM before, and they've said stuff that's threatened themselves, and i contacted people 

well i now think facebook is also since this mark guy owns my pics now apparently

yeah, i agree with that 

i'm not sure if this relates to the topic 

(i don't even know if they're allowed to have one after they're convicted, etc.)

that would not be an invasion though, because they were already convicted though, right- you guys agree? 

true, but some people in this world......stupid 

lol 

yeah 
yeah, and times have changed 

like, when we were in elementary school, we could threaten to kill somebody, and it wouldn't be taken seriously 

i could yell as a kid, aahhhh i'm gonna kill you, but then columbine hit

or however you spell that 

so like people like us sometimes slip with that, not saying i do, but some do

that should also be taken into consideration...for a certain age group 

like kids now never say that... 

going back to what i said earlier...on IM 

when i talked to a kid, and he made threats actually against himself....and i got older people at the time 

do you guys think that's an invasion of privacy that i did that 

since that was a private conversation between him and myself? 

not really 

well i don't remember 

it's been years 

yeah, that's right 

that was before that age though 

true dat...does anybody else have any personal experiences that they can relate to this topic with? 

yeah, it's not common, lol 

well that's good, but it sucks for the convo 

lol 

13 more minutes 

LETS GO TEAM! FEEL THE BURN!

or not 

hahah 

but you need to know the line between privacy and well....."internet privacy"....which doesn't exactly exist 

in reality, i don' think that school officials should go on it unless they get a hint towards a threat, etc

they do that?! 

there would've been a riot at my high school if that happened 

i think that's definitely an invasion 

yeah... 

i mean 

well they can check the lockers and everything inside them, because that's their space 

(not myspace...ba dum...symbol crashhhhhhhh)

that was so bad 

i've heard stories of kids who have gotten suspended for bringing in batteries and some wire because they could make a bomb out of this....the kid was in elementary school.... 

exactly 

well that's a private school

lso you can't do a lot about that 

but for instance if it was a public school 

i don't hink that they should necessarily be penalized within the school system for stolen goods, i t hink that the cops should do their job and deal with it

yeah, and with a lot of private schools, there aren't locks on the lockers

well that's everywhere i thought 

as said before....some people just don't get it and are stupid

and especially in well, elementary school, middle, and beginnings of high school....the kids aren't mature enough to realize how dumb it really is 

some need strict rules, but the majority don't....it just comes down to the system trying to get to a small group of students that aren't any bood 

good* 

so in reality, what does it matter? 

so if the majority has no problems with the school system, then what's the big deal?
