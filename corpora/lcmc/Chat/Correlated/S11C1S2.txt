i think to an extent it is 

i see it in gender roles..its expected that women stay home,. take care of the children, get them to school, etc

and they can have a job 

but the distribution of responsibilities is so unfair 

true there has been progress for women but its not there yet 

i think while in theory things are equal, in practice they are not 

women have stereotypical responsibilities as do men and i think that still needs to change 

definitely

true women can work now 

but on top of their job, who has to make lunches for the kids? who has to make sure they have carpools to extra activities? 

but most of the time and stereotypically it is expected to be the woman 

on tv especially we are portraying this idea 

that is true 

and thats something that should continue to make progress 

teachers
not cops 

women cops are brutal 

really? they are mean! 

i got into an accident 

yes

there has been progress but it can continue 

i agree 

women are objects to look at for so many men 

and thats degrading 

i also think there is incredible pressure for women to look a certain way

but then what will they do? 

exactly and society dictates women revealing themselves as the way to do it 

really? why? 

dont even get me started 

my brother goes to hooters with all his friends and they think its a big joke to joke with the women there and be rude 

they do 

and most of them just need the money 

but should they have to put up with men who go there, thinking its ok to be like that to them? 

but you dont know why thats where they work..maybe its the only place that would hire them 

maybe its close to their house 

a lot of the girls who work at hooters in the cities are waiting to be actresses 

yes

she says you wouldnt believe how crazy it gets in there 

men want to take her picture, they grab her ass, and they whistle at her 

but she works there because it is the only place near her school that would hire her when she really needed some extra money 

men don't go there for the food..lets face it..they go there to look at the women, drink beer, and say things they cant say around the women actually in their lives 

shes not even a waitress! she s a hostess 

well then from my experience you guys are the exception 

haha my brother even flew on hooters airlines once with his buddies to check out the women 

see..you make a mental note of them and their appearance though' 

and judge them based on how they look! 

haha 

nicole, im really sorry but i have to go in about 5 minutes to my family event to help out with something 

at loyola, its mostly female in the student body 

i dont think gender discimination is prevalent 

what do you mean? 

you really feel like its high school? 

i dont 

i actually think its harder for guys to be their own person and do what they want to do at loyola than it is for girls 

but what if a guy doesnt drink? its alot harder for him to feel like he fits in than if a girl doesnt want to 

they dress up for other girls 

girls dress up so other girls dont talk about how disgusting they look 

that too...but how is their self image enhanced? if they get positive feedback from others 

that is weird...and seems like a lot of work to not allow women to make decisions

thats degrading in itself..its like saying we know women cant do it on their own so we'll lax up things for them 

thats what happened in this story 

i agree about crooked business 

haha 

your welcome..bye guys!
