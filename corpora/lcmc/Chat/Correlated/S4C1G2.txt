people act like being gay is such a horrible thing 

i think it should be on par with straight marriage 

what makes gay marriage so different from straight marriage? 

why shouldnt they both be allowed? 

what does the Bible say? 

but homosexuality is not something you choose 

so gay people are condemned to hell just for being gay?

who cares about the church 

ok 

i agree 

who is the one who condemns us? 

because of prejudices 

what do you think of the people who say homosexuality is a choice? 

yeah, should we restrict people for having red hair? 

of course not, because its genetic 

i think that hit the nail on teh head 

yeah thats a strange correlation 

and they cant do it - because its something youre born with 

what do you mean? 

to a certain extent 

like the language we speak 

but why would someone choose to be gay and face all the hardships they have to face? 

does anybody have any gay relatives? 

i have a gay uncle 

i dont really understand 

i thinks its ok 

kina

kinda* 

right, because they have to go through so much to get married


yeah, thats just the church talking 

sure its possible 

just not as likely 

glad to hear it 

i dontbthink any of us can really know until we're married 

i think it would be a step backward 

thats the religious element in this country

yes

just not frequently 

could you explain? 

What are other countries' positions on gay marriage? 

i feel like europe is probably much more open 

definitely

a country like japan would frown on gay marriage 

true

absolutely

i think we've exhausted the issue 

i think there are a lot more gay people than we think 

what is it like 1 in 8? 

and i dont think that prejudice will ever completely disappear 

gays should be given teh same rights as straight people 

people are different - there's no way around
