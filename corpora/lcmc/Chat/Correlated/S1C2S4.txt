Yeah

i feel like there will bea lot of animosity 

agreed 

those people will always exist, there are men out there who think that a woman in a high job in a business is absurd too 

haha 

also "mr. mom" or the man staying home to take care of the family 

and some people still think that it is ridiculous 

not dual lives, its a lifestyle in which the woman doesnt have to stay at home all day and can still be the mother 

yeah

yeah there should be no differences between pay of men and women in the same job 

yes

yeah

definitly agreed 

yeah i dont think it could fully disappear, there is always someone who will have a counter view 

yes

but so can some of the girls haha 

haha

oh thats awesome 

ok
