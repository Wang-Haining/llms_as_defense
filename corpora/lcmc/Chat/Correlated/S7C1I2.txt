what the heck for? 

thats stupid...has anyone seen a major improvement in iraq since we have been there? 

i mean they got saddam hussein* and not even osama 

lol

and they havent even set up a new govt 

yea tru but werent they after osama 

wait spacestare what was ur comment about?

Ummm

yea i heard that prez. bush was lying about that 

just a reason for us to agree to go to war 

oh sorry!!...lol 

YES!!! 

i kno 

he doesnt even the support of the ppl any more 

and the small % that he does have is slowly steadily decreasing
wat?

is that another joke? 

i dont think we can fix things 

but how 

if anything we should pull in increments

and maybe set up something temporary

if we pull out they are gonna really hate us for leaving them in chaos
