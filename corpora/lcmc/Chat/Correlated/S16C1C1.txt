has anyone seen that movie dogma?

yes 

its basically a big satire on modern catholocism 

for instance, george carlin is a bishop haha 

was anyone in here raised catholic 

would you ever consider becoming a homosexual or eating meat on fridays during lent? 

do you go to church regularly 

personal question you dont have to answer but just think about: do you abide by the no premarital sex rule 

because all four things which i identified are restrictions of sorts 

but god cant directly order you to do the rosary for repentance 

like a priest can 

we go to a school which is a "catholic" environment, and i see more people crapping on their faith than following

to follow shoops point about dedicating 

today the catholic church does a lot of good things social service wise

they set up aid programs and what not, and are big proponents of social justice 
but also, for 150+ years people justified slavery on BIBLICAL terms 

e.g. divine providence and black people being the descendants of cain 

maybe they are unfortunate outlets for the frustration which necessarily follows from celibacy 

they feel sexual frustration as well 

if a married man can feel enough sexual frustration to touch kids, then an unmarried/celibate man sure as heck will too 

in a way true 

hmmm

like where the world came from 

and what the point of all this is

and religion provides those answers 

HAHA

hey wait though 

we should understand that

not all priests are bad 

and CHRISTIANS should similarly understand that

not all muslims are bad 

just because a small section does something doesnt mean its representative of a larger behavioral trend 

you are an intolerant scmuck 

wait just kidding 

the man is listening 

heheheheh

well lots of other religions do it 

blue: good call 

i disagree 

women in the priesthood would be an inclusive move not a bribing mood 

it woulkdnt be like 

"lets make women priests to BRIBE more females to come in the door”

its more like "maybe women will feel less traditionally excluded if we let women be priests”

but some people also take it way too far 

absolutely not that would be a travesty in the eyes of god and they would all go to HELL 
it is every bit as set it its ways as youd expect a room full of old italian men to be

true true 

well thats where nuns come in 

it is 

ideally they all are 

i dont understand how in gods eyes a newborn is born full of sin 

at least within their orders 

i was there and it was a delicious pretzel of god 

so yes 

nuns should run mass 

i think we should all be friends 

but about nuns though 

why shouldnt they be able to run mass 

methodist churches arent often struck down by wrathful lightning bolts

welll... i was there in spirit 

k

thats a chauvinistic thing to day 

say

so blue why wouldnt you go to church for a woman 

oooh okay 

in th201 i read that the pope said the church should dynamically stay with the times in order to remain a current influence 

it seems holdin on to antiquated views about gender doesnt help that 

i think women should be invited to the priest party too

toward the priests which they should be allowed to marry 

haha jk 

thats your browser homepage isn’t it

i hear priests today talking about how they are worried because the numbers of new priests are dropping 

i wonder why! 

thats up to the catholics 

i mean if we are going to believe that GOD says priests have to be celibate, and GOD said homosexuals/abortion is bad, we will need something more than some stories scribbled on a lamskin 2000 years ago to go by 

if we want to take it literally that is 

judaism has lasted longer though 

or maybe jewish people dont feel the need to be IN YOUR FACE about their religion

because its doctrines don't necessitate faith-based world domination

just about ALL the social service programs which catholocism sets up have a dual purpose of conversion 

but they do good stuff tho so im not hatin
