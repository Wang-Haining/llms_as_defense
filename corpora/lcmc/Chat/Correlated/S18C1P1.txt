do you know what the difference between "unacceptable" and "strongly objected" is? 

like, which is worse 

k 

big brother is always watching 

exactly

well, i agree with xyz, but i really don't see why the government would even care about 99% of the phone calls made 

i don't think the NSA will mark down in their files that billy broke up with sally or whatever 

some agency is probably recording this right now 

thats stupid 

loyola isn't the NSA 

thats the best point 

its stupid, becuase loyola shouldn't care, but knowing that they can use it against us should be enough warning to avoid putting something incriminating up 

ehh.... thats taking it a little too far 

i mean, last night some kid got rocked in the dome with a beer bottle at a bar 

hopefully theyll use facebook to catch the kid 

no

loyola should only care about the offender 

well don't be tagged 

"it wasn't me" 

"i have a twin

More

hahahaha 

yes 

heh

like i said 

big brother is always watching 

but they don't care about a lot 

the NSA doesn't care about some idiot who puts a picture of himself getting stoned on the interent 

exactly

if that was the case 
yea

eh 

thats not quite a solid argument 

i bet theres some stuff you want to keep "private" that you have online 

a message to an ex-boyfriend/girlfriend 

something, you know? not neccessarily anything illegal 

everyone has something to hide 

thats not what you said though 

said "if you have nothing to hide, whats the matter?" 

good point bjbsh 

lol

best example of privacy invasion 

lol

am im getting close to 300 words? lol 

roflmao

nothing we say will change the nsa 
sure, why not 

"go nsa" lol 

hey let's get tagged.... bombs nuclear war white house 

haha

guess not 

if a tree falls in the forest... 

lol 

yea

its a show on MSNBC 

a girl pretends to be an underage girl in chat rooms 

and the cops record her messages 

they lure sexual predators to meet in real life 

then chris hanson does his badass "you're on a tv show" and questions them then they arrest him 

its hilarious 

i love watching the pervs get sent to jail 

exactly

they actually just use AIM 

chat rooms

oh maybe they use that too 

who knows 

if youre smart about going online, youre not going to get tagged

well people are tagged for random reasons 

that is an excellent point 

but its not like your employer is expecting you to be sally do-gooder 

if its one or two pictures, they shouldnt care 

well, not unless its you snorting coke off a dead prostitute giving a thumbs up 

lmao

pretty much 

but they could hire private detectives 

another good point
