we are talking about gay marriage now right

and you alone are right =P 

so they can cosign mortgages, visit each other in the hospital, and uncontestably write each other into wills, civil union would be a fair thing to look at 

if they made a non-religious civil union and opened it up to heterosexual couples, id bet a SHITLOAD of people would do it 

because they wouldnt have to go through pre-marriage catholic counseling and shtuff 

there is? dont most people still get married in a religious ceremony tho?

word 

church and state are separate? 

never 

religion and country require the same types of allegience, and religious/moral convictions ALWAYS express themselves politically in any liberal state, especially democracy 

do you go to the post office on christmas and say WHY THE HELL ARE YOU CLOSED? 

its always closed 

same with easter 

but not yom kippur 

lent is a big deal at restauraunts and what not but what about ramadan, which is basically another form of the same thing 

its not 

christianity helped glue a lot of this country together for a long ass time 

what about extra veggie options on fridays 

i ALWAYS see those during lent

that differs from municipality to municipality 

okay you think church and state are separate? 

one of the crucial pillars of our PRESIDENT'S election was his mobilization of the RELIGIOUS right 

they chose him, and he owes his moral allegience to them, hence his wacky "marriage amendment" 

up top

down low 

slam

they are allowed to be so 

e.g. UTAH 
you can't buy cigarettes till you are 19 

yeah they made a special law cuz they hate cigs so much 

same with abortion 

e.g. the quran vs. the bible vs. the torah 

or even the king james bible vs. the other one 

whose interpretation of it 

the bible is all so cryptically worded that you can interpret it a millino ways

HAHAHA sick quote 

oh yeah of course 

man was simply the efficient cause right 

god was the primary cause 

blah blah blah 

that dude is a puss 

he was supposed to come here last year and didnt show 

its about the matthew shepard incident 

the dude who was gonna protest it is the same asshole who goes to iraq soldier funerals with a bullhorn and yells slanderous stuff 

we are truly scraping the bottom of the gene pool here 

ancient greece for instance 

HIGH FIVE 

no the us military doesnt typically operate like that i think
