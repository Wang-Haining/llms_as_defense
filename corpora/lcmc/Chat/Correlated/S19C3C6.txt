well when you say that you can't just target the catholic church

true, but a lot of people and groups aren't accepting of gays 

they don't not associate wiht non-catholics though do they?

what do you mean based on nothing? 

well that's true of every religion, but you can't say they base it on nothing, hey base it on the way they interpret the Bible 

it seems to me like he has a problem with all organized religion 

some people find comfort in religion, i don't see whats so wrong with that

yeah but the Bible also says to fellowship with other Christians, church is a way of doing that 

well the Bible is God-breathed 

i mean i'm not catholic and i don't understand some of their traditions either but at the same time, they are traditions and part of what the church was built on, you can't just take them away just like that 

but the change would have to come in europe, not inthe united states 

well i think it would solve some problems like the lack of priests and the pedophilia but at the same time priests are supposed to be married to the church

well you can't be married to your spouse and married to the church at the same time 

families are very time consuming 

one or the other will end up getting neglected in some way 

im not saying they call it fact, it's just one of their traditions 

i know somewhere in the Bible it says that it's better not to be married but if you can't control yourself sexually then you should or something like that 

that is interesting 

yeah, that really changes things 

really? why is that? 

i guess they're getting desperate 

how many have there been? 

well maybe, but at the same time there are men who are married that molest little boys 

im not saying they are, i was saying in response to its prevention

im also not saying there isn't a correlation, but correlation doesn't imply causation 

well im sure they said that statement long before molestation was an issue 

so if the catholic church is so corrupt and built on nothing do you think if it were a possibility, it should just be dissemble altogether 

? 

the lay people? 

ohh okay 

it's kind of hard to generalize a group so inconsistent

yeah definitely can agree with that 

well theres other organizations that do service, just none so prominent 

well we go to a catholic school, im sure a lot of people who participate in community service wouldn't if the school didin't support it so much
