Yes

make it go away... 

lol! tru dat! 

yeah, same 

but "stay the course" isn't a great motto 

SOMEthing has to change 

Definitely

and definite plans for any aid we give to iraq afterwards 

hmm

thats only a good idea if iraqis would support that and keep it that way once we left 

i dont think so either- i just think we're not being supported 

right

but it's not liekt he rest of the world is fighting us 

it really was 

?? 

well for a great decision it wasn't well planned 
yes.... 

i would 

i never thought it was a good idea to go into iraq 

i don't know about that 

does that go with the "we went in just for the oil" theory?

cuz i don't know the facts on either

oooo wow 

what was their rationale then? do u know? 

not really 

we still have our hyped up security

it would happen either way, if it was going to 

i have a question - do you think women would be included in a new draft, since our roles have changed so much? 

that would be scary

haha

hey hey, none taken 

i'd be in canada anyhow 

lol 

i would be scared as shit 

i admire, but don't understand 

i think the draft would definitely make people care

but should we have to threaten them with serving overseas in war to get some emotions up? 

right, frogger, thats why i would be scared!

not knowing whether i'd be gone for 2 years or 10, and whether bush would decide to declare war on someone else in the meantime, would freak me out

me too 

i just don't know, dah, i don't think we can ever recreate the 70s

certainly would have been interesting 

so why do you think the war in vietnam had such a different response from home, if iraq is compared to vietnam every day? 

Yeah

which makes it worse that they were treated that way 

at least we honor our soldiers in iraq

wow, true 

i think just because we don't support the war doesn't mean we shouldn't support the soldiers 

wow

thats just leaving cold turkey though? 

cuz i mean, we have to leave sometime, and iraq will probably never be what we started out to make it 

ok 

right - we got to choose our own system of government

hopw they're ruled over is something citizens tend to feel strongly about 

how*

i feel we are too 

ooooo i agree

i agree* lol sry i was confused 

yeah, they dont have the right foundation for democracy at all 

well thats because we didn't have to right foundation for a monarchy overseas to rule us 

except for the civil war... 
but growing pains happen 

i think it's different too 

we're britain, iraq is the US 

i think so too in the end 

they have a right to choose their own govenment 

no, i didn't know anyone 

i think even if we pull out right now iraq will be in serious turmoil for years to come 

i think we have a big hand in their turmoil too 

i really don't know 

well i dont think we should stay, but thats why i think we should pull out gradually 

yeah 

maybe if we lessen our influence there some force from withink will pick up the slack 

hmm... didn't someone use a jenga analogy last time? 

for something else, but i think it applies here 

lol... silly hillary 

lol
she's my states senator and i still think she's a joke 

thats awful 

way to set a good example for the country, hillary 

me too lol 

they went to war for our country, the least you can do is look them in the eyes 

idk, is she the one who supports leaving all at once? 

ah, the flip-flopper 

is bush still working on a plan, or does he actually have some ideas about how we're going to leave? 

hmm i just thought he might have mentioned something in 2004 during elections 

oh well 

well then i guess it does depend who we get in office yet 

next*

no idea, i haven't been paying attention 

bad me :(

barack obama? 

i don't know anything about him, but i've heard his name a lot 

hahaha! 

Lol

BAD... eww! 

haha nice topic... 

wonder if they have to deal with hair in the sinks in iraq... 

lol 

same - with dates attached 

years at least 

lol 

right! at least having a schedule will give us goals to work for 

sweet

very true
