well i think that the discussion starter brings up one of the problems of legalizing marijuana for medicinal use only....its extremely difficult to inforce this

with what, goldeneye? 

yeah i didn't realize that 

what's the difference? 

ok that's interesting...i didn't know that 

so can you purchase it legally? 

so it's really NOT completely legal 

yeah the netherlands are usually the most commonly cited example

i know you are allowed to smoke in public places there though 

i honestly don't know what i think. my initial gut feeling was that i was against it, but i was the only one in my dicussion group of that opinion and i totally got shot down 

i couldn't defend my reasoning 

haha

yeah exactly....i was just going to say that in terms of the lung effects....cigarettesare certainly known to be very harmful, yet they are perfectly legal 

but why should we endorse harmful things 
i mean if someone wants to do something, they're going to, but we might as well not make it easier 

so goldeneye, are you trying tosay that it would be less harmful for your lungs bc you don't smoke as often 

?
k' 

i don't know...i'm not an expert on the effects, i just wanted to make sure i undertsood what you were saying 

haha sorry 

so.... 

what sort of restrictions do you think there should be? 

i think it would need to be 21, because the effects are more similar to alcohol

no restriction?? 

i disagree with that 

didn't you cite other countries as precedent and say that there ARE some restrictions on amt? 

well goldeneye, do you think that this should be a gradual legalization process or just jump right into full legalization? 

yeah that's what i think 

haha ok 

i think that initially there will be an increase 

right

fair enough 

well i think that other drugs are much more harmful, so you can't even try to put them into the same category as alcohol or cigarettes 

and since that seems to be the reasoning for why to legalize marijuana, i don't think that you can extend this to other drugs 

go ahead 

well i'll say that while im at least OPEN to the possiblitiy of marijuana, i am 100% against the legalization of anything else 

yes.....i think that once the thrill of marijuana is gone, people will still want to get that thrill somewhere else, so they will move onto something else 

(people who might have been content with marijuana while it wasn't legal, will no longer be satisfied with that) 

rocks, i agree with what you're saying about its addictive qualities, but i'm talking about WHY people do it....more people might try other drugs instead because marijuana no longer will provide the thrill that it used to 

i agree, goldeneye 

i'm done
