Ready

tough one 

im not that educated on marijiuana - however i think small amount would be okay - i guess it owuld be just like alcohol 

the people who i have talked to about it who do smoke - they always say that its not that bad for you and it hasnt been proven to be bad for you - ive been told all my life that it is - whats up with that?

ve never heard that (about cigarettes) 

lol

im confused on the whole subject 

alot of my friends smoke 

lol

i agree with that

isnt it already really expensive? 

y?

wow okay lol 

same

i think if they did legalize it theyd take full advantage of it 
i agree 

hahaha 

i wouldnt 

me niether 

but i know alot of people who would buy it 

really? 

thats interesting 

whats a small amount? 

Right

niether am i 

my friends say they have gotten really paranoid 

thats scary to me at least 

right thats wut i have heard 

i think if they legalize it it would be made more safe, if its more pure ya know? 

o ok 

good question 

yeah i know lol...i guess 
right

how weird would that ne 

be*

ive never even heard of that 

is it just a drug or does is it used as medicine? 

Hahaha

good point 

thats so strange 

yeah thats seems off 

ive heard that some people do better on tests when they are somehwat high 

i think so 

same with my friend (SATs) 

right - im not really clear on the health issue 

i agree 

too much of anything is bad for you 

and tobacco is still legal 

tobacco?

theres like noway to regulate how much tho 

u mean like, you can only buy one pack at a time? 

noway 

so i guess with pot, either legalize it with no limits or keep it illegal?

i agree on that 

right

me too 

its driving while under an influence 

dont think that matters 

the amount will matter but not the substance 

right

yeah

if it is legalized do you think there will be more accidents due to high driving? 

it doesnt say in the Bible not to smoke 

but i do bet is says somethin about keeping your body pure and take care of your body 
so im not sure 

yeah id agree 

im not saying anything is immoral 

im not sure what it says in the Bible so i cant answer 

right 

its your choice 

same

i think if pot was legalized the effects have to be made clearer to the public

like the effects of cigs are 

but if it might be made legal thats an important thing to know 

the gov would want to know i think 

yup 

?
i dont understand what you meant by they cant get anything? 

yes, so cant they test it? 

o ok i just got confused sorry!

me too 
yeah

yeah

not if it was sold over the counter 

i guess so 

im sure people will still grow pot 

especially if it is going to be more expensive to buy 

yeah i guess you're right 

i think it owuld because i kno thats a huge issue with my friends 

where and who they get it from is always a big deal 

well what about the people still getting it from people that grow it ? 

true

y not? 

they do? 

thats so funny i had no idea 

i really need to read up on this topic 

yeah

would legalizing it effect that "area of business"

yeah i dont think it owuld be effected 

yeah, maybe it will eventually cut off the blackmarket

agreed 

agreed 

and then you would still have the underage people trying to buy it 

hahaha 

o good 

i agree 

yeah

i thought it was "all or nothing" 

thats what i think 

just like alcohol 

o ok 

agreed

neato 

thanksss melisssaa 

byebye :)
