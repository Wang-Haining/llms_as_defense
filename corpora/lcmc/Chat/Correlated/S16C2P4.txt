Privacy

Privacy

i draw my shades when i change clothes 

o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o

internet = public domain 

and by the way, that question should be up to mark zuckerberg, he owns EVERYTHING you post up there

last year in the SGA i championed the facebook privacy issue 

and after putting a SHIT TON of effort into it, we figured out some kind of consensus 

we had public forums for students and drafted a student opinion statement, and what we ended up reaching with the school administration was this:

errrrr no 

errrr maybe 

they don't have a policy on it, BUT, when it comes to judicial hearings:

hey will not bring the FB evidence up in your hearing, because that would be opening a whole new can of worms 

BUT, there is no way that they can ensure that EVERY pjb member who is judging you wont look 
AND, there is no way for them to guarantee that no admins will ever look at it before a trial, even tho they cant bring it up 

cuz last year, two kids in my grade got kicked out and FB evidence was brought up in their trial 

so my grade had a shitfit and i made sure the administration knew that... so even tho its kind of dont ask dont tell, the rule of thumb is WATCH WHAT YOU PUT UP ON THERE 

york road shenanigans 

a fight basically 

on york road when the bars got out 

and there was a FB picture that placed the kids at murphys and it was timestamped 20 mins before the fight 

scott eckhardt (student life admin) brought the pic up and shoved it in the one kids face at the trial 

but the VP presiding over the trial was like WOOOOAH PUT THAT SHIT AWAY

most kids dont have privacy like that 

but almost all admins/profs do 

you would be appalled to know how many staff/faculty here are on the FB regularly

shoop: that was a part of our ratified statement of student opinion

blue, yes they do 

almost ALL the VP's, and bunch of the profs. have FB 

lots of office staffers too 

technically, they are allowed to do whatever the hell they want, this is a private institution 

i have heard a loyola VP say out loud that "when you arrive at loyola, you check your constitutional rights at the door" 

the internet is technically public domain 

so shoop we have the right to set the privacy like that 

but many choose not to because they post the pics in the first place so people will see them drinking etc etc 

because you are a loyola college student and in attending this school you agreed to comply with rules/regulations/standards 

as expressed in the handbook 

and if you are 19 years old and there is a pic of you double fisting two bottles of budweiser.... 

oooh yeah one more thing from last year:

they will NOT instigate an investigation based solely upon your FB, i.e., they will not look for handbook violations to prosecute you for based just on facebook, but once the damage has been done, the PJB people at your trial may or may not have looked at FB 

brb

back

since loyola is a private institution and is not the US government, loyola does not have to answer to the same legal/constitutional constraints that the us govt. does 

exactly

and they draw the line at not filtering through your Facebook

BUT they reserve the right to do it if it has to do with hate crimes, vandalism, or violence 

exactly, they reserve the right to look at FB for hate crimes, vandalism, and violence 

hahaha the pillowman 

i have a feeling locolady has hinkel for understanding lit 

the author admits to the murders in act 3 and then retracts his admissions at the end when he kills his brother 

i have a hard time believing that many college students read mcdonagh for hun hahahah but props to you 

no

he wrote about the stories and his disturbed/mentally retarded brother read the stories and then enacted them 

but wait how does this all tie into privacy 

well if this happened in our american system (and not the fictional one in the play) 

the cops would have to bring the book to a judge as part of an argument for a warrant/summons for the author 

and it would be up to the judge 

and if the parallels are so close/eerie that it couldn't possibly be total coincidence, then the judge would likely say that it is suspicious enough to warrant a summons

but if that was in the public domain it would be admissable as evidence 

the prosecution would barely even have to worry about getting the evidence thrown out on the grounds of privacy 

anything public is public and works as evidence 

dont deal 

*done deal 

even if not TOTALLY private 

oh come on 

okay 

i dont prowl through your underwear drawer 

there are no cameras in your bathroom 

what this is all boiling down to is the philosophical struggle between privacy and security 

er conceptual struggle 

your own devices 

? 

so you would rather there are no police but you have your own bullet proof vest and gun to enact justice for yourself 

LoCoLady: id rather be left to my own devices security wise and give me my privacy

? 

Oh

or more commonly 

if theres not enough security people are often willing or forced to give up privacy

:) :) :) :) :) 

(big brother is watching) 
thomas hobbes would fit in better with my "enact your own justice"comment 

yes big brother hehehehehehehehe 

explain 

well for instance 

how private do you feel when you are chatting online 

such as this hypothetically 

sure

everyone

so you feel like anyone at all should be entitled to listen?

well what about other forums 

like when we are in our discussion groups 

well what about other forums 

like when we are in our discussion groups 

are those private or public 

if you met with 3 other people to talk about, for instance, marijuana or gay marriage 

is it a public study 
did you sign a privacy agreement 

so

do you feel like that form gives you an expectation of privacy here

i read through the whole thing 

it was quaint and incomplete, but it basically pointed about identity disclosure

then do you feel like this is private or public and should people be able to listen

i like asking these questions as they contain much hidden irony hehehehehe 

well 

she is listening yes 

its public 

so do you feel like ANYONE, including people youve never met, should be able to comb over your words here and judge your character? ;) 

or would that be an invasion of privacy 

so locolady if i knew your name 

blue

and loco 

and shoop 
if i knew your identities 

would you be cool with me going through this if i were a person youd never met 

and then judging you 

no you didnt 

you signed a form being PROMISED that nobody would know your name/words and how they correlate 

but given the fact that you signed that form 

if i were a stranger who lived or worked in some random building like, i dunno, somewhere on the baltimore beltway or the balt/wash parkway

true true 

campus! privacy 

okay

so the internet is the public domain 

but this is a "private" chat room somehow 

im confusing myself haha 

but is it really maintained here 

this isnt a private room because people will be reading this transcript so they can "study how people communicate" right
LoColady, i couldn't agree more 

and in a way i am almost anticipatory of that being the case

just because i feel like thats a smart way to be haha 

hahaha 

well when it comes to privacy 

what do you guys think about all the WIRETAPPING (hot button issue! hot button issue!) that went on 

i don't think we will ever know the whole picture (or what their motivations for doing it were) until 20-30 years when all the docs are declassified 

i think its all one big scandal to KEEP SHOOPDAWHOOP DOWN!!!!!

jk shoop 

the government NEEDS to know whats going on and what the peoples opinions are and congressional elections arent a totally adequate mechanism for doing so

so wiretapping/human asset sourcing could be good ways of linking the minds at the "top" with intel/ideas/opinions/data from the "bottom" 

AS LONG AS it isn't used for repressive reasons

which it hasnt 

and will not be 

well they can tap whoever the hell they want honestly 

we live in an executive age when executive orders transcend most judicial scrutiny, the agency and the NSA lie under the executive branch dont they! 

wel taps havent led to many arrests, have they? or have they and we just dont know about it 

either way tapping like that is dangerous ground to dread 

*tread 

but remember they dont lie under judicial scrutiny 

for the most part 

*ahem* 

AHHH SHIT YOU GOT ME 

my name is valerie plaim 

this is my new job 

plame

errr 

hot button political attitudes in a nonchalant study anonymous atmosphere

uh oh shoopy left 
no valerie plame was that cia op whose name got leaked in the whole scooter libby karl rove thing 

are we done im hunnngry 

haha 

YES I DID 

WATCH YO SELF 

lets all meet at primos 

and find out each others identities 

then the semi-privacy in this room will turn into camaraderie! 

YES I AM 

Wait

Nooo

i want to talk more for like 2.7 more hours 

: ;) just kidding im a silly goose 

Okay

Keep recording
