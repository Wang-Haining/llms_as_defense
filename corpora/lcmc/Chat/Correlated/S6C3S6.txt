Yeah

(okay, maybe not eons) 

(but you get the idea) 

yeah, there are a lot of professions that are seen as being exclusively female, but a lot more that are considered male 

yep 

they're physiological differences, to a certain extent, too 

yeah

best to keep in mind that that's an "on average"-type statement, though 

well, i don't think we should have a draft, period 

they tend to lower standards during times they're pressed for soldiers, though 

they just recently lowered the minimum acceptable test scores to get into the military, for instance 

well, there's no reason a husband can't stay home for the same reason, though

i don't know that's a fair basis though...not enough women have been through war for their to be reliable psychological data on it 

: well, i think the separation descends from the men being hunter/gatherers more than anything else. it has to do w/ women's stereotypical role as a nurturing gender. that doesn't mean that they're psychologically less capable of killing people, it just means that's the role associated with them 

not necessarily. i think that the ability to kill is something you can lose, per se; it's probably more instinctual 

can't

hey have to in order to survive, theoretically 

so if you placed a woman in the same situation, there's nothing to say she wouldn't do the exact same thing 

i'm not saying they do, but i don't think we're able to say that they don't, either 

i think that the fact that their haven't been many women soldiers before is at least as large a mitigating factor 

right

right, but does the idea of "equality" have to be profession-specific? 

what you're talking about is a complete 50/50 split of the work force. that's a very literal form of equality 

not in the fortune 500, there aren't, i don't think 

yes, but there's still the problem of what we mean when we say "equality"

right, but what does "no barriers" mean in the drafting example, for instance?

i think "equality" is a much-abused term...in application it's rather messy. if women are equal, than to what extent is society obliged to mandate and monitor that equality? 

(like preferential treatments, for example

okay, but play devil's advocate a minute: don't past and some current social attitudes toward the role of women in the workplace and at home place them at a disadvantage when it comes to their careers and other things? and should people be required to redress that? 

wait, which part? 

partially. i was talking more generally than just tv, though 

right, i wouldn't say bob sagget's character is the norm 

right, but which attitudes do you think are most prevalent? 

right, but chapelle is doing something different; he reduces racist attitudes to absurdity, and makes them look ridiculous 

same thing with borat, to a certain extent 

he's kind of a blowhard 

indeed

i think we covered it okay
