i don tthink everyone would abuse it 

i know some of my friends parents will smoke casually 

wait wait im lost 

what are we arguing? 

what lifestyle problems come from smoking? 

how often? 

i have heard some people say that it kills brain cells 

kill brain cells? 

really 

i didnt know that 

do u guys know how alcohol exactly kills brain cells 

is it permanent 

no i have not 

i have never heard of that either haha 

people just abuse alcohol 

i dont agree 

i dont think it will become legalized 
oh oh ok 

yeah i dont get that 

were there any cases that proved marijuana made u a killer 

or sex fiend 

bc i feel like alcohol makes u do worse things 

yes 

good movie 

was marijuana ever legal? 

if so when did ut become illegal 

thank you 

which is? 

i think the effects of alcohol are worse 

my roomate is high right now 

and she seems the same 

hahah very true 

why is what 

weed? 
well after a night of drinking i love a slice of pizza 

and no matter where its from its good 

i dont throw up my food 

mmm pizza valla 

i think alcohol has more harmful effects then marijuana 

but if marijuana were legalized do you think people would abuse the privilege 

how much does it take to get high 

you seem to know your facts 

that seems reasonable 

taxi rides 

food 

overpaying the taxi 

where does the money go to in these underground markets 

is weed legal outside of the us? 

why did they do that 

which is 

i never thought about it that way 
i think they should focus more on those then alcohol
