Yes

i heard recently that they might have found Jesus' body? 

hahaa i guess 

i think they need to twist things alot but basically live by the same rules

times change 

uh oh 

i agree with ya frogger 

times change - you have it has to somehow adapt to thechange

it doesnt have to change its views 

the church has aldready changed from the time of Jesus 

we dont fast for days 

think they shuold become somewhat more lenient 

they are already losing members becaus of the priest issues 

in long island a whole catholic school is going to close due to lack of attendance 

i disagree 

i believe that as a catholic - u have a personal joice of how you want to worship 

choice* wow lol 
i think that if you choose not to go to church because u dont get anything out of it - thats your choice - ersonally thats how i feel but i still worship 

i agree with the paternalistic comment as well 

the world is changing, women have rights and are eqquals, why cant they be priests? 

i agree 

it made itself thousands of years ago 

yup

whats wrong with women priests? because it wasnt accepted socially a thousand yrs ago?

how do u figure 

this is about rights not sports 

so its alot different 

some women would make wonderful priests and its a shame that the church wont let them share that 

the church is lacking priests as it is - it would be a good move 

yeah they really dont 

wow yeah 

they do 

priests do make more 

a nun i feel takes more of the "giving up of possessions" role

i think its just about peter and how he was the father of the church ( i could b wrong) 

interesting

right 

does anyone regularly attend church? 

wow i agree 

good point 

yeah

hahahahha

i think it would only benefit the church 

i think they are just denying the fact they have to adapt 

yeah - i still think thats because thats what was accepted at the time 

yeah - no disrespect for Jesus - but i dont think he was looking too far ahead 

right
if we can change the ages for whom has to participate in not eating meat on fridays and we can make up rules like that - y cnt women b priests 

its for medical reaons right? 

yeah thats weird 

what do u mean 

60yrs after his death 

by parts u mean just the new testament

hahaha i hear ya 

wow interesting 

i dont like the secret aspect of the hurch 

church*

i feel like evrything is very hush hush 

yeah

right

i just feel like the church isnt a welcoming place 

it intimidates me 

my aunt got pregnant at 17 and was shunned by her church i just fel like its not as welcoming of an institution as it should be - Jesus being compassionate and all 
almost 60 

true 

very true 

yeah 

yes

just like a president 

at least he would hear more views and be more open minded (the pope) 

wait what does it have to dowith eople over 50? 

but wouldnt they want their opinions heard more? 

im not sure i understand lol 

as new priests climb the ladder - i feel like the church will naturally become more liberal 

true

yeah - i thinkeverywhere else they would want it to stay the way it is 

i think it shuld but i dont think it could 

didnt the church spit once b4 and it was chaos 

yeah

that would be interesting to see 

i feel like the euro counrties would be more reluctant to change 

u never know - we cant make assumptions 

cool 

by cool i meant interesting lol 

lol...im not sure still - u cnt make assumptions as large as this 

i believe that 

that most people want i to stay the same 

yup
