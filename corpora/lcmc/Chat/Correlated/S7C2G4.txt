lol 

thats a bunch of bull 

why are they so concerned with other ppl's lives? 

yea pretty much... 

very

lol!!! 

that was funny!!! 

i seriously dont understand why they care... 

yea we are 

that makes me feel alot better when i think about 

yea they arent but slowly they are realizes that our generation is gonna do whateva we want and we dont care 

realizing*

i kno 

exactly i feel that thats our generations motto 

our generation is not concerned with other ppls lives like the older generation is

but those ppl dont represent us though 
so tru 

me and u spacestare!!! 

u taking the words right out of my mouth 

i kno 

sometimes i feel that sometimes gays arent seen as humans but the govt 

or maybe even less than human 

just becuz of their lifestyle 

tru 

lol

lol!!! 

maybe if they called it a union and gave it the smae rights as marriage then we would be able to mov eon 

ohhh

good pt 

it is 

yea

thats kinda hard 

i kno 

if they gave a civil union the same rights as a marriage and jus changed the name

im just saying to settle this whole issue and move on to something more important 

compromise?

oh i kno 

im a big compromise person 

yeah!!! seperation of church and state!!! 

and isnt marriage in the constitution or something

livingdeadbeat!!!! 

wow!!! 

i totally agree!!! 

wat?? 

conservative was left wing - liberalism was right wing??? 

ohh ok 

lol! 

at all 

lol

they are supposed to be tryin to ban gay rights also 

a step forward??? 

wow ok! 

Oh

i was so lost 

why?

Maybe

and plus you can still fill out forms to recieve all the benefits of a marriage

naw

nt at all 

im just thinkin about the problems that would come with that 

like i read this story 

oh and one of the girls got into an accident where she cant speak

therefore her father doesnt like the idea of her being in a homosexual relationship so he cuts her partner ff 
off*

and he can do that becuz technically he is still her guardian 

oh but it is 

the govt allowed for the father to do that 

they totally overlooked the fact that they were partners 

exactly

like in their upper 30s 

exactly

theres alot more to the story but thats the basics 

yea there are alot of statics and court cases 

no... the judge finally realized that they were better off together so they waited three years to be reunited becuz of her father's decision

lol

aight wateva slim

becuz guys are supposed to masucline and strong and too guys kissing is implyin that one is feminine 

maybe? 

lol!!! 

Nsa?

wats nsa though? 

lol 

are we done??? 

done!!!
