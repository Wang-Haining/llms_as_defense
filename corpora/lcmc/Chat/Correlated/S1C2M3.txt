i agree, but then it needs to be better observed 

they need to have better oversight of who they are selling it to 

the discussion starter said that there were few guidelines for buyers and sellers, they should be stricter about it if its not legal 

yeah 

like we sait its still going to be used no matter if its legal or not 

i agreee 

exactly

yeah

i agree, those who would use are doing it already 

but how many people would really start up because it was legal? think about the large percentage of kids who drink even though they are underage and that is illegal 

yeah arent they drug tested

agreed 

yeah

an age limit 

well dont be drunk at work so dont be high at work? 

its harder to tell if someone is high then drunk 

so i guess unless you were doing something that got you in trouble in the first place and then were drug tested you wouldnt necessarily be caught 

yeah

but if it was legal then you just cant be high at work?

yeah definitly 

so its the same. you can go to work high at the risk of getting caught
