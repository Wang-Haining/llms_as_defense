Super

sure they do 

but isnt that obvious, i mean its the least progressive christian sect 

aside from orthodox evangelicals and wackjobs 

well when the good catholics setting the examples are fondeling 14 year old boys ... 

yea seems a bit harsh 

in the old days you could give the church all your money in order for some repentance haha

humm so anyhow is being gay still a sin to the church 

haha

nah i missed it 

but i am sure it was ironically done and acurate in most regards

believe what? 

that there is a gay way to pray?

 haha ahh right well that is the whole rejection of science aspect of the church

its biological 

but what is biology when you are making the laws of Catholicism

science is hardly taken into consideration with regards to the churches stance on gay marriage that is all im saying 

sure if we have it at our disposal why not use it 

just another microcosm of the churches lack of progression

hahahahha 

haha yea that wont happen 

yea i sadly agree, the church has larger issues in my opinion

gays, abortion 

i think abortion transcends religion in many ways, obviously catholics hold a special strong stance against it but it is also dependent on socio economic status as well 

they are big fans of teen pregnancy and std's 

yep

haha touche 

those surgeries are stupid becuase they mess with more than just a mans want for sex they screw up all kinds of natural flows in the body 

sure they should marry 

women priests is a better first priest issue
