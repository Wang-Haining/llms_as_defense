I think that there are certain things that could be changed, but at the same time I think it's important to have something that remains relatively steadfast in this fast-paced world of the 21st century 

what groups of people were you talking about mtnbike?/ 

how are they not accepting of non-catholics? 

do they shun them? 

or discriminate against them? 

Muslims say that you have to pray 5 times a day and make a pilgrimmage to Mecca etc. in order to be saved 

do you have a problem with them as well? 

or for that matter, all institutionalized religions? 

who says there is a heaven? 

excuse me, knows

besides, if someone tells you that you're not going to heaven, and they don't have any direct power over you, why would you care? 

exactly, so what's your problem with the Catholic Church then? 

go for it 

Actually, doctors of the Church like Thomas Aquinas claim that we can't know anything about God, God is a mystery 
Interesting

it seems to me like mtnbike has a problem with the Catholic Church in all centuries 

not just the 21st, please correct me if I'm wrong 

well then, if we may agree to disgree about the validity of institutionalized religions, and just accept their existence, perhaps we can return to the issue at hand, which is, what about the Catholic Church conflicts with the 21st century, and should the Church change its ways to conform

so fasting is at odds with the 21st century

I agree 

I think that there are members of the Church who do accept gay people

i agree 

I also feel that women should be allowed to participate in the hierarchal administration of the Church 

I mean, especially with the shortage of priests that exists in this country, I think that women should have the opportunity to become priests 

Yes

Yes

that's a good question, I don't know the answer 
ah, so you feel that they couldn't adequately peform their duties if they had to take care of a family as well? 

not everyone has a family 

i mean, spouse and children 

you see, the docrine of requiring priests to remain celibate was a product of the 12th century 

before then, priests were usually married 

but in the 12th century, the Catholic Church became very powerful and gained a lot of land 

married priests who died left children whose right it was to have the land 

but the Catholic Church wanted to hold on to that land 

hence, they decided to ban priests from marrying 

seeing as this ban is a product of the greedy, corrupt 12th century Catholic Church 

I wonder if its all that necessary in the 21st century 

I mean, people also used the argument you mentioned before Janada, even back then, but money and land were the main factors in the decision

If I may add, the Catholic Church has allowed certain men, who were formally reverends in a Protestant faith with a wife and children, to convert to the Catholic faith and become priests
so, perhaps this is a sign of change to come 

i'm not sure why 

i can't explain it, but my dad knows one of these priests 

i just thought that I'd throw it out there 

how do you mean? 

well, neither do I 

it's just a horrible tragedy 

unfortunately, one that seems like it could've been somewhat prevented

it seems that certain priests and bishops knew about it for some time before it was exposed 

which is why think that the nature of the Church administration needs to change - include women 

indeed, child molestation is very much a part of the 21st century 

to uh, concur with Janada's earlier statement 

They would say that the love of God, or grace or whatever cannot be tainted by imperfect humans 

I guess my other question would be, besides the fasting that Rocketship mentioned earlier and the attitude toward homosexuality, are there any other beliefs that you think the Catholic Church should change in order to conform to life in the 21st century 

I don't exactly thik that there's a lack of people who oppose the Catholic Church 

or for that matter, institutionalized religion in general 

think*, exuse me 

well, then, I guess wel 

sorry,

i guess we'll just have to agree to disagree, is what i meant to say 

so, Rocket Ship, belief should be based on reason? 

yes some root, but entirely? 

because many doctors of the Catholic Church do make arguments in support of faith by using reason 

right, is it so wrong for people to have faith? 

or is that just taboo in the 21st century? 

ah, so now we are speaking of the Catholic Church in terms of the lay people, am I right? 

yes, those who don't belong to the holy orders

like, the priesthood, or nuns 

I think that there's so many dissenting views of Catholics within the Catholic Church that no general statement can be made about them 

If I may add something about the positive role the Church plays in the 21st century, it is the source of some of the greatest amounts of service performed 

If I may add something about the positive role the Church plays in the 21st century, it is the source of some of the greatest amounts of service performed 

indeed i hope it doesn't 

and I think that the Church's humanitarian role extends even further, to the defense of life, and I think that their stance on issueds like abortion and the death penality and war are important to our society in the 21st century as well
