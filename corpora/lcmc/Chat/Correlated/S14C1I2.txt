maybe some deprovements 

im glad they got saddam since he was such a big threat...ten years ago 

my comment was a joke 

btrw

they dont exist 

faulty intelligence 

rather, they invented them so they could invade 

Go massive . . . Sweep it all up. Things related and not.

we should care, there gonna come after us 

be careful with your use of "they" 

before categorizing all Middle Easterners as terrorists 

so give more money to the failing homeland security? 

i mean the patriot act has already done enough damage, and we already have the capability to destroy anyone in the world..how are we going to "protect" ourselves? 

easier said then done 

i mean how do you get out of quicksand when youre sunk past your head? 

Phew

i was worried 

jk

hours after 9/11 rumsfeld had notes recorded that have recently been found that said "judge whether good enough [to] hit S.H. at same time" and "Go massive . . . Sweep it all up. Things related and not." 

mine says 8:19 btw 

yea rumsfeld

they were fired or quit before they were fired

well it takes a lot more for an presidential impeachment trial then lets say, firing an attorney general 

and while we are in the middle of the war that would be seen both as a waste of time and money, and our enemies would certainly jump

yeah he has more than 2 

you dont think a presidential impeachment trial and the disunity of our country would be enough for enemies to increase attacks? 

so we can impeach Bush? 

or afghanistan 

and hey guess what groups were formed after Russia's withdrawal?

the same groups that drove planes into WTYC 

WTC

and you dont think there would be one sympathetic arms dealing rich Arab to spawn more terrorist groups? 

basically after russia withdrew from afghanistanin the late 80's, a group was formed that eventually became the Taliban, and were debating whether or not this could happen with Iraq 

but the question is, which is worse 

yet if we kickstart their economy and try to get them on their feet, the likelihood of repeated attacks grows smaller 

but if there is no feasible way to do that... 

then we should consider pulling out 

and we obv aren't going to find out our options 

why cant we pull out if they cant find an answer? 

im saying we should try first 

with a godawful administration

bush...idiot, rumsfeld...asshole, ashcroft...are you noticing a trend 

well thats poor decision making 

that cant be reversed 

i wonder if everyone in congress laughs when someone accidently says tit

that would be sweet 

 A March 7, 2007 survey of more than 2,000 Iraqis commissioned by the BBC and three other news organizations found that 51% of the population found attacks on coalition forces "acceptable," up from 17% in 2004 and 35% in 2006.

i dont know, i just thought that was an interesting statistic 

it means the US and our allies 

Bush dubbed everyone going in with us as the coalition of the willing 

you know the more i think about this 

the more i feel this shouldnt be the US's decision 

well what i mean is 

i mean they can blame us 

cuz we went in there 

hold on frankie...im supporting you here 

haha 

if we supported them from outside the country with just financial and economic aid, and whatever else they need, then they cant hate us for that reason

well obviously if the government goes against their word and doesnt provide aid, we cant help that, but in theory it could work 

well thats why it shouldnt be completely monetary

if we rebuild a school that we destroyed...theres a step 

if we subsidize businesses we trust the economy could be jumpstarted

right now we are just occupying and trying to implant our own government, our own presidents and democracy into their country 

we are trying to force American belief systems and political presence in a country whose Islamic population doesnt mesh at all with what we are trying to force on them 

and for some reason our country doesnt understand that not everywhere in the world do citizens want to be more ilke americans 

or not, if they dont want to 

if the Qur'an is their source of constitution, so be it 

right before 9, too...
