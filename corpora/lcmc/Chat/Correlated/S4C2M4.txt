I think if it becomes completley legalized, some of the thrill of using an illegal drug will dissipate 

If you only allow small amounts, that thrill will still be there 

so people will want to abuse it more 

But marijuana isnt addictive like cocaine or marijuana 

cocaine or heroine i meant to say 

ii'm pretty sure its illegal 

nicotine is probably worse 

I think there's a taboo surrounding marijuana 

Just because its a "drug" doesnt mean its a horrible thing 

I work in a hospital pharmacy, and we occassionally have THC in capsule fom 

for glaucoma patients and AIDS patients 

Not if its completely legalized 

maybe at first, but eventually, the novelty will wear off 

If its legal like ibuprofen or robitussin, theres no thrill of using it 

In theory, yes 

Look at Amsterdam 

Locals there don't walk around stoned all day 

even though its legal 

it would probably shift to other drugs 

It probably is, but I think that depends more on the person than anything else 

def not 

There are plenty of legal drugs that are way worse 

i feel like the government doesnt want to legalize it because that would look like a loss in the war on drugs 

sleeping pills are not OTC 

I think marijuana has been extensivley studied 

i think you'd be surprised 

nope

yeah

if there is an age, its gotta be 18 

that should be 18 too 

you can die for your country when youre 18 

why not be able to drink? 

not anytime soon 

i agree 

eating can be attributed to way more deaths than alcohol 

I think the difference is that marijuana is not really harmful to you

Exactly

well sure 

Yeah, and I feel like the government feels the same way but doesnt want to give in 

But who would grow it?
