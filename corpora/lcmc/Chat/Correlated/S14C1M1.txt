yeah 

yeah im a little confused with the wording of the whole statement, actually

same with cigarettes 

i feel that drug policy in america is skewed and that even if it continues to remain criminalized, the least the government can do is practice a policy of non-enforcement

and no, you can't physically overdose on pot, it would take smoking 21 blunts within an hour to reach ld50 

the lethal dosage of any drug 

it probably wouldnt stop them 

but the war on drugs is perhaps more harmful itself then without it 

if drug trade was regulated we could also probably work on getting south american countries out of the deep poverty state theyre currently in

lol

well lets say that, hypothetically speaking, we had an administration that cared... 

because its economic 

and were isolationist 

we dont do things unless it benefits us 

not really true, but lets move on 

i dont think the difference between recreational use and medical use matters 

"drugs" is a large group 

recent studies have been coming out saying that are highly critical of the original studies on marijuana, didnt consider ofher factors, and were conducted poorly 

well that can possibly be true, but personal experience isnt scientific

what do you mean by that 

and its not now? 

40% of americans have already tried it

Haha

spacestare, if i were to offer you a blunt, would it matter to you whether it was legal or illegal 

i feel like a persons attitudes towards drugs is based more on conditions surrounding you, how you were brought up, your morals...this doesnt changed based on government precedent 

thats ecstacy 

not marijuana 

right
ok
well how do they deal with being "high" in public know because its clearly not legal 

*now 

umm your probably not gonna go right to jail 

also, if its legal, people will be less likely to move into harder, illegal drugs

think about it 

if you're willing to try marijuana now while its illegal, the chance that you will try more drugs (since your already doing illegal things) will be greater 

and your throwing up and feeling nausea and the only way to get rid of these symptoms and feel normally is to shoot up again

there are no withdrawal symptoms with marijuana 

thats why its not a problem 

because science proves it 

you cant deny that there arent withdrawal symptoms though 

so how can you say youve seen different? 

youve seen them try to quit and been unable to? 

seriousely try to quit? 

what were the effects? 
*silenct clap* 

iraq sweet
