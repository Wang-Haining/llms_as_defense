Yep

Lol

looking at it just from the standpoint of something you smoke, ignoring the other effects, i would say no 

haha oh well 

i don't think i have... 

not while they're doing it at least 

i heard smoking pot was worse than cigarettes 

i guess it depends on where you get it then 

well thats good... 

pot as fertilizer

nice

lol 

yeah

u can't really mass produce pot 

wait wait 

so then the government would be the supplier of pot?
but the government doesn't control alcohol companies 

oh ok, yeah 

i wouldn't 

but i don't smoke 

yeah

yeah 

the thing is, they said they wanted to legalize it in small amounts 

who determines what a small amount is though?

and whats to stop someone from buying over the limit? 

Haha

yeah, so i think tacking that on to the end to make people feel better is useless

wasn't there something about hallucinating? 

oh ok 

yeah, if they make it legal they'd really have to put strict regulations about purity

ive never heard of that 

yeah 

but they do for alcohol too 

the effects vary -- sorry i was late lol 

do they have like a breathalizer for pot or something so they can tell if you've been driving high? 

Wow

tru dat lol 

yeah that seems pretty random 

to have that be ok but pot illegal 

i can kind of believe that they would do better if they were relaxed 

i guess as long as it was proved there were no long term health effects and it was well regulated, i would be ok with pot being legalized 

haha yeah 

i dont think it is really clear 

well alcohols effects come from overuse

tobaccos can come from moderate use 

you don't have to smoke 5 packs a day to get lung cancer 

ik, thats what makes it worse 

i kind of think it should be more regulated 

like there should be a limit on cigarette purchases or something

yeah

if they say they can do it for pot, why not tobacco? 

hahaha 

i have no idea how much tobacco would be considered a healthy dose 

well i dont think banning cigs would go over well 

haha

pretty much 

yeah 

either treat it like alcohol or keep it illegal 

yes

it still impairs your reflexes 

right

well there's people who drive ok when they're drunk too 

maybe he just hasn't run into a situation yet where he would notice how it affects him 

no... 

i think its a personal call as to morals 

its just a judgement call as to what u want to do to your body

i mean, you know the risks 

and if you feel guilty for putting yourself in danger of lung cancer or whatever, then its morally wrong for you 

yeah, definitely 

it would have to come with its own little surgeon general's warning 

thats not necessarily true 

i know research is going on at this school on psilocybin, the main chemical in magic mushrooms 

yeah, then they should fund more research 

lol 

there have to be some long term health effects 

then they really need to before this becomes legal 

haha i was confused too 

true, and then they could tax it and stuff 

well its got to go through some company before it can be sold
true

but they might disappear after a while --- i mean, you don't hear so much about bootleggers anymore, right? 

yeah, there will always be some 

well, if it was too expensive, economically the companies would lower their prices 

i don't think the price of pot will be a huge deal 

and they could grow huge fields of it, so it would be easier for them to go cheaper 

but all pot would have to be regulation if it was legal 

so wouldn't it not matter as much who you get it from? 

well they'd just be taking a risk, they wouldnt know exactly what they were getting 

haha true 

you could buy your mom a pot growing chia pet for mothers day 

you did in the 20s for alcohol too 

true

lol 

i think newbies to the pot scene would buy it legit from stores

and eventually old customers who were faithful to dealers would get old and stuff... 

yeah, it'll probably never disappear 

haha

so 21 would be the agreed on age? 

true, govt always puts money first lol 

right

lol 

pot = ok, after lots of research 

just so people can be totally informed 

well... we can't say how much you can buy at once 

but you can put limits on how much is on your person i guess 

gotcha

super duper gang 

same

bye!
