eh, i do 

only when they call it marriage 

marriage is strictly one man one woman, i don't see a problem with a gay couple though 

right

if a gay couple wants to be recognized by the state as a couple i think thats okay too just not a married couple 

right

yeah

well, when i hear marriage i think of the sacramen not being recognized as a couple by the state or govt 

i guess - for me as a catholic however - thats what i think of, so thats just my take on it 

yes, however i think for a gay marriage since it is and has not been the norm should change what they call it 

i agrree 

i think they should just use a different word for marriage, maybe to just humor the catholics! 

i just think not calling it marriage would ease alot of tensions 

i think the only reason marriage is sacred because it is within the church, the church doesnt even recognize marriages that dont take place within the church

i agree on that 

true but why should it be all about the govt? why should the church have to recognize these unions 

so was mine lol 

right

but why?

but why? 

Agreed

Exactly

woah what lol 

i dont think the gov has to use to terms 

why cant the church use marriage reffering to their members and the state use somethin else for everyone

right

i think the gov is being influenced way to much by religion 

right i agree with the marriage part 
i think if they do what we just agreed on - calling it somethin else- then gays could still "get married" just use a different term 

right

well we know already that the church bands gay marriage 

they shouldnt i disagree with them doing that 

i agree 

thats if we leave it as marriage 

the work must be changed 

i agree 

nope

i see no problem with your friend wanting to live a normal life like that

so we all agree just to change the word marriage? 

Right
I agree

Right

i agree on that 

politicians are being supportive of it or not supportive based on where they need votes - i think 

politicians are also siding with celebrities like rosie odonnell to gain support of fans 

true but they also want to go higher and they want the vote 

i mean just her views 

doesnt she change her mind alot?? 

whats everyones take on gay's adopting? (are we allowed to switch topics!?) 

I see no problem with it 

agreed 

why does the kid automatically have to be gay// 

you said as a kid if you're gay

well i meant have the discrimination involving gays since his parents are

right

yes

but it is not my place to say that they cannot be who they are 

littlestanemone said that there are alot more things that gross her out so i said well on the topic of society, i think only a man and a woman shuold be together

right, we are in a transition process with this issue 
true

true

i think environment deffinitly has something to do with it though 

what/

i know alot of feminine boys 

but they are certainly not gay 

sometimes

right 

ahhaaha i would laugh 

nope 

whay/

why*? 

has anyone ever witnessed discrimination against gays? 

? 

Same
its horrible 

i cant imagine going through high school in todays society 
o wow 

thats true

my friend went to an all boys school 

thats all it was about 

picked what up? 

o okay 

id agree with that - i think girls would be more sensitive to the fact 

says the guy - id hope the girl would say niether 

thats weird 

lol 

great
