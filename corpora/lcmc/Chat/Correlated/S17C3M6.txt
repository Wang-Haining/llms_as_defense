i think its hard to legalize it for medicinal use only. how do you enforce that?

some states did? 

oh wow thats a while ago 

yeah, it's a big draw to going abroad for some people 

but its a lot more accessible 

but i think unless you had reason to be searched, you could easily get away with carrying large amounts 

so how does anyone become a dealer? 

yeah i just think its bad enough so that it shouldnt be legal 

staying power? 

its more harmful to you than alcohol i mean 

it can cause breathing problems, heart palpitations, memory loss 

and cancer just like smoking 

which is interesting bc tobacco is legal in any amount 

but it doesnt mean its effects are less - you just smoke less because it's stronger 

amount? 

why not? 

so people don't go out of control 

that's true... but I don't know if it's always a good idea. I think less people might have dies of alcohol poisoning if there had been an enforced limit. 

do you think legalizing it will minimize its use? 

there won't be that thrill factor 

so thats not you motivation for legalizing it? I think it is a common argument for its legalization

true

but then it will wear off 

so goldeneye, what are your reasons for wanting it legaliuzed? 

Okay

but i think they are already in the same category of illegal drugs, so if one becomes legal, others might too 

i think it would or could follow 

i have a question for the group 

is the fact that marijuanaa gatweay drug a reason why you would not want it legalized? 

i don't know about that.. i thin kit's addictive qualities are the same regardless of its legal status 
ok

i guess i mean the fact that it could lead to other drugs 

nope
