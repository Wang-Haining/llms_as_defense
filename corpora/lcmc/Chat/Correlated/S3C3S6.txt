it's definitely still here, but disappearing slowly 

probably not 

but it makes us feel better to have laws and stuff now

haha

do you think there's a gender bias against men at all? 

like in nursing and stuff? 

Aww

lol 

there are male secretary jokes? 

Haha

Hahaha

thats true 

i think dah is right, some jobs just suit one sex more 

but that doesnt mean someone of the opposite sex should be made uncomfortable for choosing a job like that 

right 

but if they did, it should be easy for them 
hey thats fine, i hope i'll never be a construction worker, personally 

some women are 

i guess 

absolutely

do you think women construction workers are ever denied promotion because they're women? 

ahhh i GUESS we should be, if the draft is reinstated 

well im sure most men dont want to be drafted either, but they dont have a choice 

definitely not, but i mean isn't there a screening process or something after you're drafted? 

(talking about women being cut out for war) 

thinking in terms of helping our country: every soldier counts, and a lot of women would be perfectly capable of fighting for the country 

thats how i think anyhow 

obviously you couldn't send a husband and a wife both off to war...

yeah lol 

there would be a lot to take into account 

well... but if they were going to choose to be in the army they would just enlist 

im not saying only the few capable should go on if they were drafted 

im saying those who meet requirements should go on 

same with men 

whoever fits the profile 

right

which is why not a tont of women are in the military now

ton*

but every little bit helps 

not when it comes to killing people.... 

lol

how many women serial killers and assassins are there? 

lol 

true

i mean, there was a reason that separation happened int he first place 

true

but if you dont use it, you lose

so maybe because of their nurturing roles, even if they started out the same as men, many women dont have the capability any more to be ok with killing 

well, we have evolved over the years 

gaining some skills and losing others 

so i dont know 

yes 

but most of them are able to reconcile it because they feel its their duty and they did a good thing 

are women able to accept it in the same way? 

never having killed anyone.... i woulodn't know 

wouldn't*

i think womens instinct lies more in going and getting the man to protect them rather than fighting themselves 

but i cant make a generality for everyone at all 

hahaha i know 

women stereotype themselves 

haha
then what needs to change the most is the way women view themselves 

i think 

at least 

right 

we want all the good things that men have and none of the bad 

haha

there is way less opposition to women advancing 

yeah 

right 

but they should also have the same opportunity to climb ranks in the army as men 

i guess thats mostly what people think of in equality 

they should be judged by the same standards 

and ambitious in general 

men are* 

more* 

true

ahhhhh another stereotype 

this sucks 

well a lot of women can

on the flipside 

lol 

women should be equal to men in the same way that races are equal

but the laws and protection trying to make that happen should be the same

well that will just sort itself out on its own 

its not like there wouldbe laws forcing a certain number of women to go into construction or the military 

its just that the women who choose that should be respected

hey, i vote that the draft not be reinstated at all, for anyone lol 

right

and that they can move up the ladder from construction worker to supervisor or whatever if they have the ability 

i think thats all we could really ask for 

definitely a woman shouldnt be given a job over a man with more skill just to aid "equality" 
i dont get it... 

right.... 

there's lots of variety in sitcoms 

haha thats trueee.... 

so they made him womanly? 

oh oh! 

what about king of queens? 

she has a higher paying, white collar job

and her husband's a truck driver 

exactly 

and that helps things change 

because the more people see it, the more they get used to it 

i think they affect the way people think 

but i think there's a trend that they're affecting it in a good way

yeah 

i mean, a blatantly racist, sexist sitcom would never get on the air today 

yeah
welllllll... 

lol 

ok fine 

but they just kicked some radio show host off the air for a sexist, racist remark 

yeah

haha so i wonder why its fine in some settings and not in others?

True

its a parody 

same thing with the office 

yeah

wow lol 

that doesnt add to his credibility 

well its already harder to listen to howard stern 

yeah, same 

absolutely

these things do take time 

yayyy

haha

oh the future is so bright for humanity... 

true that 

yeah

and higher authorities like nbc and the govt are helping, not protecting those who wtill discriminate 

yayyy equality 

mayyybe...

i like people
