Yup

Opening thought - allowed, but under state not church

To some extent, even under church - we can get to that though.

Agreed, but I hear recently the Episcopal church is making a turn 

which is splitting apart their organization 

Half and half 

The International Episcopal church has one leader in the NorthEast who has proclaimed he is gay

and some congregations have agreed to follow him while others - especially internationally- have threatened to split off 

Really interesting though, to see atleast some other congregations following him 

True, but it hits the gay topic within the Church 

Shoot

Ideally, I wish it would be allowed internationally, but to truly work, I think state by state or country by country, the decision shoudl be made

What I do no understand is how gay people can be condemned to hell, yet made in the image and likeness of this good God 

No true 

Not 

Jesus says the only sin unforgiveable is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit 

Others are foregiven with the chance for salvation 

Ok, so why can't you ask for foregiveness then 

In a legal sense, it should be allowed 

THen I do not understand your previous point

How they are condemned to Hell

It's not blasphemy against the Holy Spirit 

Exactly 

and I believe the Church supports that 

as long as their is some motive not to act upon it 

Right, outside the church, it should be completely legal - to act on and everything 

A traditional society is still catching up 

Same reason slavery was not abolished over night 

Disagree

I am no scientist, but hear it is part of the genetical code 

Precisely
This all leads me back to my question about why the church could condemn it - if we are all "made in the image and likeness of a good God", how can these people be sinning. Perhaps we are really sinning for not accepting them in the Church. 

Thanks, any insight? 

I am truly clueless on that point 

Definitely, with the same moral tradition, but allow this open sexuality

Yes, especially if evidence is true that it is a piece of our genetic make-up

it would be like therapy for read hair as mntbike would say 

Can you explain that 

I can agree with that 

Yes 

No sir 

Yea, friends, though 

I can see that how you were brought up can make you think it's right or wrong, but as you grow older you should wrestle with the idea in a more intellectual manner 

Much, again, like the idea of slavery 

I do not see any problem with it
The rich part of life is diversity, who says we should all have a "perfect" mother/father bringing up 

How so? 

In that sense maybe yes, but who says that is the ultimate way to be raised. You can have the same loving collaboration from same sex parents

I think so 

I read an interesting article the other day that too many people go in to marriage expecting to always feel the same feelings they had at the beginning for the rest of their marriage. That is seems to set the marriage to doom as feelings are a fleeting thing. Perhaps if more people cherished the actual bond and search for ideals beyond feelings the rate would come down

I think it's that ^ 

Me?

there is an initial feeling which we call love, people expect that to last throughout marriage even though feelings are a fleeting experience. We have to find something beyond that feeling of "love". Love seems to be ill-defined

There are certainly feelings associated with it 

but how can you base a life-long relationship on feelings

Feelings are not lasting 

True
Ridiculous

A government is supposed to support the interests of its people, not stand in the way 

It's not like the citizens are asking to carry around bazookas

Which should be separated from the State 

All true 

All true 

not logical ones 

Not to say they can't be one in the same at times

True, and instead of putting the work into correcting those issues, the government wants an amendment to simplify things 

They would not have to deal with the legal issues discussed by Klutzo, because a ban would be in place 

I am not entirely sure, but I would say many are much further behind us 

True

but when you get to some of the far eastern cultures with deeper traditions, it seems like it would be further behind us 

Yes 

I think all of our points up until now support that: there is a separation a state and church, genetic makeup, etc...

Government is to support the interests of the people, not crush them 

So were some against slavery 

hopefully moral righteousness wins out 

Absolutely

Part of it, as has be discussed, is a mixing of Church beliefs and State 

My final thought is that gay marriage should eventually be legalized internationally, but to get there we need a state-by-state or country-by-country drive to legalize it. It is part of our natural genetic make up and should not rely on the interests of any religion 

But a law is a step in the right direction, atleast they will have their rights
