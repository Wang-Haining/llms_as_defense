I was against it for a while, but I eventually decided there is no reason for it to be illegal 

The government really has no authority in deciding what is and is not marriage.

Hmm... 

Well I changed my mind after I thought about it for a while lol 

Obviously that is still the case, but since it is not the choice of the individual to be gay, I don't think they should be denied love just because they were born a certain way. 

True

If it were the choice of the individual, it would be different, yes. If everyone chose to be gay, then noone would reproduce. And we can't have that. ") 

Well hey, if you really want to think far into this.... if you say it is okay to do something, then you have to say it is okay for EVERYONE to do it 

Crash, I think we are hypothetically thinking that being gay is a personal choice, yes 

The gay gene 

Theres a talk here about it, I assume they have found it? 

Yep 

Hey, I have a question. Do you think the government has the right to decide what a real "marriage" is? And where does religion fall in

I don't believe it is a personal choice either. It wouldn't make any sense for it to be personal choice. Who would choose a life of discrimination? 

And have to go through the whole process of revealing it to your parents and everything. 

yeah goldeneye...especially if you go back father into history when it was SO much more socially unacceptable 

Well.... go back far enough and it was commonly practiced as well. 

It would make a lot more sense to me for it to be genetic. There would not be nearly as many homosexuals if it were not

Therefore, it is like any other trait, and should not be discriminated against. 

lol 

The gay gene! 

I have to go to that talk lol I'm interested to know 

Oh 

lol 

so hey... answer my question 

Do you think the government has the right to decide what a real "marriage" is? And where does religion fall in? 

I am thinking more of just a union. I never thought about the legal implications, really. 

If gay marriage is okay, then I think it should be the same process as straight marriage. If you do not allow homosexuals to get married "legally," but allow them to just be in a "union" or whatever, it still is NOT equal. 

It's just kind of... shutting them up. 

The Catholic Church is working on celibacy and female priests right now, I believe.

Is that true? 

Ah 

So is there anyone opposed to gay marriage here? I heard someone say it before. If so, lets get some debate going! 

I feel like they should not have the right to "decide," however. 

They should just "provide" the process. 

Yes

They never had to "endorse" straight marriage. It was always, naturally, there. Therefore, there should be no debate. As long as being gay is genetic, it is not something that should be discriminated against. 

Well, what gives them the right to decide it is "wrong," if it is not by choice. 

Providing the process involves no moral judgment, which I believe they have no right to make in an issue like this one. 

(did that make sense?) 

what sort of environmental factors? 

Hey, my parents are divorced, and I grew up in a house with all women. I turned out just fine, I think.

Is that the kind of thing we mean? 

Not having both sexes around

? 

rocks, what do you mean? 

Well that goes back to whether it is genetic or not 

I do believe that people (teenagers, especially) can be influenced by something like that, and either become confused or, trying to be rebellious, "think" that they are gay. 

Yes clockwatcher, to me it would. 

If it is proven to be just a choice and nothing more, then I say cut it out. 

It is not "natural" then, not something that is in your nature (your genetic code!). 

If it is genetic, then that is just horrible, horrible torture for anyone to go through. 

Well, then again, even it is genetic, I think a person can get confused during hard times in their life.

Right, even if someone is confused, I guess it would be better for them to discover their true feelings on their own. 

Or maybe with the gay gene, there will be a way to test it

What if someone does not have the gay gene and wants to be gay? Should that person's parents seek psychiatric help for him/her? 

Definitely

Thanks.

I think I would say yes. 

Because, again, it is not "natural" for that person. 

Well, I was assuming it was a proven gene that could be tested without a doubt. 

Being gay is A-okay! Hurray!
