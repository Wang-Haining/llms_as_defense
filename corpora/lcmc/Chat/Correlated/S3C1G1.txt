i think the marriage part is a call for religions to make 

yeah

but i dont see a reason why they cant be legally married

different religions can make the call on whether they'll recognize it or not 

yeah

true

and "marriage" according to the government carried more benefits and rights than civil unions 

thats true 

and the word makes a big difference in a legal sense too

civil unions don't have the same rights as marriages - and i think it doesn't matter what churches choose to do, but legally gay couples deserve the same rights as heterosexual couples 

haha

or they could give more rights to people in civil unions, and wait for religions to sort out their take on everything 

it does help society out financially, but gay couples contribute to society in the same ways straight couples do so they deserve all the same breaks 

sorry, that was way late lol 
they don't, churches have all the right in the world to not recognize gay couples as members, if thats what they really want to do 

well then they should come up with a legal word for marriage and apply it to all couples getting married 

and the church can continue to use marriage 

as long as the same word applies to hetero and homosexual couples, i'd be ok with it

thats what i was thinking, yeah 

yeah 

i think it's totally uncalled for 

no, they shouldn't be able to ban marriage 

even as a church term 

that should be up to the churches 

yeah but – 

they want to ban the idea of gays living together in a legal way similar to marriage

so why wouldn't they just put a ban on the new term for it 

well that's pretty much what they're trying to do 

a government ban on gay marriage isn't leaving it to the churches

yea 

a little 

i had a gay friend in high school, and i know he wanted to get married someday and have a family 

ik lol good job 

and there shouldn't be

just mean, it's one thing if he can't get married in the church, but another for the government to say "no, you aren't a real couple

yeah, change the word 

that would make a lot of people feel better, i think, and right now some sort of compromise has to happen 

well yeah, you can't tell the church what to do 

i'm not saying we should change the name of a holy sacrament lol 

thats true, they try to stir up emotion over it on purpose 

i think so too 

good question 

yeah, but they know how strongly to push an issue based on public opinion 
wow

thats actually pretty devious if the politicians had that in mind when they put out the referendum 

and i'm sure they did 

no, i don't follow hillary so much... 

ah, that's nice 

i think there'll be the same mix of gay parents, good and bad, as there are stright parents 

yeah

they probably will, but i think eventually it will pass

having divorced parents used to bring gossip too 

now, it's not unusual at all 

yeah 

not really 

there's things that gross me out a lot worse than the thought of two men or women being together 

thats just me though 

i think in 100 years noone will be grossed out by it, because it will have been in the open and everything longer 

oh boy - nature vs. nurture

i dont think that one's really ever going to be solved 

haha 

it's a little nature and a little nurture i think 

why's that?? 

who knows 

well, animals do a lot of things differently than we do though 

the way our minds work adds a whole other dimension to all of our life choices 

i would be a little weirded out just to see animals having sex... 

no

yeah

high school was pretty awful for my gay friend 

our school was catholic, and a lot of people who went there were conservative

thats true too 

the worst of it was the football players whose parents were anti-gay
because they picked it up at home, and they had the testosterone

picked up all the anti-gay sentiment 

about how it was unnatural, and a sin, and weird and all that 

lol 

i've heard so many guys say that.... 

lol i don't understand what's so hot about girls making out 

but thats just me 

hahaha
