well as far as the seperation of church and state issue, i think the state's definition of marriage should be made without any church's (catholic or otherwise) input

so even if a catholic (like me) sees the *sacrament* of marriage as a man and woman, i dont see why other people cant have a ceremony and call it the same thing 

i dont think the country is that stupid where we can't differentiate the tow 

?

Why

Yea

well thats not very intelligent 

i mean, one of the main talking points is society with this issue is the catholics anal retentive way of saying "the bible defines marriage as..." where other religions just don't give a %^&* 

couldn't tell you 

i dont know 

aforementioned catholics being the "bad" ones 

i would guess, yea 

there do exist christian sects that allow gay marriages 

not sure, it came up in the group discussions 

one person was from a religion where it was acceptable 

christian religion 

i thought so 

although some fundamentalist christians and catholics aren't exactly on the same page

lol

 ...because of the seperation of church and state? 

i dunno 

haha

well i think we're all agreed on the ridiculous-ness of the argument 

hm

well i just think it's interesting 

if one family can't give it to them, why not let another 

cause if you think about it, adoption is the main way a gay couple would get children 

what about man/man? 

surrogate mother 

thats just creepy 

lol

thats not even a gay issue 

surrogate mothers freak me out 

i know, thats why i said it wasn't even a gay issue 

straight mothers use sperm banks too 

soo 

whats up 

well the genetic thing is interesting, but the "frogs are gay" argument is stupid

homosexuality in animals does exist, but some animals also eat their own shit

humans are on a different plane 

haha, exactly 

good point xyz 

yea nicole, are we good? any other talking points 

well just cause its biological doesnt mean anything 

a lot of them already accept that, and say it's a 'disease' 

like colorblindness 

well their argument is

god has given you a difficult cross to bear, so if you aren't attracted to the opposite sex than you are destined for a life of chastity 

or to go into the priesthood 

which, as we know, has yielded some awful circumstances 

wait whats up? 

can you clarify that 

well why are some people born with birth defects? 

thats what they think 

its some kind of birth defect 

but it does say you have to get married to a member of the other sex 

i agree its unfair, but im just trying to defend them for the sake of the discussion 

that i agree 

very good point 

yea, ive run out of defensive manuveurs for them lol 

nicole?

k
