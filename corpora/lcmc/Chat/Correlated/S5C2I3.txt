i guess bc im not over there or experiencing its effects, i dont know what to think 

i feel safer that the troops are over there and the fighting is not going on over here 

have they actually stabilized the govt? 

soo basically they are never going to get along 

is that why people want the troops remvoed 

what is bush doing 

so who did 

so were not at war? 

so why do we call it a war 

so which of you believe we should be there? 

ave we accomplished anything from being there? 

do they have any estimates of how many americans have died?

in how many years? 

thats a lot 

how many people died when the towers were attacked

is that even possible 
so were basically stuck? 

i wouldnt like us 

i dont think it should

i feel like we are the enemy

how? 

how many troops are in iraq? 

i dont think we should give up 

i dont think there is a right way 

but if they dont know any different our ideas may be to radical for them 

i think its hard for different people to get along 

why are the leaders killed? 

what do the people in iraq want axactly 

i havent really taken an active part in trying to understand the issues in iraq

o what is the main problem

i never heard that 

if we didnt go into iraq 

: what would have happened 

well, what do you guys think would have happened 

would we have been better off not going in 

(i know we cant change things

whats going on in iran 

pulliing out of iraq isnt going to fix our issues
