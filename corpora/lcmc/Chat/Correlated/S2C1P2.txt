As long as they don't use any information collected for any other reason besides terrorism, I think that is fine. 

Well myspace is public information. 

Yeah, I don't have a problem with the NSA gathering that information. It depends on how they use it, however.

If they say they are collecting it for a certain noble cause, like the prevention of terrorism, I am okay with it. As long as that information has no chance of going public, and will not be used for any other purpose. 

Well, privacy rights in general. Like Loyola using Facebook, for instance. 

Well then I am okay with it. I will give up some of my rights for a greater cause. 

Is anyone against the patriot act? 

what do you guys think about loyola's use of Facebook

?

I believe any pictures on facebook containing "illegal activities" can incriminate the people in them. (Am I wrong?) 

Interesting point 

I was just thinking that! 

Unless there is a sign behind you that says a room number or something... 

But that could not be used as evidence against a person for a specific event 

We said that pictures can only be used as evidence in a specific case, but there is no way to link a picture to that case, right? 

Well, regardless, I think that the use of facebook is an invasion of privacy. 

myspace IS public. Facebook is meant to be a means of communication amongst students from a particular school. 

But a person on facebook can choose to keep it private, no? 

Ah, I don't use myspace. 

Well, if a myspace/facebook is set to be private (amongst a certain group of individuals), I believe it's wrong to use any information from that source. 

On the other hand, if you have a public myspace or anything of the sort, I think that is public information. 

Well, as I said, we're giving up our rights for a noble cause.

The Patriot Act is a bit different than a college using Facebook to catch kids drinking. 

Exactly.

Again, I think it depends if the information is public or not

Any information considered public, I believe anyone can use against you for any reason. If you are declaring something to the world, why complain when it comes back to bite you? 

Well the entire internet is not considered public, really

No, it shouldn't be public

Just like when you put in credit card information online or something. It is not public just because it is on the internet

Definitely.

I agree 

I know, what I mean is that we have found an issue where a certain giving up of rights is permissible on grounds of preventing terrorism. I think, however, in the future the line between the importance of privacy and crime prevention will become obscured.

That is what is up for debate, I suppose. 

Right.

Well, obviously I think the answer is yes. It's just interesting to consider how certain situations can simply trivialize our rights

Hey, how about the example of the letter found in the locker that prevented a school shooting? 

The problem is that, if we say something like that is permissible, we throw our privacy rights out the window. (I'm assuming the school had just found that letter, and did not get any tips about a school shooting) 

Unless there is cause to believe something will be found in a locker, I don't think it is ethical to search

rocks, do you mean in a school environment? 

Oh, okay. Yeah, I would agree with that

Legally, yes. 

To me, anyway.

Well, actually, whatever you put in your locker could be considered public then, in that case. Just like the internet discussion we had. 

right.

Forced invasion or privacy?

Of

Like a letter?

Perhaps they care more that their rights are being ignored more than the actual personal items found in the locker, though

Nicole?

Haha
