So what's our next topic 

So privacy 

nope, its public information, you put it out there, its gonna get seen

when you put things on the internet you have to assume its going to get seen especailly on things like that 

absolutely

so what did you say? 

what was your consensus donny 

haha

thats good 

also, a lot of employers now a days look you up on the internet

the students can on facebook now 

myspace cant however, you have to be underage for your profile to be private

Im with blue here 

its public information 

thats at ANY private intstitution 

no, its indeed public 
youve put it onto a public domain 

exactly 

there ya go, so then set your data that way 

tehy dont 

we arent saying they break through the security 

its evidence of a persons character 

so absolutly it can be brought up 

like?

k 

the thing is that if you put it there it has the chance of being seen, and you've given up your right to privacy by putting it on the internet 

and youre on there as a Loyola student 

yes but youre representing loyola 

its fair 

because you gave up the right to privacy when putting it public 

how is FB gonna stop that? 

ok lets just talk about the internet as a whole then 

should things you put on the internet be used in trials? 

has anyone read the pillowman

well in the story this author writes stories about murders, and then the murders get committed 

should he be arrested? 

Nope

just a very well read person

right 

but just using the premise 

the he wrote the stories 

the murders are committed 

Do the cops have the right to pull him in ? 

( im a weird person its ok ) 

no the stories were written and published 

and teh murders committed 

do the cops have the right to pull him in 

exactly
Ok im not saying to talk about the book 

Say Someone published stories online, that they wrote 

about murders 

and the murders were committed

he published them on the internet 

we're talking about these things becoming public 

so is there still a connection to the author

a disclaimer saying "if these murders happen i didnt do it

i was being a bit facitious

doesnt come off as well on the internet lol 

but if the murders happened after publication, do the cops have a right to question him 

hm

so likewise 

right

hi niki 

what if its not so blatant 
so what is private then in our day and age 

is anything really private today? 

such as? 

no really 

such as? 

there are in some public bathrooms, as long as there are stalls (theres no camera in the stall) 

have i really added excitment? glad i could help 

whats more important 

safety

or privacy 

personally i think my privacy is very important 

i dont know about that 

id rather be left to my own devices security wise and give me my privacy 

i'll give you that 

id rather have to deal with a lot of my own security, rather than having it done for me 

no
i said a lot 

not all 

misworded my apologies 

that thought terrifys me 

big brother 

::shudder:: 

not private at all 

far to easy to hack

yep 

thats why i dont send things online 

same

we signed a consent form 

not a privacy form 

it means our name wont be connected to our data as such 

yeah, consent form 

yes, its for study purposes its public 

haha yeah 
yes

public

yes 

judge me all you want 

yes. because i signed a form giving that permission 

if i hadnt then absolutly not 

i thought we were extending this to include our identities, sorry

no, but i also feel that its not private because it is online 

still n the internet 

still. online 

correct

except melissa nd nicole 

but if any of us could hack we could trace IP's 

haha shoop 

frankly im not saying anything i dont believe in here, so if anyone knew my name it wouldnt bother me 

Half of me wants to introduce myself at the end of the study (not saying i am) 

im gonna be honest, i know know how i feel about it 

i have nothing to hide either, but i feel like, well shoop just said it 

its a step towards orwell's 1984 

a big on 

e

exactly 

(same with the war or anything else gobig) 

haha 

i think that the public knows very little to none about what goes on in the gov't and we wont know for a very long time 

agreed

but who gets tapped 

and who decides 

and what is viable information 

herein lies the problem 

cause it all comes down to human error 

and emotion and well life 

well no matter how unbiased someone is supposed to be theyre listening and theyre still going to have some bias 

whether its political 

emotional 

territorial what have you 

or what can be brought up in court 

well i dont think they could do that 

i think the avg americcan doesnt even think about it 

they dont care 

but they dont 

agreed, and its scary 

psst 

i think donny is big brother 

check that *ahem

whered ya come up with the name? 

haha 

i wonder why 

wb

ah right 

i thought it looked familiar 

hell im always hungry 

too much work to do 

hahaa
