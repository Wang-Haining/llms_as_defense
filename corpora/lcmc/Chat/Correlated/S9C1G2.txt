yes 

what?

oh i see 

but that's different from gay marriage 

i have a question 

should gay marriage be a national issue, or decided state by state M

as of right now i believe, Vermont and New Jersey allow civil unions 

and Massachusettes allows full marriage 

i don't think there's really much of a difference at all 

if anything, the institution of straight marriage is falling apart 

the divorce rate is over 50% 

in this country 

its okay for marriage under state 

but then it becomes more difficult if you talk about it within the Church 

the people who belong to it 

i think prejudice is even more of an issue in our society 

there used to be laws against marriage between blacks and whites
there's still a lot of prejudice present against that today 

and i think its a similar isuue with gay marriage 

I don't think the Church will ever allow gay marriage, at least, I don't think the Catholic Church will, but i thin, the more important issue is gay marriage in a legal sense 

which is still not allowed throughout most of the country 

that is the view of the Church 

hmm, i think we're all on the same page then about gay marriage under the state 

as do I 

perhaps if the Church was more more open and accepting, there wouldn't be such scandal 

with the sexual abuse of young boys i mean 

well everything about us is a combination of genetics and culture 

We're a product of the interaction between our genes and our environment

well, some try to hide it... but i think we were in agreement that someones doesn't choose to be gay 

no, but I have gay friends 

well, definitely, prejudice is taught 

what's your opinion about children being raised by a gay couple? 

most straight marriages end in divorce anyway 

people talk about protecting the sanctity of marriage when they oppose gay marriage, but to be honest, i don't really see that much sanctity left anyway

the way people treat it these days 

we won't know unless they're allowed to get married 

the point is they should be given the same chance as straight people

what do you mean? 

lol 

wait, what? i'm sorry, what do you mean? 

i agree 

i think its absurd 

i'm glad it wasn't successful 

i don't think that banning gay marriage is something that Bush should be concerned with at the moment 

I think that he has bigger problems 

that he should deal with 

I think one of the big problems with this issue is the legal disadvantages faced by gay couples 

for example, gay people aren't allowed spousal confidentiality during a trial 

and problems arise when trying to adopt children 

good question 

i have no idea, lol 

where there are still arranged marriages and stuff like that

yes

but then again, the interests of some people are against gay marriage

don't really know the statistics 

but ultimately, I don't see much difference from bans against marriage between African Americans and whites, I think prejudice plays a big part in people

people's opposition 

People used to argue that it would be difficult for mulatto children to fit into society 

like people now argue that it will be hard for the children of gay people to fit into society 

i think that just shows that we need to change our society 

oh, i wasn 


ah, sorry 

i wasn't talking about slavery 

just blacks and whites not being allowed to marry 

Gay marriage should be legalized, an amendment banning gay marriage would be a deprivation of their rights 

yes, society needs to change
