Yes

I am not necessarily opposed to it 

Sure, as long as you can regulate those "small amounts" 

I do not know that they have really found worse long-term effects than cigarettes, for example 

I am as well 

but as far as the health effects, they do not seem to be any worse than the already legal alcohol or nicotine 

I think it could provide any extra tax resource for the state, as well as cut down on the black market and thus some crime 

Could not agree more 

I believe the problems with underage use will continue 

Regulation can be achieved 

Not sure of the age 

but there is most likely an age restriction like 18+ 

I think it would make some difference 

not an extreme difference, but some nonetheless 

college and highschool kids do not have to resort to illegal actions, necessarily (depending on the age) to obtain the marijuana 

Agreed, people I know how have used it do not use it as such 

Right

And the use is definitely less than that of cigarettes when you consider something like lung problems 

How so Janada 

The mere economics of it though, it would cost like 20 times that of a cigarette

the demand is less, it will drive use down 

Definitely worse 

...driving that is 

with alcohol 

That's not a drug though 

but do they have easy access? 

you have to go through a pharmacist and are made aware of those affects

Ok, but sleeping pills are not OTC as mtnbike alluded to 

Agreed, for quite some time 

Becuase it has not caused as many problems 

the school does not have to legally cover themselves 

Haha, precisely 

But it has caused problems 

a significant enough number for the school to try to cut the risk 

Precisely

We also do not take a driving course 

its just not the issue at hand 

Yes, but it's not legal now, this is why there is no course 

And the school can not educate on EVERYTHING, it should be the responsible of the user 

there are plenty of people not even interested in trying 

must they sit through this

Why rely on other people all the time

take some responsibility 

Again, it is a legal and relevant problem on campus 

You are missing our point 
Alcohol

And there may even be an insurance issue behind it 

Where is there is someone insuring the college, it may be much cheaper to have us educated to atleast attempt to mitigate the problem 

Where there* 

LIke if you take extra driving courses you can cut down on your car insurance 

But I am only speculating 

Haha, yes, good point 

No clue 

I didn't even hear about it until this study 

Ofcourse, there will always be people to bring up those issues and have a point one way or the other, because how can you really place one single age on all people regardless of gender or body chemistry

Agreed

it would probably go to 21 in this society 

True enough 

Heart disease 

Obesity
Those drugs are a separate issue 

I do not think it is a thrill for as many people as we would think 

I think people smoke it because it provides pleasure and no immediate danger 

And it would be far cheaper than others 

Right

Marijuana is cheaper Janada 

Interesting

Sure

So then, do we all pretty much agree for legalization, or atleast see no strong reason against it? 

Yes, availability, but not forced 

Right, there are some issues regarding how you would even regulate how much one person has 

I think that is pretty impossible 

because you can just go to other stores 

or get someone else to purchase for you 

I just think it really matters if you were to get caught at a party or you were busted, if you had more than you were supposed to, that's when problems would ensure 

ensue 

I think your local convenience store 

perhaps bars would pop up like oxygen bars only for marijuana 

thus making people smoke within their facilities

No, nothing in the news, like I said, I did not even know about this until the study
