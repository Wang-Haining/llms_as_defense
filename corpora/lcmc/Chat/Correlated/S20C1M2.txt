Yup

double yay 

(though, keep in mind i've never smoked) 

Likewise

it's cool man, i have muscles to comfort me 

OKKKKKK 

i think that it should be legalized 

ok, i mean, nobody's name is being used 

has anybody here smoked...nobody say no...just say if you have 

3 

2 

1

ok then, i guess none of us are that experienced, lol 

how about the next one 

who's been around people who're smoking 

i have... 

girls? 

yeah, i agree 

well

i heard that cigs are worse 

pot does have its props though 

like if it's grown, farmers can use it to really help the soil in growing crops 

hey man, it'd help out the US. farmers, and i'm from a farming town...

it adds up if you do it a ot 

it's expensive because it's illegal 

HOWEVER.... 

if it was legalized, do you think the gov't would drop the price since it's legal, or raise it up since so many people would buy it then? 

yeah, so they could tax and regulate it 

yeah

sin tax 

that's why they put taxes on cigs and porn (i learned about it at school)...because they don't want a looooot of people buying it 

who doesn't? 

well just to get a vote thing going, because i like doing it, if it WAS legalized, who would buy it?

i probably would 

yeah

on mom's b-day, the special occasions 

hahaha

that'd be horrible 

i think that it should be legalized all together 

probably the FDA will determine what that limit 

but in reality, there's no way...like no "big brother" to monitor how much you have or smoke 

(1984 reference) 

oh yeahhhhhh

it really does mellow you out 

i mean 

i was with a friend a few weeks ago who did it 

and he was all happy 

yeah, there isn't hallucination going on 

however, salvia is a really powerful hallucinagin that IS legal 

and you smoke it

what?

not that i'm aware

gotcha

lol

probably over the counter? 

that's where salvia is sold...over the counter 

but wait, salvia is actually sold at recher and tape traders i think 

seriously

it's just a drug from what i'm aware of 

iunno if it's legal everywhere, but it's legal in maryland 

well like huffing is illegal isnt' it? like the act of it? 

that's wrong....study high, test high, get high scores 

given in some cases it can be true, as a generality it's not 

http://www.salvia.net/ 

i don't think so 

i don't think tobacco should be regulated by how much you can buy...it's a personal choice, just like i think pot should be legalized and be a personal choice

well, none is healthy 

lol 

smoker riots 

lol

aka half of this country 

yeah

well

if you treat it like alcohol then, if somebody is driving high (i've talked with two stoners with different opinions based off of experiences)....and they get pulled over...should the penalty be the same for driving w/alcohol as opposed to driving w/pot? 

though it is a different type of influence 

i mean 

i know a guy who says that he drives perfectly high, but then i have a friend who could've died by driving on the wrong side of the road high (he's stupid) 

lol

true that 

does anybody think that it's morally wrong to smoke pot? 

(religion again...sorry guys) 

so are you saying that cigs are immoral then? 

with the whole keeping your body pure bit...? 

gotcha

yeah, i think it should be that way for pot 

the gov't can get anything in reality 

hahah surgeon general's warning: you will have a good time

the government CAN get anything drug wise 

yeah, they totally can 

did i word it weird? 

Yeah

Lol

no problemo 

(sorry duuuuuudes) 

i think that economically, it will help

i mean, knock off like half of the black market.... 

the black market is what screws our government over 

i know some people do grow their own tobacco 

i don't see the big deal 

i think that the companies would eventually drop the prices

i don't think that people growing it will matter 

in reality, like look at alcohol 

used to be stricly prohibited 

now they sell kits to do it 

i mean 

i would like to invest in my own eventually quite personally

HAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 

i mean 

what about moonshine 

is that legal or no? 

i know they sell it, but isn't making it illegal? 

yeah....people are too lazy to organized the underground pot society

lol 

i think that the gov't would get money out of it which is why it's good, but i also feel as though the black market will decrease with it, but never entirely 

i feel strongly about that 

totally agreed 

isn't it nice when we all get along??? 

lol 

whatever, they'll just sit on a couch, listen to pink floyd and watch the science of sleep 

(watched it the other day) 

it's a stoner movie, and i actually watched it with my high friend that i was telling you guys about earlier 

didn't we talk about that? 

the whole, we can't do that thing? 

Yeah

C'MON FROGGER! YOU'RE KILLIN ME!

Hahahah

Allllrighty

that'd get it legalized faster too 

woop woop 

it was a pleasure talking with everybody 

thanks Melissa

NO! thank YOU 

(can we leave?) 

ok
