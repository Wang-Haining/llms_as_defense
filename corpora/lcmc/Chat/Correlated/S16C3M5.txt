do you really think anyone would be able to use it with any type of moderation?

but if we were to legalize it all of a sudden

right now it is very expensive and difficult to obtain, and people still experience lifestyle problems because they smoke too much 

imagine if you could buy it at a gas station 

but its more difficult than it would be were it legalized 

yes they do 

dont you think that effect would carry over 

for some people, pot kills motivation because it is so satisfying

exactly only for some 

impossible 

HAHHAAAHA

world of warcraft plus marijuana equals lives ended 

respiratory effects 

but our marijuana prohibition is a moral crusade left over from the early 20th century 

what is that 

i think what the marijuana debate comes down to 

is: is illegality sufficient for immorality 

is everything thats illegal necessarily wrong, does the legislature have the power over YOUR life to make YOUR decisions about morality

we resign that power to them as citizens... but what happens if someone disagrees with the reasoning behind a lwe 

*law 

well in like 20-30 years our college buddies now will be in congress and on capital hill 

then what 

well the government says it is 

immoral 

so my Q was is that sufficient for it actually BEING immoral

i have seen reefer madness 

its a musical? 

LOCOLADY - marijuana is illegal on the grounds that lots of people say it is, including the government 

but deciding for yourself is immoral, as using marijuana is apparently a big problem 
yes but he didnt grow it for shmokin 

he grew it because hemp is a strong/valuable fiber 

according to whom 

according to whom 

the effects of marijuana can be more or less severe than alcohol, depending on the user 

my friend's roomate was so drunk this weekend that he shit on the floor in a carpeted room 

are you high right now 

oh good 

why is that anyways 

i heard it has something to do with metabolism 

stunts your mental development 

so which does everyone think is worse, alcohol or pot 

i think they probably would similarly to alcohol 

people cant even control thmselves now and its illegal 

i think if we were ever going to "legalize", decriminalization would be a much better option 

after all, the prohibition of marijuana is OBSCENELY expensive 

every posession charge is an arrest, ride in a popo car, booking, hearing, probation period, etc, and costs the state TONS of money 

is our moral crusade against pot worth all that? 

how much is that\ 

which is usually very expensive 

an hour per topic?

alright 

how so 

but wouldnt it affect productivity 

are high people as productive as sober ones 

no the coke money goes to columbia, or at least it did in the early 90s 

and panama 

do you think a lot of people do 

heck, even in the U.S., it is only as illegal as people are receptive to the fact that they MIGHT get caught

because our police, who work their ASSES off, can only catch a small percentage of people who actually smoke marijuana 

which leads to another question 

would the billions spent of pot enforcement be better spent on murder, rape, and other violent crimes? 

our police force is stretched thin in spots as it is 

EVERY person caught with weed is arrested, held, booked, released, has to attend multiple hearings, and usually, a supervised probation period 

the state has to pay the cops, the judges, the public defenders, prosecutors, probation officers, correctional officers, etc etc etc 

so should they prioritize elsewhere 

i mean 

many suburban towns have TONS of money kicking around from property taxes

and they hire a huge police force 

which responds to legitimate problems, but also spends a ton of time chasing kids with pot 

down the road, there might be a violent crime going on in an urban area where the police almost ignore pot because they have bigger problems

the police on york road : they obviously care more about crack than underage drinking 

when barfights break out between 19 year olds at 2am, they dont do a thing to the bar owners 
because in baltimore, alcohol control is practically a JOKE in the shadow of schedule 1 drug enforcement (crack, heroine, coke, etc) 

absolutely
