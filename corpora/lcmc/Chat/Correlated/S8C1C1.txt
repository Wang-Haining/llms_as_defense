yeah, funny movie 

i was 

i was raised catholic but my feelings changed over time 

now im agnostic 

i felt that the catholic church was way to restricting on both the individual and the group

the bible tells you not to do all of these things, i guess it wasnt really the catholic church in general but more or less just the idea of an organize religion 

i eat meat on fridays 

i havent been to church since 7th grade or so 

i doubt most people ever really change because of what theyve done

like if you used the lords name in vain, i doubt most people dedicate their lives to changing that one fact 

excactly what GOBIGDONNY said 

they raise charity money that the government would not 

in all honesty now, im not a part of the catholic church, but i feel that it doesnt need to change if it doesnt seek the need to. it's a religion, not some soccer club. though it would be nice to see some changes especially related to the little-boy thing it really is entirely up to them. 

Well

if they have somewhere else to divert their sexual frustrations it would help

its the same reason why you hear so many jokes about jail 

for instance "dont drop the soap" 

because when your locked in there your sexual frustrations develop

and you end up finding other means to satisfy that 

in the priests case, little boys 

no matter how high up on the tier you may be in your religion, you still experience human nature 

am i? 

i didnt realize that 

i never meant that at all 

im talking about human nature 

but sure your right, there are only a couple bad eggs in the pack 

im just kidding 

but there are people who do and thats my point 

some people feel they CANT control those urges, and that's when it gets out of hand 

im not talking about all priests 

i dont see why you arent picking up on that 

thats part of the question 

i understand that, thats what i was trying to say but the other 2 in this room keep accusing me of saying "all priests are boy lovers

which im not saying at all 

hah

aha

ill agree 

ive never got such a sense of hostility

the man

i mean, the catholic church is fine, it's just not my cup of tea. i think it would help if priests could marry it would help with the pedo thing

i wouldnt mind if women could become priests 

but then again 

why would you want to bring people back just for one stipulation
thats like offering them money to practice your religion

sure it gets them there, but for the wrong reason 

thats what i think it should be, rather than just used to get people back to the church 

okay i understand now 

it would be cool to have a female pope 

hahahaha

it has been for hundreds of years 

but being a nun seems like such a less powerful role in the church

nuns are cool though 

i dont understand how in gods eyes one newborn can be less of a servant to him than another 

wouldnt that defeat the point of his love for all people 

a nun baked me a pretzel once 

agreed

that would be sweet 

there is no reason why they should not 

it was a good pretzel though 

we folded the dough and then she put it in the oven for us

hahaha

nuns know the same amount about the bible as priests, right? (amirite?) 

got disconnected 

continue peoples 

hot stuff 

alright

not me, as much as that would be nice to see its not enough to get me back into an organized religion for now 

agreed

priestonpriest.com 

i dont even want to know

thats why they should be allowed to marry 

of course 

i dont see why not 

thats entirely up to the church 
if i had my way, sure the pope could marry 

let him have someone to love him too 

besides the several billion people

 well maybe not billion, how big is the catholic church anyway?

modernization 

with a more tolerant culture developing more people are rejecting the outdated ways 

sure it wouldnt have to change the religion 

just some of the practices that make people turn their back on the church 

and things dont last forever 

if they dont change they could crumble 

and now judaism looks like it may be facing an end soon 

i dont know many jewish people 

it seems like it was so much bigger in the past but it seems to be fading

maybe its not even that, it could just be religion in general with the modernization 

and you also have your extremists like fred phelps
