well i personally am completely for gay marraige, so i would definitely oppose both of these things. where do you guys stand on the issue? 

why were you against if you don't mind my asking? 

and what made you change your mind? 

that's an interesting perspective 

so if it were the choice of the individual would it be different? 

well it's not very likely that everyone would choose to be gay 

but i think if anyone did, we should allow them to 

does anyone know if it's determined whether homosexuality is genetic or not

ok i saw posters for that around campus 

i could see people choosing that, maybe to be different, but i also think it is most likely genetic 

yeah, there were a lot of closet gays back in the day 

so there is a lot of evidence for its being genetic 

yes, i would say so

well maybe we should define marraige first 

is it a legal union or just a union? 

i didn't mean legal implications so much as the necessity of a union being legal for it to be considered marraige 

like can you be married if you are not legally bound to the person?

yes, so if you didn't have the legal certificate, is it marraige? 

so then the government does have a say in marraige 

yeah it should be the same for both 

so if the govt is needed to make a marraige legal, then we need the govt to make a gay marraige legal 

so it's going to be unequel, no matter what, because the catholic church won't endorse it even if the govt does 

well, that would stand only for catholics, it could theoretically be equal in other religions provided the govt agrees 

yes, that is what i mean 

yeah, i think we are all in agreement 

what do you mean by provide the process, goldeneye? 

so they should just let it happen like any other marraige 

there should be no distinction 

do you think there are any non-genetic factors?

or having a homosexual family member? 

well if you had a gay brother, say, would that influence your sexual orientation?

well i dont think it would affect my opinions 

i dont think that would ever work! 

thats terrible too! 

and that there would have to be something wrong with you 

yes

well how would you determine if that person actually had the gay gene or were just faking it? 

ok
