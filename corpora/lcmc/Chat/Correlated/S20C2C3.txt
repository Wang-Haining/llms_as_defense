Nope

that's on the discovery channel 

it's crap 

lol

they found a tomb of some ancient people...so they probaby automatically assumed JESUS! 

Lol

I don't think so 

I mean 

why should a religion change to fit what people want? 

the way i figure it 

people want the church to change because of things that they don't personally agree with 

NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! THE INTERNET HAS GOT LITLESTANEMONE!!!!!

i don't see the point in doing that 

i mean 

a religion wouldn't be a steadfast religion if it changed as times changed
as in constantly 

So if the Church would change, what do you guys think that it would change?

they obviously don't want that, yeah 

well in reality, if people are going away from religion based upon stuff like that, then they don't have enough faith in their own religion anyways 

i figure the church made itself the way it is for specific reasons, and therefore i don't hink that it should change, like having women priests...etc

i figure that they can be nuns and thats good enough 

it's kind of like how guys and girls have different sports? i guess is the best way to explain it 

i realize that 

lol

i'm not saying they'd be bad at being priests

and i'm not putting down on nuns 

church is about giving ones self into service of God and others

well they work their way up "the chain”

yeah

well they don't really make a lot of money, but like housing and stuff is provided for i thought 

(priests) 

but they also make an oath of "joyful service"

i talked with father rossi about that the other day 

well, i attended a talk 

i really have no clue 

btw, i looked it up and it looks like the whole just male priests bit is based upon the 12 apostles 

here, i found this on a website 

"Only a baptized man (vir) receives sacred ordination. The lord jesus chose men (viri) to form the college of the twelve apolstles, and the apolstles did the same when they chose collaborators to succeed them in their ministry. 

The college of bishops, with whom the priests are united in the priesthood, makes the college of the twelve an ever-present and ever-active reality until Christ's return. The Churhc recognizes herself to be bound by this choice made by the Lord Himself. For this reason the ordination of women is not possible.

they just feel like if Christ made the decision of that, then that would probably be the best decision 

well going back to the whole jesus didn't look to far ahead comment, the church believes in divine omnipotence 
(sorry, a little late) 

it depends on which parts of the bible 

which is a problem i'll say 

(frogger, where are yougetting your information? is it just assumed or is it factual?) 

Lol

what does your uncle think? 

if you talk to a priest about it, you should think differently 

especially here at loyola 

how old's your aunt? 

yeah 

any church i have seen would support the person 

and some priests are just jerks....they're all different- they're human

so do you guys think like if they had voting things within the church for priests and nuns that everything would be better? 

i do think that that would help out obviously a LOT 

well the way i'd figure it would be the voting could be for reference reason sfor the guys way up 

i agree with dah 

no, my parents are devout catholics, and they'd totally support that (they're over 50) 

different generation...different views..) 

yeah, we need to remember that changing the church would change it all over the world, not just the U.S....so if priests around the world don't agree with the U.S...tough luck, that's the way it goes... 

for that reason, since the U.S. would be the minority, i don't hink that it should change

we need to keep the majority of the church happy 

can you imagine out much controversy that would create?

lol 

i can't 

lol 

i know 

haha

well Germany would definitely be against it with benny D as pope

people die every day in africa for being christian 

i think if their thoughts are that steadfast, then they won't want to change

i had a priest from africa talk to my church about it 

well...it was kind of depressing 

lol

i know, i was joking 

but look at it that way 

if you're dying for a cause 

would you want the cause not to steady, but changing a lot? 

i sure as hell wouldn't want that 

kew
