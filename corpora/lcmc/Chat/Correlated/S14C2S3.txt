and im done 

why should businesses with women and minorities as heads more easily get money? 

well we probably shouldnt just give out money to whoever we feel sorry for

because then...we wouldnt have any money 

exactly like affirmative action 

how is this "affirmative action for women" leveling the playing field tho? 

so whats the world gonna be like when black women get paid more than men just because of their race/gender, not because of the amount of work they do

aff. action is forcing it 

the other way is time 

eventually, with subsidizing city schools and giving everyone equal opportunities, plus anti-racist teaching, hopefully in future generations racism and gender inequalities will disappear 

but we cant do what were doing now 

i mean it will never die out completely 

but eventually it will helplevel the playing ground 

you keep saying ego, im not sure if thats the right word... 

maybe bias is the word, or gender stereotype 

anyway, there are many reasons that gender discrimination exists, and it shouldnt be the govt's job to fix these by just giving businesses money who give them important jobs 

the govt has screwed up, men have screwed up, feminists have definitely screwed up they havent really done jack 

i mean feminists today have failed and instead of promoting gender equality they tend to project an image that they want to be men, and havent ending up solving anything 

instead, now they are just anti-male 

exactly

i mean, feminists like mary daley believe that the world would be better off if there were just dramatically less men on the planet 

i dont know, ask the feminists 

that is changing though 

lol there are plenty of places for women...like the kitchen, the laundry room, the bedroom.... 

its not our fault our brains are twice the size of yours 

of course the topic we started on was that businesses get more money for employing females 

well then governments role should be to monitor businesses not give them money

lol the govt gives out a lot more money than just for businesses on the verge of bankruptcy 

govt gives out money as incentives when the want businesses to do things

while i agree that subsidies are fine 

well generally the govt offers money as incentive, so if you dont want to do what they want, you just wont get the money 

well thats what i was saying, i believe they should be out of the economic world almost completely 

the govt, that is 

not women 

so were agreed that the government sucks at solving things...

i just have to say 

maybe women would be making more progress in the workplace if they didnt wear such skanky clothes all the time 

haha you better 

thats all i have to say about that
