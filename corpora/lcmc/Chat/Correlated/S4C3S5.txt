after all, it isnt a wise choice for employers to discriminate 

its costly 

If some employer refuses to hire a woman with adequate skills, a competitor can hire her

thus, it is costly 

I think businesses today, for the most part, are most concerned with results 

Its not like they don't have the opportunity 

if she does a good job, yes 

Margaret Thatcher was PM of Great Britain in the 80's 

But if they want to have a good relationship with the most powerful country in the world, they might have to suck it up

example?

 think their professionalism would overcome gender discrimination 

Thats because more men take jobs after high school 

its just coincidental 

its an individual choice whether and wher to attend college 

Some positions are just better suited for men 

Men and women are physically different 

That has nothing to do with strength 

you cant deny that fact 

I'm not following 

I dont think thats pertinent to strength 

No

infantry, at least 

If I'm fighting in a war, I would rather have a man fighting beside me than a woman 

I'm saying for the most part 

But we cant have a draft that puts women in combat positions 

They can operate combat vehicles like aircraft and tanks 

because physical strength is not a factor in those cases 

that would be acceptable 

Israel's a different story 

with a far smaller population than the US, they expect everyone to participate in the military if necessary 

How should we address it? 

Maybe women are just too sensitive
