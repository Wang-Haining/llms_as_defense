Yep

no, that's a load of bs 

yeah. time to re-write the bible again

they don't have to change, but what i mean is that if they intend to survive as a relevant social force, they should change, or else they'll lose that relevance 

yeah, and it's fine if they want to remain the way they are now, but they're going to lose significant portions of their members, and i don't think they want that

haha, salgood

i think their biggest issues involve 1.) birth control, and probably even more importantly 2.) the structure of the church istelf 

me too 

yes, and the hierarchy itself (pope as father of the church) 

yep 

i'm not saying he shouldn't be 

i'm just saying that the structure shouldn't be so insulated; none of the rank and file church members have any say in what goes on in the upper echelons

and this leads to the kind of corruption you saw in the priest scandal 

yeah

the rationale was based upon traditional views of gender roles which are now outmoded 

and the guys sport is the power to change the bread and wine into christ's blood and flesh and minister to the people, whereas the nuns mostly pray in convents 

haha, i was pointing out the disparity between their roles, not commenting on what they do 

yep. which is not the same. at all

yeah. you have to be a man to have a significant decision-making role

i'm not saying they don't contribute at all 

but they don't make any policy-making decisions 

no, but priests have the potential to through promotion

plus, as one nun once pointed out to me, priests make a hell of a lot more money

yep. it's a much more comparable role 

no, they definitely make more money 

i know a lot 

(of priests, i mean

yes, but those are the only roles open to them 

right 
well, an ingrained view of the male in the role of shepherd, more generally

partially, but in the very early church, there were female priests with some comparable powers 

there's some specious documentation of it 

but that changed once it was organized 

true dat 

yeah, they probably would have offed jesus a lot sooner if he'd walked around with a bunch of women as his right-hand people 

me too 

yeah, but that outlines a tradition, not a reason 

that's sophistry though. jesus' gender would have been irrelevant in another context 

yeah. we don't walk everywhere in sandals anymore

well, here's the thing about the no meat on fridays 

that was instituted to help the fishing industry, since a lot of catholics fished 

yeah. and priests not being able to marry was instituted because when they could, the title of priest became heriditary, and they could bequeath church property to their children, which caused financial problems 

yeah, but jesus didn't necessarily have omnipotence in the general sense, b/c he was corporeal 

yeah. and often badly trasnlated 

translated 

12 years of catholic education, not including loyola 

and i have an uncle who's a priest 

haha, shh...don't tell i was criticizing the church 

he's actually very liberal on things like this. he's for women priests and married priests, but he'd been told by the bishop several times to keep his mouth shut in public about

yeah, most of the decision-making goes on in the upper echelons and then is handed down as writ 

well, the views of individual priests vary widely, of course, too

yeah, the problem is more the decision-making structure 

probably. it doesn't seem like a very likely option, though 

and we have to remember that the views of american catholics are very different from those elsewhere in the world in many cases 

well, i don't know that it's true to say that the majority wouldn't want any kind of change. it's not all or nothing 

well, some, but not necessarily all. we have to remember that there's as much potential dissent within countries as here, too 

good to go
