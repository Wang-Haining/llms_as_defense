Yes

I'm for it 

well I'm sure they have some standard and if you're caught with more then the problems arise 

i agree which would either be a good thing, or make people turn to another drug for a bigger thrill 

but at the same time, it doesn't take smoking a lot to get high 

21

i believe 

yeah I don't think there are really any long term affects that are any worse than cigarettes of even alcohol for that matter 

well obviously, you can't be under any controlled substance while driving 

only because its addictive, i don't think the effects are worse 

yeah in fact i think alcohol is even more dangerous than pot 

well i don't think the problems with marijuana could get any worse regardless of legalization 

no they'd just move on to other things 

no i don't think it it 

i dont consider it to be in the same category as heavier drugs 

it's not addictive, you don't build up a tolerance, it won't kill you

at least not immediately 

well that depends 

there are people that i went to high school with that i could probably count on my fingers how many times i saw them not high in all four years 

I think that driving drunk is worse to be honest 

alcohol is pretty much just a worse drug all around 

what's not? 

but marjiuana isn't classified as a depressant is it? 

i feel like it's much easier to got pot than it is to get sleeping pills though 

yeah but there aren't just students who are uner 21 here 

and college isn't known for its drug use, it's known for its alcohol use 

yeah but you are going to turn 21 eventually aren't you? 

no more than high school is 

and also alcohol edu is more about educating you on how to drink responsibly, you can't really educate people on smoking illegal drugs responsibly 

i'd heard about it, but i haven't heard any reactions 
oh definitely 

why 18? 

but i don't think you can have drinking be 21 and not have pot be 21

i'm not saying that i disagree that the drinking age should be 18 

yeah but i don't think that it's going to change back to 18 

so if they legalize marijuana, which i think would happen before the drinking age changed, it will probably be 21 

exactly why alcohol is the worse of the two 

eating how? 

okay that's fair 

okay that's fair 

really i know a lot of people that smoke pot that would never do a worse drug

well, not cheaper than like crack 

but that'll just kill you anways 

crack is like five dollars 

well in response to what you said klutzo, it doesn't sound any worse than alcohol 


i never thought that there weren't any 
oh okay 

yeah pretty much 

there are worse drugs out there that are legal, etc 

well i think that's inevtible 

well it would probably be something like going to the liqueor store 

or like hookah bars 

and i'm sure they will 

and we haven't heard of denver having any problems thus far
