Yep

well most churches probably wouldn't agree to it anyways 

really, that's interesting 

well it's hard to change centuries of thinking, especially if it's condmended in the Bible 

state by state 

as does MA 

the Bible 

that is the problem 

it says homosexuality is a sin condemed by death 

basically, you're going to hell if you're gay 

and it also says marraige is a union between man and woman

according to the Bible yes, I mean I am religious and I"m not saying I'm against homosexuality, but if you're going about it on BIblical terms and why it's such a huge issue in society then yes 

well technically, you're condemned to hell for any sin, but we aren't really here to talk about salvation and repentence, etc 

yeah but you have to ask for forgiveness 

you can 

i didn't say you couldn't 

well you can't ask for forgiveness then keep doing what you're doing i guess i mean maybe you can be gay and not act on those feelings and therefore you wouldn't be sinning 

I do too 

Yeah

that's an interesting way of looking at it 

well i know a lot of churches do a sort of "gay therapy" trying to turn people straight, which i'm not sure i agree with 

well the little boy scandal is a scandal because they were little boys...

nature vs nurture 

but at the same time you weren't born thinking homosexuality was okay, that's a product of the way you were raised and maybe having gay friends, so at the same time some people were raised to think it's wrong 

well just how being raised by only your mom, you don't have a father figure in your life 

if you're raised by two moms it's kind of the same thing 

well going back to the divorce comment, there are a lot of couples that just live together for years and as soon as they get married it ends in divorce, could the same be possible for a gay couple? 

why is that? 

you can't predict the future 

maybe there is just something about the perception of marriage that's gone ary

haha thanks 

but yeah what i said relates to rocket ship's comment 

i think people just have false expectations of marriage 

i agree, love is a choice not a feeling 

well yeah love is a feeling, but ultimately you choose whether or not that is going to be the person you are going to love and spend your life with 

i think that would just end in chaos 

yeah and the gov't doesn't really have any valid reasons to ban it besides religious ones 

that's true 

simplify things how? 

europe is more open about everything though

oh i don't think gay marriage is even a possibility in places like that 

yeah

which is why the state should choose whether or not to legalize it and not the national gov't
