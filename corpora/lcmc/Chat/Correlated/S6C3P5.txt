if you have your profile set to private, than yes. otherwise, it's in a public forum

right, but there's no way to prevent people from looking at the profiles

yeah, but at the same time, people are posting their lives on-line 

if that's what you're doing, that's the risk you run 

not many listen, though 

how do you mean? 

yeah, if they wanted to just cruise facebook for a while, half the school would be going in for judiciary hearings 

yep, and they don't have the resources, anyway 

yeah, he stands to make a lot of money off facebook 

someone offered him an exorbitant sum for ownership of the site (i forget what the figure was) and he turned it down 

haha 

right, public officials have the right to act on information they have legitimate, legal access to 

well, it is mostly a waste of time, since they rarely act on it 

he was pretty dumb 

if you're planning something you don't want other people to know about, don't post it in a public forum 

yeah, nothing on the internet is really private, in the sense of being secure

yeah 

yeah, it's not like they hacked in 

yeah...it's still a really creepy place, though 

yeah...facebook looks nicer, at least 

indeed

i don't know that there are any laws related to the internet activity of convicted peds yet 

yeah, they're already on a lot of lists 

that's fair 

that's true too

same here 

not really 

yeah.

privacy is good. indeed 

also true. i think the courts are going to be fighting that one out for the next several years 

in some places 

yeah

or the administrators have access to all the locker combinations

yeah, you're risking your privacy if you're going to behave stupidly

haha, right 

tru dat
