i think there are already more than enough troops 

they don't really seem to be getting anything accomplished 

me too 

i think there's a problem with our government if it keeps doing things that its people do not support, and only the president does 

but not anymore 

could you explain that clockwatcher? 

i dont thind WMD are ever a good idea 

Well, we could have been operating under the idea that the removal might not have happened

that's true 

How do you guys feel about our continued presence there? 

by finish it, would that include sending more troops? 

i think by staying too long it could also get worse than if we just pull out

but it's hard to tell when one option becomes worse than the other 

I think we need to determine SOME goals. 

The main problem I have with the war is that the goals are not clear. 

that's an interesting take on it 
probably true 

well maybe we haven't seen them yet? 

probably 

but a lot of places don't have democracy and we don't go imposing democracy everywhere, so why here? there must be another reason for our presence there 

which we were saying is economic 

oil 

no necessarily 

thats OK 

not really 

i think we will eventually control them in a way, like imperialism 

but i'd never thought about that much either 

i'm not really very informed on this 

well i think the problem is we don't exactly know why we got in 


it is hard to make an informed decision with all the info
