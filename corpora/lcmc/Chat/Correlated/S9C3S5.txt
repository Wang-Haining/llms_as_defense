it being gender discrimination against women? 

no, the question was gender discrimination 

thanks, just checking 

I feel that it's still very prevalent as well 

well, it's better than it used to be certainly 

it's against the law for them to discriminate 

there are still certain fields where women are not in many top management positions, fields where it is difficult for women to advance 

my dad works in the engineering field 

and he always comments about the lack of women 

in high level positions 

you see it most blatantly in the govenment, the lack of women in positions of power

only the second one in our 230 year history 

you seem so sure of that 

exactly, and people aren't voting for women 

what do you mean? 

what about them? 
yes, I thought we were talking about the United States 

Women in the government face disrespect even from members of the U.S. government 

Within the past ten years, according to my AP government text book, male senators would belittle female senators, and not address them by their appropriate title 

during sessions of Congress, or hearings and things like that 

no, transcripts of tapes of Congressional hearings 

nope

but as long as there's one, that's still a problem 

and we need to acknowledge that there's still a problem 

of course 

there's gender discrimination against boys in the education system

I mean, look at college campuses today, the majority is almost always female

Time magazine reported in an article about elementary education that teachers were showing more attention to girls and their needs rather than the boys 

in a way overcompensating for the discrimination against women that used to be the standard 

that's discrimination against women 
because perhaps there is pressure not to 

I'm just suggesting that perhaps certain general attitudes towards men or women may be a factor in the disarity between the number of males and females that attend college, it's just a thought 

disparity*, excuse me 

um, how exactly has that been proven? 

yup, women are biologically stronger 

nope, i've never heard of those studies 

yup

can you support another life? 

for nine months? 

not all women, not all men 

stereotype

i would beg to differ 

i'm not, i'm just saying that they're biologically stronger 

you can't deny that fact 

their ability to support life 

yes, the study of life, living organisms and vital processes 
women have babies, men don't, that's all i'm saying 

i don't think I completely understand what you mean 

when you say pure biological strength 

oh i'm sorry, that is not what I meant, I just meant it's a big part of it, more vital to life than physical strength 

i have a question 

is it gender discrimination to exclude women from military drafts? 

may i ask why? 

i know women who are stronger than men 

i'm saying what about those women who are stronger 

question, are womne allowed to participate in combat?

women* excuse me 

ah, so what if we had a draft that didn't place women in combat positions 

i see, so what do you think of the Israeli army 

made up of both women and men 

how so? 

i see 


By the way, just thought I'd mention that the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission received 23, 247 charges of sex-based discrimination in 2006 

gender discrimination = problem that still needs addressing 

sure it's possible 

2005 - 23,094, 2004 - 24, 249, 2003 - 24,362, 2002 - 25,536, 2001 - 25,140, 2000 - 25, 194, 1999 - 23, 907, 1998 - 24,454, 1997 - 24,728 Apr

no, it only goes back to 1992

which is, 21, 796 

it's a long process 

well, i think that there's discrimination against both men and women

wait, i'm sorry, what are you talking about? 

okay, and what about that? 

wait, so you're saying that gender discrimination wouldn't bother me unless I'm directly affected by it? 

I'm sorry, I still don't understand your point about the middle eastern mentality 

exactly, if someone discriminates against women, it wouldn' t bother me unless they discriminated agains me personally 

what?
yes i would 

what do you mean? 

i'm not saying i would let it impede my progress 

i'm just saying that I care about discriminatory views 

well, he must hold power over someone 

excuse me, might

so, you're saying that middle eastern men don't treat women equally 

and that you don't care about that 

I'm sorry, I'm just trying to fully understand your point 

I see, and if they have a power position over someone else, and they abuse it, would you feel the need to care? 

ok, thank you for clarifying 

yes

yes
