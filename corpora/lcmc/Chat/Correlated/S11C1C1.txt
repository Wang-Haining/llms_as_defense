No

me either 

i think they should let priests marry 

really?

yes i am catholic 

so what do you think now?

haha what a good facilitator 

i go to the churc when i can..sometimes i feel like the catholic church makes everything too public 

i think your relationship with god is between you and god 

sure 

i mean i hate that you are supposed to go to confession..if you are sorry, can;t you just tell god yourself? 

If you are sorry and you decide to change, why isnt that enough? 

you really believe that? 

i dont mean dedicating your life to that..but who would go to confession just to confess that? 

i agree 
don't you think priests should be able to marry? 

they counsel couples who are engaged or already married, but how can they relate if they don't have that experience themselves? 

Seriously

wasn't this supposed to be a discussion about the church? not priests sexuality?

i really have nothing to contribute to this conversation 

do you think women should be able to be priests

there would be more of a chance they could relate to at least someone or something 

no its understanding the needs of people today and adjusting to that 

i agree 

it wouldnt be something that would just bring people back..but it would make the church a more accepting place 

thats all i mean 

sure why not? 

im not saying it will, but it needs to

then that isnt fair 

i think nuns have a good amount of influence now 
sure why not? 

i think nuns should be able to say mass...the nuns i know have more relateable things to say than most of the priests i know 

haha ok

what??? 

absoluteely not 

if anything i think theyd make it more human and real 

haha

would preists be able to marry nuns?

scandalous 

ill say 

could the pope marry

im not sure how that would work 

but why not? 

its true..thats why they need to make a change 

but thats what makes it such a worldwide religion..it has lasted so long 

really?
good point 

yay!
