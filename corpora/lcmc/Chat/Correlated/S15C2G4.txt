i am ready to be happy too 

sorry, bad pun on gay 

haha

well....all i can say is that they are very old fashion

and if they have a prob with gays, marring, have them call it someting different.....just to make them feel better 

jesus didnt do anyting 

haha thanks 

well if u think about it 

we are the new generation 

ike our parents are prob still not too cool with the idea 

and i mean, it prob isn't , but who am i to say what people can and cant do 

i am not going to go up to some of my friends and be like

ur a freak...cause i dont see them that way 

like we all agreed on b/f....the govt is not too good at solving prob or being open minded 

this is true the govt is (are?) people 

haha totally 

so perhaps the "marriage" should be called something diff, so that those who feel it is wrong wont get offended

 tru 

so again....white males being white males 

true

but they are deff not the same

b/c they are gay 

no, i mean 

like they are more open minded, and the other white males have just not opened up to the idea.... 

I agree with sun beauty!!!!! 

b/c i mean 

just b/c the name is diff 

does not make the union diff 

well, look at this way

when a man becomes a man in the jewish tradition 

it is not called confirmation 

it is not called confirmation 

bamitzfa* (sp?) 

ok, so what i am trying to say is that the names are diff but the idea is the same, and it is all universally accepted 

why not? 

so call it someting then a civil union, and a marraige 

b/c obv some people are not going to let that happen, in calling it a marragie, b/c of thier religious views....so if it has a diff name they would be more likelly to accpet ti 

it shouldnt but they do 

and then if u look at it....they are also seperate 

a marraig is what the church calles it 

a civil union is what the govt calls it 

two names....but same thing 

exactly!!!!! people dont have to get married in a church...so if people called it something different, then it is more likely to be acepted, also...some churchas are going to say no, b/c they dont view it as a marraige....but if the name is diff perhaps they will allow a religious ceremony if that is what teh couple wishes 

thats so sad 
who said they runin the sacredness of marriage? 

b/c if u think that is what i said...i diff did not 

or did not mean for it to come accross that way 

president and pals? 

it is not just them 

it is other people too other then just the republicans 

yeah i know....but i am just saying, it is not only them 

haha yeah so basically if ur republican u have a long nose from lying too much, and if ur a democrat u are just an @$$ 

thats not keeping church and state very seperated 

right...back to being happy 

wow.....now i am really lost 

u are all joking right? 

i was goig to say.....lingindeadbead87, u are one of the most flaming liberals i have ever met....u are deff telling a fib 

no?

moderate then 

haha.....i am not a fan of either one 

ok....i feel as if we are going to get yelled at again 

back to the gay thing 

lol 

haha ur welcom 

do tell 

yes i think so 

but i dont know if it is honored when they go back home 

i could be wrong 

oh. yeah that sounds rightr 

haha

well in a way it is 

b/c when ur married u get the benifits 

yeah i agree 

like i know if/when i get married...i would still rather be married and not have the benifits then have the benifits 

aww 

thtst so sad 

thats horrid 

yeah

aww, thats so sad 

tech, he is not her guardian then....b/c she is over 21 right? or is he still her gardian? 

either way, the courst/part of the govt, allowed it to happen

so wait...what was the eventual outcome....the father got the custody?

like is it still going on, or is that the outcome 

eww...i have no idea 

hahaha

i think we set the record for getting off topic 

sorry

ahhhh we are soooo close
