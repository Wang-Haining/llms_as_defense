I believe anyone has the right to see those things since they are put on the net, not under any sort of privacy 

using the information is a different issue 

By the very language of my answer, it's a different issue...reading and using are two different verbs, and thus two different issues 

Exactly

in the case of shootings, yea use it...in the case of a campus party or something 

seems like they are not really using the information for a just cause

I feel so 

when people's lives are in danger, yes 

which would be like shooting information 

no, not necessarily 

without moderation maybe 

Food can endanger your life under your argument 

but there is a thing called moderation 

drinking isnt illegal 

we are not making that distinction 

people can be in college, of age, and drink 
At the same time, are those pictures necessarily incriminating evidence 

How so 

No, my question is how is that incriminating evidence 

a picture...what does it prove without a doubt?

True, I am not arguing that 

it can have water in it 

you dont have to be drinking it

While it is likely you were drinking it

it does not prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt 

why take a picture with your face in those wooden sets at theme parks...are you really a space cadet? 

Sure

Sure they can make an educated guess that you were drinking 

but it is not perfect evidence 

That is the question at hand 

and my personal feeling it yes when lives are in danger, but do they really have a right to step in on lesser matters as well...they are not law enforcement team of the country 
Can schools, beyond their educating duties, be cops as well 

do we have room in the budget for that as well 

Right

out of their jurisdiction 

perfect point Janada 

Perhaps

does not make sense to me at all 

You just made the argument though, Klutzo, that it is a worth-while cause for people doing drugs or alcohol 

Yea, regardless of the information medium 

I do too 

I think the distinction is that you use those websites with the knowledge that they are public, you approach a phone infromation transmission as private, and it should be treate as such 

I thought your argument was that they schools should be able to go after the people if it was for stuff like alcohol as well as shootings 

But you say no to that use of information if the medium is a phone 

Also I believe the internet can be set up to be used privately

those sites, however, clearly were not 

But if they came across that information, not use it? 

Yes

True

but to catch the e-mail in transmission is a different story 

without the knowledge of either sender or recipient 

Sure can 

It would be a different story Janada because neither the recipient nor the sender gave permission to read the e-mail

it was captured in transmission 

as to Klutzo, I am not entirely sure, those kids do have a right to free speech, but since the information is made public, maybe just make that kid and her parents aware it is there, but as a school, I do not think they should take any action beyond that 

Right again, I think you have to look at this from situation to situation with the main factors being relevance of information to the school or whatever establishment is evaluating the information, see if that information is under your jurisdiction, but when it comes to human safety, that should be an issue for all - does anyone else think they have any sort of generalizations on the topic yet 

Im not sure I understand how they could give them detention 

I do not agree with that 

I think the school can only control students within their jurisdiction within school property or school sanctioned trip off of property 

Detention was not right 

they did nothing wrong at school 

Sure

Interesting, first off though, I think those sites should be blocked

At school

Does not really seem to be his right to do so 

Sorry

Yes, that is not his job 

Not all websites 

Yes

You can block those sorts of things, downloads and access

I am with Janada in the fac that a simply, sophisticated upfront job on the IT side of things could have mitigated all of these problems 

AIM express 

True

you can always find ways to deviate from the education 

They should 

Yes

They can do all they want, but it takes the will of the student for any of it to work 

They can cut distractions to aide in that, but it is still ultimately up to the student 

Yes

That's an example of the educators promoting education to the students

If that's your choice, yes 

What's your point 

I've lost your point here 

My school did not have rules against me walking the halls for 50 minutes during my free periods 

No he's saying just because there are rules does not mean you cant do it 

You get caught, those are the consequences 

Right

but it is up to the student whether or not to adhere 
just having rules does not guarentee everyone will follow 

Alright, so what is the issue here 

I know, I was just asking in general 

Alright, I agree with that 

best way to mitigate it to block that stuff upfront 

My final thought, as we discussed, is that there must be some jurisdiction set to the establishment under which internet or other infromation is used. The information should be pertinent and relevant to that establishment and free speech must not be forgotten. Additionally, problems can be mitigated if schools and the like just understand the technology, block the technology, and not even allow for temptation 

Yes
