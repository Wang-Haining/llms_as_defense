none of us here have a REALLY adequate idea of whats going on ober there 

because we havent been there... 

and by the time it filters through the newspapers and news shows, its in this "digested" form which just wants us to get angry about it 

after the cold war we stopped putting as much energy into "human assets"

which was a big problem going in, we had nobody to really trust 

definitely

a homeland war is a scary idea no? 

but seriously tho 

do you guys think its easy to take three groups who HATE each other and make them agree? 

do you think the red sox and yankees would ever skip around the bases together singing happy love songs? 

what if the two friends HATE each other with a vengeance

and are willing to kill for it 

well maybe not never but they havent for hundreds of years 

superior firepower is an excellent last defense but it can't always solve political problems 

nobody it was an "international action" enforced by a "coalition of the willing"

THEY are at war and we are standing around trying to say WOAH EVERYBODY CALM THE HELL DOWN NOW 

i DEFINITELY believe that saddam hussein's ba'ath party rule was not a good system of government... but now its gone, we have inherited some serious problems that beg the question whether or not intervention was justified 

yes we have blue, the removal of saddam and the emergence of deep seated conflict which we failed to wholly forsee 

by the sword it was stable 

and those who didnt agree were pretty much any non-sunnis 

you are right, it was group A killing groups B and C 

3,000+ 

3+

and between 60,000 and 66,000 civilians killed, though DEFINITELY not all from our actions 

and the DoD has confirmed over 3200 american deaths 

nothing compared to vietnam, but thats no reason to stay haha

heh

the iraq war passed WTC in casualties last month 
possibly fall? is it even elevated to legitimacy now? 

well the middle east is large and complicated 

HUNDREDS and HUNDREDS of years of history of conflict WITHIN iraq, between isreal and palestine, etc 

as an american, if the canadian army killed my entire family in crossfire, i would be PISSED 

i have friends at loyola who are from serbia who live here and love america and love the life they have in this country, but they HATED america when we attacked them 

i dunno... do you guys kind of get what im saying? the sunnis and shiites and kurds arent just gonna get hammered one night and reach an agreement 

well the like us cuz we got rid of saddam 

and they like us because we are TRYING to rebuild their lives, but TONS of them don't have electricity yet, they still have to pass through pain in the ass checkpoints, and dont like us for that 

would guess most of their aggression is aimed toward each other rather than us, there are just groups who dislike/attack us 

at this point our best realistic goal is to find the BEST course of action which is realistically possible which will lead to the least amt. of suffering for us AND them 

if i could do ANYTHING i would learn arabic, get a lot tanner, go to iraq, and make friends and just talk to them and see whats up 
there is a way to compromise 

but as newcomers to the region, how do we unravel 800+ years of bad blood adn find it 

but we arent tearing their homes apart

their internal conflicts are tearing each others homes apart, and we have secondary/tertiary roles in them 

an iraqi whose family was killed in the gas attacks will love us for hanging saddam

errr not hanging but removing and bringing to quasijustice

but one who has to commute to baghdad for work every day and wait in a 3+hour checkpoint line will be frustrated 

and MANY MORE, whose families have been killed by other iraqis, will just get pissed and feed into their downward spiral of a civil war

thats where the hate will come in 

i think at this point we have the BEST intentions in iraq (set up a govt, economic infrastructure, etc) but they just might not be entirely feasible considering the fact that we are BROKE AS SHIT 

nobody knows 

discourse is often the best way to any decision 

thats one metaphor 
heres another one

if you fill a nalgene bottle with water, motor oil, and rocks, it will separate into layers 

and NO MATTER HO WHARD you shake it it will always separate into layers

NO MATTER HOW HARD you try to smush all the iraqis into a coherent nation they will (At least on the forseeable future) ALWAYS want to separate, there is simply TOO MUCH bad blood 

not because they are different, because they have 800+ years of violent hateful history 

different people dont necessarily have to hate each other tho

yes shoop 

but "hey you killed my mom you fucker, i will never forgive you OR your religious sect which hates mine”

well right now that one person has to compete with muqtada al-sadr etc etc etc 

because he is one person who is inspiring many more 

in a violent direction 

they probably just want to live in a place where they can have electricity and water and not worry that each day might be their last 

YES IT IS 

and it is a SHITLOAD more complicated than ANY news outlet will EVER give it credit for 

they aim for digestability and easy watching 

they do NOT aim to give us accurate/intellectually stimulating information about this 

even if not yellow journalism, it's MARKETABLE journalism 

they dont give a shit about our awareness, they give a shit about their demographic staying tuned 

so the only place we will ever be able to figure out whats going on are by TALKING to vets who have come back or reading REAL publications like foreign affairs magazine 

for their demographic 

if fox news wants the conservatives to watch they will talk about what the conservative administration is doing right in iraq 

if some other outlet wants the "liberals" it will be different

british broadcasting company 

err corporation 

or something 

international sources are always better 

newspapers in spanish are interesting too 

wellll 

its not necessarily that they care and we dont, its just that in general, the international reader is more sophisticated and aware 

they have to care, the typical american is like YAAAAY GREYS ANATOMY and HOLY SHIT ANNA NICOLE SMITH DIED IM SOOOOO SAD\

exactly

seriously

WHO SHOULD REALLY BE GIVING A SHIT ABOUT THOSE THINGS!!

people who dont want to think about death and destruction on the other side of the world care more about britneys head than that nick kid from west chesters head that got cut off 

need to be but wont be because they are too apathetic 

john locke totally called us out on that 200+ years ago by the way

he said that once we all had enough to be comfortable materially we would all become "individualistic" and stop caring 

he called it the bad side of "american individualism

the tendency to say "well i have my car and house and shit so WHO CARES ABOUT IRAQ or WHO CARES ABOUT VOTING" 

and check it out he was right 

yes yes yes 

but thats not static, something catastrophic could happen and it could change! 

eg 1929!

well he was talking about americans 

and his predicitons were pretty eerily dead on 

but that made us temporarily care 

that made us care enough to go into afghanistan 

and some people definitely MANIPULATED our 9/11 feelings to make us go into iraq too even tho the two were unrelated 

but do you know why we didnt find osama 

because when we went into afghanistan we had no reliable human assets, so we paid a bunch of warlords to secure the borer on the side of the country which we weren't invading from, they then took our money and let saddam sneak out the other side 

err osama 

not saddam 

and now hes gone 

AND hes a BUILDER for christ sakes 

but he has, with all his WELL BUILT foxholes and shit 

which we will never be able to totally flush out because its a logistical nightmare 

i dont know and i dont care 

because even if he is he cant really do much now 

because OSAMA is inconsequential, as soon as we get him, someone else will take his place 

we need to be trying to resolve the CONFLICT, not just resolving the MAN

did killing saddam pacify iraq? 

will killing osama pacify the world? 

Xacto

haha i thought we were talking a half hour on each topic 

oh word 

yes we did 

we didnt go into iraq for osama 

BUT if it werent for 9/11 it would have been a hell of a lot harder to sell the american polis/congress on invading iraq 

people were still scared about being attacked, and the WMD thing played into post 9/11 fears seamlessly 

saddam would still be a egomaniacal fruitcake in power there

if we didnt go in there 

he wouldnt really be doing a whole lot 

hed be talking a lot of shit 

and maybe trying to score som uranium from ahmadinejad 

but mahmoud would be like i aint touchin you homie 

look at it this way: we are now broke, bankrupt, we owe our SOULS in T-bills to china, and we are still sending reckless threats to iran 

saddam was so delusional that he SERIOUSLY didnt think we were gonna make it into baghdad 

he buried his jets in the sand for christ sakes cuz he thought he was gonna have to suppress a rebellion in the south after he WON the war 

thats quite a generalization, its a big bag of something but i dont know if its a big bag of i hate america 

its a big bag of "hey we can play this game too, so give us legitimacy and stop treating us in a condescending manner you behemoth of an america"

if bush wasnt too freaking proud to sit down at a table with mahmoud ahmadinejad (iranian prez) we might get somewhere 
pull out of iraq? 

i dont think i am sufficiently informed to suggest a pullout strategy 

and after reading papers/watching TV, its possible that none of us are, no offense guys, everyone in this room seems WICKED smart 

what peace?

hey speaking of nuns and pretzels 

we all just sort of prayed and it fell out of a tree 

okay so back to the topic hahahahahahaha my bad 

how much more time do we have 

7 minutes? 

JINX

otay 

WORD

heyy partisan conflict is nothing but commercio-political BULLSHIT that keeps everyone running in circles while congress makes all the real decisions in back room coalition-building meetings 

 for instance 

gay marriage? 
who gives a fuck, really 

abortion debate? 

that just keeps all the religious peopel from realizing that if they ACTUALLY lived out their religious beliefs in a political way, theyd be protesting the iraq war right now 

politically brilliant isn tit

haha

and another thing 

how can someone be anti-abortion yet pro-death penalty and pro-iraq at the same tim 

it seems to be logically contradictory to me, explain 

but babies are full of original sin right 

ill shut up now blue 

well no 

obviously the criminals have no dignity or value as human beings

but the fetus is full of original sin right? 

sin is bad 

criminals are full of sin too right 
so they deserve to die because: blue322: they committed a crim

but some people deserve to die for it 

this is so mean 

i feel like we are ganging up on blue 

WORD
