With regard to the war, I do not feel strongly one way or the other as to whether or not the United States is “doing the right thing.” Most of this is a result of my lack of exposure to media coverage of the war; though from what I have witnessed and observed, I am more inclined to think that remaining in Iraq is not in America’s best interests. It seems as though we entered for the wrong reasons (i.e. were not completely justified in our action). Given the terrorist attacks of September eleventh, some say that the administration was in a “better position” to launch out on the war on terror, given the atmosphere of fear. Despite greater initial approval and support from the American public, this fervor has since waned dramatically. Plus, it is necessary to account for the feasibility of any given plan for further occupation or for that matter, a gradual pullout. Some individuals claim that American troops are remaining within Iraq for the sole purpose of saving face and maintaining a sense of “national image” abroad. So, should we stay or should we go? A permanent stay does not seem likely, especially given the growing level of dissension among the American population. Moreover, the citizens of Iraq oppose the occupancy. Some individuals have referred to American actions as modern-day colonialism. It seems as though we would eventually reach a bottleneck, and be forced out, given growing pressures both at home and abroad. In a word, it may be likened to a sort of international “pop!” Beyond the tacky metaphor, however, it seems as though a sudden withdrawal would not be tenable either. The most logical route then, seems to pull out slowly and gradually over an extended period of time. The question remains then. “Can peace be achieved?” I do not have the answer to that question, nor am I sure if that anyone does.
