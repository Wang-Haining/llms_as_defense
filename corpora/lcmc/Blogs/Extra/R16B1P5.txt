If you know how easy it is to get a fake state ID as a college kid, then you must realize it is just as easy, if not easier, for a terrorist in the US to get one. There are even plenty of websites devoted to making fake IDs and mailing them out to their customers. If a national ID system were instituted, there would have to be some new state-of-the-art security system involved – otherwise, I don’t see why fake national IDs would be any harder to obtain than state ones. People will usually find ways around any security measures if given enough time. All I’m saying is that if the government decides to do this, they better get it right.
            Patient confidentiality should not be compromised. In the case of a person with HIV not telling their sexual partner, I think the other person involved is the only one to blame. People with HIV are not going to walk around with signs saying, “I AM HIV POSITIVE”. It should be the responsibility of the individual to find out if their partner has HIV. Every individual should at least find out more about the trustworthiness of a person before having sex with them. Since this is a big reason HIV runs so rampant in the world, it seems that people with HIV should be prevented from having sex completely, unless it is with another HIV positive partner. But since we cannot stop such a thing from happening, and since releasing medical information would be a huge violation of people’s privacy, it must be taken upon the individual to be smart about whom they have sex with. However, if someone is to find himself HIV positive and has an idea of who caused it, they should be able to bring the person who caused it to trial, but only if the person was aware of their condition beforehand from prior HIV testing. Though something like this would seem reasonable, it would end up achieving nothing in the end except maybe giving the prosecutor some money and/or sending someone to jail for not saying they had HIV.
