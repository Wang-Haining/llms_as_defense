While I personally have a hard time thinking of marriage in a way that doesn’t involve a man and a woman for myself, I am in full support of gay marriages.  If two people are committing to each other for a lifetime, then why shouldn’t the state and church allow that, regardless of sex.  Although these people are not able to procreate between each other, there are alternate ways of having a healthy environment to raise children.  There are children worldwide looking for homes that they can live in as apposed to living in poverty in their countries or being tossed between foster homes in the Unites States.  I personally know a gay couple that has raised 3 wonderful children who are extremely well behaved, intelligent, and gentle kids.  It made no difference to these children whether they had two fathers or a mother and a father, because they were raised well and loved their own parents.  In a society that has couples being divorced at over a 50% rate, who is to say that gay couples homes would be hard on a child.  Some families have two father and two mothers and many other combinations now. Legally, I don’t believe it is fair to keep those rights of homosexuals to get married from them.  Homosexual relationships have all the same types of emotions and trials and tribulations that standard couples endure.  There is no reason that they can’t be presented as a joined pair before God and our country in the same way that everyone else is.  They are not infringing on any one else’s rights or causing any governmental tension.  The only people who seem offended by this idea are the people who are not ready to accept homosexuals into our society completely at all let alone allow them to wed each other.  As the United States made tremendous strides in the rights as women and minorities I think it is also time for the gay community to gain some of the simple privileges they have requested, namely matrimony.
