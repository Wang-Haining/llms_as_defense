In terms of cultural perception, gender discrimination remains apparent in modern American society. Some cite that males and females have differing brain chemistries and physiologies, which predispose them to be more apt at certain tasks. These claims are, to a fair extent, sound. However, they become damaging when carried too far. If a company overlooks a man’s qualifications for the mere sake of registering another female employee, that does not make sense. The same holds true in reverse. Negatively discriminating upon the basis of gender has existed for centuries, and despite any cultural claims of greater “open-mindedness,” it seems as though this is not something we can eradicate fully. There still exists a substantial wage gap in several career fields, and there are jobs that are dominated by one sex over the other. Compared to men, women have a much stronger presence in the education field. In this example, I am not saying that it is “bad,” or that men are being pushed to the wayside. The problem arises when individuals incorporate these general “trends” into their perceptions governing the entire gender group. There is no problem with women teachers outnumbering men; however, the problem occurs if people begin to think that men are lacking when compared to women who teach. The demands of the occupation do not seem to have a relevance to gender. Some would say that women are “better caregivers,” but that does not (and should not) imply that men are incapable of sensitivity.
Another example of gender based discrimination is the notion that women are more inclined to emotion, whereas men turn to reason and logic. An outgrowth of this thought is the separate notion that women are poor at mathematics, especially when compared to men. From my experience, this is not true by any stretch of the imagination. There may be a problem; however, if we allow ourselves to become complacent and merely accept these ideas without question.
