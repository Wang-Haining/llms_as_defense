I admittedly have never been an active supporter of the War in Iraq.  Possibly because when it started I was slightly less informed, but I have always had the feeling that there were intentions hidden from the public.  Now, as I see the approval ratings for President Bush go down, along with the overall support for the war, I wonder if I had the right idea from the beginning.
 
While I don’t think that the United States is currently in Iraq taking the oil from them, I feel that there is some part of this war that involves oil, whether it be long term or just when the war ends.  I have watched the prices drastically change in recent years (most notably after hurricane Katrina), and wondered and often assumed the connection with the war.  As the government begins to realize the increasing need for oil as its supply dwindles, every place seems frantic to find a supply great enough for their country.
 
As for fighting terrorists there has been some excellent work done in Iraq.  Ending Saddam Hussein’s reign was a great stride in finding a Terror free world.  Finding and delivering him to the people of Iraq for hid punishment was an effective way of making strides.  But we cannot forget the many other leaders of Terrorist groups that still remain at large.   As time goes on it seems that more of our men and women are fighting for a cause that is unclear and quickly becoming non existent.  
 
Though it may be true that the general media is emphasizing mainly the negative aspects of the war, we would all like to know the good aspects and things that are being accomplished.  While I don’t believe that we are doing no good in Iraq, I do think we are being kept in the dark on a lot of things that are good.  Often when President Bush and top officials say that they are accomplishing positive things also, they stop there, besides general statements such as “fighting terror.”
