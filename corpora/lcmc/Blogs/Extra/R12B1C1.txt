The Church provides us with some semblance of structure that better allows us to engage the world, while also “living our faith.”
It has become rather easy to lose sight of the goal of religion, and instead get caught up in a whirlwind of Church politics and controversy. Religion is meant to be a guide by which people may lead their lives, and help bring them to some sense of fulfillment. The Catholic Church is no exception, but it has been marred by centuries of conflict. Moreover, many individuals have forgotten about their spiritual development in favor of pursuing their own arguments (which often become redundant). Granted, the church is not perfect, and no institution is. There are very real problems that require attention; however, the greater problem arises when people fixate more upon such issues as policy and clerical behavior, than they do about growing in a faith tradition and becoming more spiritually aware of their lives.
That being said, the Church requires consistent maintenance, and we need to understand that there is a human element driving it. Thus, it has its flaws and doctrinal conflicts will inevitably stir, as they always have. To grossly oversimplify, some things will change, and others will stay the same. There are some facets of Catholicism that are immutable, and others that have simply become “outdated.” The thing to keep in mind is that human nature tends to stay the same, though cultural values may shift over the years. So long as we remain human, we will continue to assign blame. Yet, at the same time, another part of our being human is the capacity for progress and growth, which will assist in correcting Church-related issues. The Church should ideally be a hallmark of stability , though we need to care that it does not become stagnant.
