Though there is a definite presence of gender discrimination in the world today, I do not feel it is something that can be legislated upon. Such measures in the workforce would doubtlessly be similar to something like affirmative action, which I feel is unfair. As it is now, with no laws or rules preventing women from doing anything that men are allowed to do, is the way it should be. That is all we can ask for. Once we start trying to create laws to enforce equality, all we end up doing is shifting the balance of equality to one party’s favor, thus creating inequality. When it comes to gender discrimination, I feel it is more a result of human nature. Though there are many women who desire to work and live the same as men in the workforce do, there are just as many, if not more, that would rather live at home, raise their children, and have their husband make the money. Though I am not saying either choice is right or wrong, women must realize that they are given this choice of either working or staying at home and procreating, a choice that most men are not given. It may be somewhat harder for women to find as high-paying jobs as some men, but the reality is that this is all men have. Also, women have only somewhat recently worked their way into industry and started taking jobs that were usually held by men. I think that the present situation of women not earning as much as or being hired as often as men should be seen as a beginning, showing definite progress towards equality. Soon enough, if women keep getting the same educations as men and going for more high-paying jobs, I feel that the field will balance out and women will be just as successful as men in the workplace.
