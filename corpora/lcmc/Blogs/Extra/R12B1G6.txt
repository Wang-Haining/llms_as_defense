Several years ago, I was opposed to the idea of homosexual marriage, or any sort of union between gay individuals. However, after some of my closest friends told me that they were gay, I came to realize that my initial reaction was unfounded and incredibly irrational. I am now in support of gay marriage, and it seems that preventative measures are merely going to cause further controversy. On the most basic level, I affirm that, as we are all human, we all deserve the opportunity for happiness. While I realize that this sounds intensely cliche, it has become easy to forget. Some claim homosexuality to be the result of a genetic malformation, or faulty brain chemistry. There is also talk about a “gay gene” having been isolated. This opens an entirely new world of thought, specifically the question of whether or not measures should be taken to “correct a genetic defect.” It seems absurd to me, but there are some who contend that homosexuality is reversible through therapy and medication, or some combination of the two. Some church groups have sponsored counseling as well. A friend of mine was sent to a psychologist after telling his mother about his homosexuality, and I do not think that it was fair to him in the least. The question also arises as to whether or not homosexuality is the result of individual choice, and it certainly does not seem (to me at least) that it is. Some debate over genetic factors and environmental aspects in a sort of nature versus nurture setup has arisen as well. Some people say that those wo claim to be homosexuals are merely “confused” and uncertain of their true biological inclinations, and have instead manufactured the entire notion of homosexuality altogether. While the notion of confusion is at least somewhat feasible, the idea of “forged” homosexuality seems entirely bizarre.
