I always find the church to be a weird topic of debate. I don’t get it. If you don’t agree with the church, then don’t. It’s not the government or anything of great concern to us. If you don’t agree with the church, you can just stop going. If you do agree then keep going. These are not things you can so easily say about other issues, like something involving a national law or women’s rights or gays getting married. These are things that affect us as a nation – a nation we don’t want to leave, just make better. This is all fine, because as long as we live in the U.S., these matters may have some concern to us. But the church? The church is disposable. Whether the church allows females to be priests or priests to get married does not affect us in any way, to be honest. If you are one of those people who really wants with every inch of your soul to be Catholic and make the church better, it seems to be a hopeless cause. The church runs itself, it is not a democracy. I apologize if it sounds like I’m too dismissive or something, but I just cannot get myself to care what the church does. If anything, why not let females be priests? The church should realize that if they could maybe make some progressive change like that, maybe they will get more followers or have more followers now be happier. If they don’t want to, then whatever. It shouldn’t be seen as some kind of chauvinist thing, since they always make up some kind of answer in which they basically say, “Don’t question the church.” Because they know it will not hurt them too bad. As long as they already spread their message around that you have to go to church in order to worship God, what can they say or do to make you stop going? I don’t know about you, but I’m fine with that. I don’t question them, they don’t question me. If you don’t agree with them, then stop going. Or else they will keep doing what they’re doing forever.
