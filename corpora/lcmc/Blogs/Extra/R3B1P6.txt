Almost anyone would agree that they don’t want any further terrorist attacks on the United States, or in the world for that matter.  Realist people also acknowledge that in order to effectively catch these terrorists that they have to make some sacrifices and change some habits.  For example, traveling bye air is no longer as easy and carefree as it once was.  But this is a small price to pay to avoid a repeat of the horrific terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  However, I do not think sacrificing some of my most valued privacy rights is appropriate.  I know that there are not government officials who are literally sitting and listening to me talk to others, but it just doesn’t seem to be within my rights to not know when and why they are taping my conversations or can see my emails.  The thought of it creeps me out.  Is the next step setting up video cameras in homes and businesses, or getting into trouble for things we say in privacy?  The terms of the Patriot Act seems to clearly violate Americans’ privacy rights on a regular basis.  As for being able to examine medical records, this topic particularly aggravates me.  I realize that giving someone who has insurance costs a great deal for insurance companies, but I believe that every American, sick or not, has a right to a form of medical insurance.  It is terrible that people who can’t afford to pay their bills are dying of diseases that could be cured with the right treatment.  Genetic testing should not be allowed to be considered for the retrieval of medical insurance or job hirings.  If a person if able to perform effectively and diligently in their job, then there is no reason for not hiring them.  If this person is putting the people of the company at risk or harm, that’s a different story.  Every person deserves privacy, that’s why we choose to live in America with such rights.  For companies and the government to invade that is wrong.
