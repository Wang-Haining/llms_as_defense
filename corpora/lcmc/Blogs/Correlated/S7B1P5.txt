I believe that as citizens of the United States everyone is entitled to a certain level of privacy. But then again the right to privacy can be taken granted for. If everyone in this country were legitimate people and never attempted to wrong people in anyway the right to complete and total privacy of the citizens of the U.S. would be understood. But because we have people like the guy who killed innocent people at Virginia Tech., we have to constantly be apprehensive about the capability of certain people. However, I do think the idea think the idea of a National ID system is an excellent idea, as a means of keeping track of everyone in the U.S. but this goes to show that the government will always have some control over its people. And it’s the bad people that make living in this country so tiring for everyone else who are just trying to make a good life for themselves and their family.
 
Also I believe the companies and employers should gather as much information as possible on their employees so that they could use it fro possible networking but also if something were to happen like money was being stolen from the company, it would have a way of aiding to the capture of the culprit instead of taking extra time to find out their personal information. Nevertheless, there is always that one person that makes all of these ideas difficult to execute. Furthermore, although I do agree on the collection of all of this information, I do not agree on it to be open to any and everyone. I believe that if the information including medical information needs to accessed by any higher authority then a warrant is needed and if anyone needs to access someone’s information that they have no legal rights to then their needs to be extensive paper work and time to be put into receiving the information.
