I believe that it is time for the Catholic Church to change its ways. We live in a society that is fast paced and always changing. It is time for the Catholic Church to update their beliefs to fit with what the current society needs.
These days we hardly ever here of young men entering the priesthood. Although still looked on as a position of respect, there are few who decide to devote their lives to it. Why is this? Many would argue that the Catholic Church does not have the following that it once did. In the generations that preceded us church was regularly attended every Sunday by most Catholics. Now, I can’t name more then a handful of people who still dedicate themselves to go every week. Can this lack of incoming priests be related to a lack of following?
And what is causing this decline in faith? There are some practices of the church that are very outdated. The Catholic Church does not believe in birth control, but there are times when natural family planning is not going far enough. In the case of a woman, of childbearing age, who has four children and cannot support another, is her only choice abstinence? Also, the church does not condone the lifestyles of homosexual men and women. The gay community in America as well as other countries is rapidly rising. This goes back to our discussion on gay marriage. If it is decided that homosexuality is a genetically decided factor in our lives, is it fair to tell these men and women they can’t follow a particular religion?
On the other hand, the Catholic Church can’t be too quick to change (and they haven’t been.) If the Church changed their beliefs with every passing fad, no one would find the need to believe in it at all. But now, in our time, there are certainly some adjustments that could be made by the Catholic Church.
