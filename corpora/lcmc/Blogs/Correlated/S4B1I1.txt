It should not be a surprise for me to say that the Iraq war has not turned out like many of us thought, including President Bush.  The objectives were to remove Saddam Hussein (which was accomplished) and eradicate terrorists from Iraq (which was not accomplished).  Like the article stated, terrorists flocked to Iraq from surrounding areas in order to bring the fight to the U.S.  This was undoubtedly a critical oversight by the planners of the war.  However, President Bush, Congress, and the presidential advisors do not have a crystal ball with which to tell the future.  They only have bits and pieces of intelligence from a finite number of sources.  I’m sure they received intelligence that suggested the presence of WMD’s and a link to Al Qaeda.  That does not necessarily mean that such information was accurate.  They decided to invade Iraq because they believed that the danger was too great to ignore.  I cannot fault the decision makers for trying to do their jobs.  Could they have made a huge mistake?  Sure, but who among us does not make mistakes?
Even though the Iraq war cannot be called a success, some good things were accomplished.  Saddam is dead, his sons are dead, and many Al Qaeda leaders are either dead or imprisoned (i.e. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed).  I don’t think many people understand just how oppressive Saddam’s regime was.  Saddam, whose hero was none other than Joseph Stalin, had close to absolute power over the people of Iraq.  He had an extensive secret police force that he used to snuff out dissent - meaning that whoever publicly opposed him was tortured and/or executed.  Moreover, Saddam has used WMD’s of the chemical variety on the Kurds in the northern part of his own country in the 1980’s when they aided the Iranians in the Iran-Iraq War.  In light of these circumstances, it is clear that Saddam’s regime was intolerable.
