In my big-mouthed, pretentious opinion, the global “war on terror” is one of the most ill-conceived political notions I’ve ever heard of. It was a hasty response to America’s post-9/11 fears, and was meant to restore faith in the U.S. government at a time when people felt it had failed. They wanted to give us something to rally around in a time of crisis. September 11th truly hit home for us; for the first time since the cold war, Americans felt tangibly affected by political crisis. The “war on terror” was a vague, half-assed response to this.
What exactly is “terror”? Exactly what, and who, are we fighting against? What does terror look like? Does it always wear a turban? Does it always have distinguishable qualities? Is it just an emotion, or is it embodied by specific people? A war against the dictionary definition of “terror” (an emotion) would be fought by psychiatric professionals, right? The fatal ambiguity of our “war on terror” is that IT MAY ONLY EXIST AS A SECONDARY CONCEPT, WE MUST FIRST DEFINE TERROR!!
So who gets to define terror? Obviously somebody messed up when they defined “terror” as “Iraq”. Obviously, the executive branch had an agenda in mind before it even looked at its intelligence data, and it interpreted all such data accordingly. The entire intelligence community, as those who often take the fall for ill-decisions at the top, must have been really pissed off when those at the top IGNORED intel conclusions that Iraq disequals Al-Quaeda.
We aren’t talking about some chickenshit political fiasco, we are talking about the ENTIRE military and economic might of one of the greatest countries in the world. If we are going to fling that muuch power around, we BETTER know EXACTLY who, what, where, when, why, and how its going to happen, or else the international community will decapitate our legitimacy. The war on terror simply does NOT, and has NOT, satisfied these things.
