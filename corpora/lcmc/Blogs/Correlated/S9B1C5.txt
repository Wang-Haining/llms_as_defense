As a member of the Roman Catholic Church, there are certain traditions that I believe should be changed, those that perpetuate inequality and gender discrimination, as well as those that were formed for reasons that no longer matter in our present society.  I am talking about the exclusion of women from the priesthood, and the rules that do not allow priests to get married and have families once they have become priests (because there are cases in which a married man, usually a minister in a different Christian Church, is allowed to convert to Catholicism and become a priest).  There are many good reasons to allow women into the priesthood besides the simple fact that the way it is now the Church condones inequality.  Like the discussion starter mentions, there is severe dearth of priests in the Catholic Church.  I’m sure there are a number of women who gladly fill those open positions if given the chance.  Isn’t denying them the chance just hurting the congregations?  I also think that it would have been much more difficult for the priest sex scandals to remain a secret as long as they did if women had been members of the clergy.
 
With regard to marriage, it was only in the 11th century that the Church decided that priests could no longer get married.  At that time, the Church was the most powerful institution in Europe, and its officials, including priests, owned a lot of land.  The Church didn’t want to lose this land to the families of the priests, and so they forbad priests to get married.  Yes, there were spiritual arguments offered for the change in tradition, but the main motives behind the decision were power and greed.
Having said all that, I believe that the tenets of the Catholic faith are very important in today’s society.  Considering the fast-pace changes that occur in all areas of our lives, technology, science, entertainment, etc., I think that it’s essential to have at least one stable, steadfast presence in our lives.
