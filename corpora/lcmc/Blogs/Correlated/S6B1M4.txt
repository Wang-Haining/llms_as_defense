The stigma attached to marijuana is unwarranted and has been around for far too long (Just for the record, “Reefer Madness” is hysterical, though). The government already condones alcohol and tobacco, and while some studies have shown that marijuana contains more carcinogens then tobacco, it’s used much less frequently. Casual marijuana smokers tend to use it two or three times a week, whereas tobacco smokers usually smoke three or four times a day.
I think that one of the primary reasons the government isn’t willing to legalize it is because they believe it would be hard to tax and track marijuana sales. The underground market for it is already well-entrenched, and most people who already grow, sell, and buy it this way probably aren’t going to suddenly want to switch to a system in which they can by it legally for more expensive prices (since it would be taxed. The price depends upon the old law of supply and demand, though, of course). This isn’t an example of the government weighing things according to what benefits the people, but rather it’s them worrying about how they’re going to make money off the deal.
The strain current marijuana laws put on our judicial systems and prisons can’t be overestimated, either. So much time and money is wasted busting people for relatively minor infractions that laws that are more lenient would benefit the country in general.
A couple people seem concerned about the possibility of higher incidences of DUIs with the legalization of pot. I don’t think the number of incidences would be any higher than those of drunk driving, though, and would probably be lower.
I also haven’t met anyone who smokes pot purely for the “thrill” of doing something illegal. Most people I’ve met who smoke seem to do it because they enjoy its (usually) mellowing effects and the way it temporarily enhances (or obscures) their normal perceptions of the world. That’s why most potheads sit around watching TV or listening to music.
