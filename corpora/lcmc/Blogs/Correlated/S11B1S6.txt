How the hell is gender discrimination any different from ANY kind of racism?  A woman and a man can do the exact same thing.  It drives me crazy when people separate it.  And it happens both ways sadly.  My family is full of stay at home moms, but they would never expect me to stay home just because I’m a woman.  Yet, I’ve seen numerous families where that exact thing happens.  You would never see a father telling his son to stay at home and raise a family.  Countless girls have told me “Oh I’m just in college so I can work until I get married.”  It’s insanity in my mind.
I get that gender discrimination has been around as long as civilization, but that doesn’t mean we can’t change it.  Just like with any other kind of racism, it can be stopped or at least changed with the effort of man.  We claim as a civilization to be “open-minded” but this just proves that we really aren’t , this is just something we just can’t get rid of.  We can’t get away from the thought that women can only be mothers and wives, or the idea that men have to be the bread winners.  Even today when we routinely have men staying home with the kids and women going into the workplace, it’s not really accepted.  It’s looked at oddly, it’s looked at…as strange, almost as wrong.
It’s funny, every time that I tell people that I might never have a family, because I don’t see it fitting in my career plan, I get the oddest looks.  When a man says that he has a career path with no room for a family, he’s looked at as a driven young man ,and a woman is looked at as an oddity.  Scares the crap outta me.
