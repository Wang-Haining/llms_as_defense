I think there is a definite need for the Catholic Church to modernize.  For starters, they should allow women to become priests.  By not doing so, they are sending a message that women aren’t equal to men.  Isn’t one of the central teachings of Jesus that all people are created equal?  Women are perfectly capable of fulfilling priestly duties.  There are numerous Protestant denominations that allow women to become priests, and it seems to work for them.  It is the Church itself that is losing out because it refuses to let women become priests.  What will happen when there aren’t enough male priests?  Such a situation is fast approaching.
I think one of the reasons why the Church is reluctant to change anything is the fact that it would seem like a sign of weakness.  If the Church has gone on for this long, it might seem like it has made a mistake in not allowing women priests.  The Church really isn’t about admitting mistakes (after all, the pope is infallible, right?).  By just keeping the status quo, the Church can go on thinking that all they do in this world is right.
I also think the Church should allow priests to marry.  This would attract a large number of young men to the dwindling ranks of priesthood.  The Church will say that priests can devote themselves only to God.  I really don’t think a spouse would detract from their devotion to God.  Again, a lot of Protestant denominations allow their priests to marry, and it seems to work just fine.
The Church should definitely change its views on homosexuality.  If homosexuality is indeed genetic, the Church is just discriminating against people who have no control over something.  To call it a sin to be gay is just wrong.  As science advances, so does our knowledge.  The Church should accept this knowledge and change its ways accordingly.
