My home town is made up of working women and stay at home moms. My mother is a part time worker and full time mother. I do not feel the people around me have experienced gender discrimination but choose their occupations. Some families are not lucky enough to be able to survive on one income, some can, and others choose to have multiple incomes. I think it is great that women have progressed and are able to have an equal chance in the work world. At the same time, I feel that some women feminists condemn those that CHOOSE to stay at home. In my opinion staying at home is an equally respectable job that requires hard work and talent.
My aunt was a special education teacher until she became a full time mother with three kids. Her eldest has graduated college, her middle is a freshman in college, and her youngest is thirteen. She has decided to go back to teach as a substitute for elementary school children. In my opinion, my cousin’s have become decent members of society. As I mentioned before, my mother worked part- time and was a full time mother. She continues to work in order to pay for our education. I feel that my brothers and I have turned out as responsible and respectable individuals. I believe a woman’s choice is very important. The fact that my mother and aunt were able to choose what they wanted to do is a luxury many women may not have.
I feel that a woman’s role can be somewhat underestimated and looked down upon by females in the working field. One can not know what something is like until they experience it. Working women should not criticize stay at home moms. Stay at home moms should not criticize working women. Each person satisfies their special needs by spending their time differently. I applaud women feminists for their hard work in battling oppression against our gender. Luckily I have not experienced gender discrimination, but do understand that it exists.
