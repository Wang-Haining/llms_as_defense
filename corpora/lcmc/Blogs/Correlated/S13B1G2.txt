           I agree with many of the ideas stated in the previous two posts.  In regards to laws about gay marriage basically what I think is, “Who are we to decide that two people who love each other can not get married?”  I don’t think that there is any legitimate argument for banning gay marriage.  What right does the government have to make such a law?  I like the analogy brought up about comparing this situation to banning left-handed people from operating a forklift.
            Some of the arguments that I have heard against gay marriage seem to confuse a legal marriage with a church marriage.  If someone gets married in the Catholic Church, for example, they obtain a civil marriage license and ALSO go through a certain process within the Church.  While the Church might have its own reasons for not allowing homosexuals to marry within the Church, I see no reason why the couple should be denied a civil marriage.   As stated, the decisions of a specific religious group “have no proper bearing on the law.”  I definitely feel that this is one area where religious opponents of gay marriage have faulty logic: they confuse the idea of the sacrament of marriage with the legal right to marry.
            With all of this talk about marriage, we must ask ourselves why people get married.  It is possible to live together and/or to have children without being married, so why do people get married??  I think that one reason is that in marrying someone, you are saying that you love them so much that you are willing to commit yourself to a lifelong relationship with them.  I believe that if two people, heterosexual or homosexual, are so  much in love that they are willing to make this serious a commitment, as an outsider to their relationship, I have no right at all to tell this couple that they can not enter into this union.
