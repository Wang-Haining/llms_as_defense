The Catholic Church should recognize that the world is changing and they should change with it because whether they want to realize it or not the older generation is dying off and the new generation is a sex-crazed generation. We’ve grown up with sex; sex has gotten to the point that it’s even in g-rated movies. Also the whole notion of women not being allowed to be priests is another reason why they are having so much trouble, I mean why are they keeping women subordinate to men, these aren’t the old days, women can be as great of a priest as men can. Hardly anyone is going to want to be a priest if they can’t have sex; it’s gotten to a point that we are expected to have sex at some point in our lives whether we want to start it at an early age or wait until we are married.
 
Also I understand what the rest of the reading is saying but they also don’t want to lose a valued numbered of priests and parishioners all because the church wants to be stuck in their traditions. Maybe if they waited a little to make sure that it’s not a growing trend across the country and the world. Because what many seem to forget is that Catholicism isn’t just here, it’s all over the world so we have to look at the fact that our younger generation may be changing but others may not. I feel the church also needs to target the youth, a lot of catholic sermons are very dry and uneventful, not to say that they need to be as exciting as Baptist churches but the reason so many people get into Baptist sermons are because they are speaking on issues that affect their parishioners in their everyday life.
