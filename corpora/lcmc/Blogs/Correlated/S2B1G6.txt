After reading the discussion starter and pondering this topic over the course of this research project, it occurs to me that there is no legitimate reason why gay marriage should be outlawed.
The only valid argument that could be used against gay marriage is the danger of ending procreation altogether, which would only happen if everyone in the world were homosexual and never procreated.  However, this argument is meaningless unless being homosexual turned out to be dependent on personal choice alone.  In recent times, as research into the “gay gene” looms ever closer, the chance that homosexuality is dependent upon one’s genes and not one’s personal choice is getting greater and greater.  Even without the “gay gene,” one can not say a person would choose to be gay for any good reason.  First, it is against physical nature (the parts only fit together one way).  Second, to declare oneself as gay in this world is accepting a life of possible mockery and hatred.  Fortunately, this is not as much of a worry in our world today as it was a half century ago.
As it is shown that being homosexual is not one’s choice,  one’s sexuality becomes an impersonal trait, just like gender or skin color.  For anyone to discriminate against someone based on this kind of trait is a crime and should never be practiced.  Thus, there should be no difference between opposite sex marriage and same sex marriage.
Instead of legalizing same sex marriage, one solution that has been suggested is to allow homosexuals to get married and call it something else.  This solution is a insult, a slap in the face, against homosexuals and should not be practiced.  To refer to a homosexual marriage as another term is to acknowledge the discrimination that exists and is causing the problem in the first place.  It is getting around the problem and not solving it - shutting up a discriminated population to create an “easy fix” in our society today.
