The church is an interesting topic for me to discuss.  I was raised both catholic and protestant and now I’m leaning heavily towards neither.  But I have to be honest, before I say anything about the issues in and surrounding the Catholic Church there’s something else I need to say.  There is a problem with any organized religion on the planet because, lets face it, no one is going to agree on every little point.  It’s just not going to happen.  But the Catholic Church has its own problems.  In regards to some things it seems like the Church is still stuck in the Dark Ages.  Women can’t be part of the clergy, well why the hell not?  Women can do anything men can do, and some things that they can’t.  It’s ridiculous to not give them the option to pledge their lives to the clergy, and not just as a nun.  I don’t care that the church is supposed to be infallible; it’s a chauvinistic tradition.  This isn’t even a rule set down by the bible; it’s a tradition that was made by the church in a time where women couldn’t own property.  It really makes no sense for this “rule” to be in place.
Another “rule” that has no place in our society today is the rule that priests can’t marry.  This is another one that has no actual religious backdrop.  Priests originally were allowed to have families and marry, however the Church realized that if priests had sons, their land and money went to their sons rather than the church.  This is a prime example of how the church is run by man, who is not infallible.  I can’t help but see this as a problem.  These aren’t things that are mandated by God or even the Word of God, but by man.  Who are we to tell someone who wants to have love, or a woman who wants to devote her life to the church by teaching the populace the word of God that they cannot do it?
