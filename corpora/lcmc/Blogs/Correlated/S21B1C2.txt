I believe that it is crucial for the church to change. People must remember that the church was established over a thousand years and stories of Jesus were written over 60 years after his death. the times have changed. I am not saying that the church should change what they believe in because then catholicism would not be a religion, I am simply saying that the church must become more open - minded and realize that times have changed. Being a catholic myself, I feel like I represent how the majority of other catholics view the church. I think that it is somewhat narrow - minded and I don’t like that all decisions are left to be decided by one man. I do not believe in the hierarchy that the church has established. Due to the fact that the church was established over a thousand years ago the church needs to be revamped and become the church of the present day. Unlike Jesus’ time, women now have rights, we do not stone people anymore, and equal rights is a huge part of our society. I feel that women would make wonderful priests and that the church is only hurting itself by not allowing them to become such. Already the church is lacking priests, allowing women to become priests would only benefit them. However, at the same time, I see how this could be somewhat contradictory to what the Bible says. Although is it not to be taken literally, it is clearly stated that women should not be ordained priests and that the idea of having only male priests was based solely upon the 12 Apostles. Again, this took place in a male - dominated society so it is a tough call. I believe that me, being a young, catholic woman who believes in the more liberal aspect of the church, has the same views of others my age. I am for women’s rights and I believe that the church must be updated. We are long overdue.
