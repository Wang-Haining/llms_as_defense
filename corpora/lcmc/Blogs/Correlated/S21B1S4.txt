Have you ever been made fun of or criticized because you were the only boy around or the only girl around? Speaking from experience, it makes someone feel awkward, exposed, and like they do not belong, like they are not good enough. Recently, I was at the FAC late at night to play basketball with a bunch of male friends. We were all excited to play until I entered the gym. It was full of boys, only boys. They began to play without me because they only wanted to play with my male friends. They did not even give me a chance. Just because I was a girl, I was automatically not good enough to play with them or even against them. I felt terrible about myself. However, my male friends stood up for me and said that they would not play unless I could play with them. So, we eventually played against them and won by a landslide, it was almost embarrassing. I felt so great about myself and the friends I had. This experience made me realize that there are still people in our society today that still hold feelings such as these against the opposite sex. But, at the same time, it made me realize that their are people, like my friends, that do not have these feelings, that the world is slowly changing and adapting to this change in society. Women are now equals and have been for a long time. They are getting higher paying jobs and higher educations. They are now becoming mothers and CEO’s. The average age that a woman gets pregnant has went up about six years. This means that women are staying in school longer to receive higher educations. This process of acceptance is still in the works but in a few years, it will eventually pan out.
