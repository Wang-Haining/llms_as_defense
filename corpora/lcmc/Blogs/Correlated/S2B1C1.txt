While it may be important to avoid trivialization of Church traditions by keeping them consistent, the advantages of their modification may be worth the risk.  As the world continues to change on a daily basis, the Catholic Church is getting left behind.  In general, people are not able to embrace traditions so ancient that the reasons for their existence are becoming obscured.  As was said, celibacy and a male priesthood are not vital to the message the Catholic Church means to portray.  If, after changing these traditions, a new wave of dedicated priests/priestesses emerges and a revitalization of faith occurs amongst Catholic followers, what harm is done?  If nothing is done, and the priesthood continues to decline at the rate it is going, no priests will be left to live by the traditions the Church has kept secure. 

Ultimately, I leave these questions up to the Church.  Regardless of personal opinion, the Vatican, with its legions of dedicated theologians, holds the most comprehensive and in-depth knowledge and understanding of the Bible, our only connection to something that at least resembles God’s word.  While we can never, as mortals, perfectly interpret the word of God, the Vatican is certainly in the best position to take that role.  It is as if I attempted to argue with a botanist about whether a plant is poison ivy or not.  Who would you trust?  Obviously, some matters have more subjective content than others, but what viable solution can be presented that will decide on the “most Catholic” answer to these questions while maintaining the Church’s stability?  The Church is in a very difficult position.  Similarly to politicians, the Church has a world of people to please, people with infinitely different points of view.  Should the Church change its long established traditions to please a portion of its followers?  I don’t know, but I’m leaving it up to the Church itself to reach the answer.
