The legalization of marijuana, although not one of the biggest issues in news today, is causing commotion throughout the country. Marijuana has been used for medicinal reasons in some states, and this has opened the door to talk of a more widespread use for the substance.
First off I see no reason why marijuana should not be used for medicinal purposes. In cases such as cancer and terminal illnesses, if marijuana could make them more comfortable and ease their pain then it should be used.
On top of this reason, I don’t see why it should not be legal to be used recreationally. Compared to other drugs such as cocaine and LSD, marijuana has not been shown to have nearly the same effects or health risks. Furthermore, marijuana is natural, so compared to even cigarettes; it does not hold the same deadly chemical in a cigarette.
Some of the arguments against marijuana are that we would be faced with the same problems as alcohol such as drinking on the job and driving while under the influence. If marijuana was legal we would be faced with these problems in the same way as alcohol. There are people now who drink on the job and get away with it, so that would still be a risk. Also, I think that many people are already using or have used marijuana even though it is illegal. The law against it doesn’t seem to be keeping many people from obtaining it.
I feel as though marijuana should be legalized. The only flaw to this is that if it were legalized the government would have the power to tax it. Therefore, it would become more expensive to buy and those who are already selling it might continue to sell it. There would have to be strong regulations from the government if they don’t want there to be other people selling it.
