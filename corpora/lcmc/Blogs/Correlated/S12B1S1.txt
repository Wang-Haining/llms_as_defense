Certainly the 20th century has brought a great deal more of conflict dealing with gender discrimination.  For the most part, it would seem, females and males were comfortable in their roles up until the events in the middle 1900s.  The movement to abolish gender discrimination is just as necessary as was the movement to end slavery and other forms of discrimination.  Whether you are a woman, a black person, a handicapped person, or any other person who has some sort of “physical difference”, that is by no means sound evidence to base discrimination on.
The 20th century, and now the 21st century, has seen a large push to unveil these discrimination and diversity issues:  companies have enacted diversity boards to oversee the diversity management and hiring of their workplaces and educational institutions have started affirmative actions plans to give the “tiebreakers” to the minority.  All of these steps are certainly necessary and are starting to change the value of diversity in this country and across the world from worthless to invaluable.
Dealing with the feministic movement, in particular, the reasons for erasing the prejudice are just as sound as erasing other forms of discrimination.  Having more females in upper management positions within companies or higher up position in an education institution allow a more rounded viewpoint on the best interests of those respective institutions moving forward.  How can a marketing firm truly meet all of the market segments without a sound female in an upper management role to see that the 50% or the market she has great knowledge on is best represented?  In only makes sense to put females, equally with males, in key decision making roles because their diverse thoughts will bring new perspectives and new ideas to the table that can only benefit in brain storming sessions and otherwise.
