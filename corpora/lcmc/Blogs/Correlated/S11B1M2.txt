Let’s be dead honest here.  Most people today have at least tried pot.  A good number of those who have tried pot have done it more than once.  Now personally I can’t see much of a difference between alcohol use and pot use.  Both are harmful to the person, and alcohol really doesn’t have any use in the medical field (not drinkable alcohol anyway) but yet it’s legal.  People drink and drive and end up killing people, but alcohol is still legal.  People overdue alcohol and destroy their lives, but it’s still legal.  I think that when the argument about how pot use will boom and we will end up having people not working or coming to work stoned or going to class stoned is used we aren’t giving humanity enough credit.  Not everyone is going to be a burnout, just like not everyone is going to be an alcoholic.  It’s all about personal choices.  Why should one harmful chemical be legal and the other not? Then there’s the argument that marijuana can be harmful to your health.  Well what about liver failure and kidney failure from alcohol?  Anything done out of moderation is going to be bad for your health.  At least marijuana can be used for some good medically.  To be honest, I don’t think people would start using marijuana all the time, obviously some people would, but not all of them.  Our economy wouldn’t crash; our way of life wouldn’t change.  There’s another argument that if alcohol is legal then we shouldn’t need marijuana to be legal.  Let’s be honest, we don’t really need either of them, but if one is legal they both should be, or neither.  I don’t think that use would boom if it was made legal, the novelty of doing something “illegal” will be gone, so that base of reasoning will be done with.  Most people don’t drink insanely just because they turn 21, so why would that happen with marijuana?
