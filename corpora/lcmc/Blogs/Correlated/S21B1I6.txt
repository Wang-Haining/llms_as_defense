After September 11, 2001, the United States was in turmoil. People wanted to take action, they wanted to see these terrorists be captured and locked up, they were sad, hurt, confused, and scared. President Bush, I believe, had no other choice but to declare war on these nations. If we didn’t, we would risk the fact that these terrorist organizations might think that they have weakened and beaten us, which they have not. It could have lead to even more deadly attacks. In the beginning, this war seemed like a good thing. Then, slowly but surely, we began to lose focus on what we went in their to do and now we are stuck. If we leave, we risk more terrorist attacks and a possible downfall of what we tried to build their, a governing body. If we stay, we only lose more money and more American lives. I was one of those Americans whom at first, was all for the war. I wanted to see the terrorists be captured and I wanted them to feel the pain that they caused our nation to feel on that day. I lost five people on September 11, 2001. My family was scared, saddened, and angry. As time went on, I just kept seeing that we were just losing more and more lives. We were making more and more family’s feel the way my family did on that day. I is unnecessary for us to stay their and, moreover, keep sending more men over. I believe that the people over there are always going to be stuck in their own ways, they have been for years. And, if they can’t stop fighting with themselves, then we certainly cannot help them. The people over there also think that we are interfering with their culture and all that. I am sick of hearing that. If they do not want our help, then I don’t see why we should sacrifice anymore men and women.
