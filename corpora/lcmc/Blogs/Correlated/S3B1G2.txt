I feel like we all pretty much agree on this one. I see no reason gay couples should be prevented from getting married, and to this point I have heard no convincing arguments against gay marriage. There are the old standard points: procreation is a part of marriage, gay couples will change the meaning of family… but procreation is not a part of all marriages (and who are we to tell people who are unable to have children together that their marriage is invalid??) and homosexuals share the same family styles as heterosexual couples. I wonder what people are afraid will happen if gay couples are married. What would change? Gay couples already live together and raise families together… they deserve to do so in the same legal standing as heterosexual couples.
It may not be the most common argument, but the most emotional argument I’ve heard against gay marriage is religious. In the Catholic Church and many other churches and religions, gay couples can’t be married. People don’t want a governmental approval of gay marriage to interfere with the workings of their church, so they are against it. In reality, all the legalization of gay marriage would do is give homosexual couples the same legal standing as heterosexual couples – their natural right. Nowhere in legislation is there any mention of forcing churches to perform ceremonies marrying homosexuals. Gay marriage would just be the legal recognition that gay couples have an equal status to straight ones.
The trouble in agreeing on gay marriage comes when people let their emotions take them over. It’s possible to disagree in principle with something and still politically approve of it. Just because a group of people believe that gay marriage is somehow morally wrong, does that make homosexuals less human and less deserving of the rights which we all share? Legal rights have to be separated from personal opinions to really ensure equality.
