There seem to be several economic and social advantages to the legalization of marijuana.  It would be taking money and power out of the hands of drug traffickers and providing more revenue for the government.  Also, based on the example of other European countries such as Holland, where the rate of young adolescent usage of marijuana is lower than in the United States, legalizing the drug would take away the thrill of rebellion, and hopefully the overuse and abuse of the drug.
There should, however, I believe, be laws that regulate the right of a person who consumes marijuana to operate a vehicle, something analogous to the laws that regulate drinking and driving.
I think it should be noted that marijuana receives a lot more attention than it may deserve.  I read an article in the newspaper the other day about sleeping pills and the harmful effects that were being discovered.  Certain pills caused people to get in their car and drive while asleep, equally if not more dangerous than driving drunk or high.  Yet these pills remain legal forms of medication, and there is no great public outcry against them. 

Indeed, if people in the United States are legally allowed to slowly kill themselves by smoking cigarettes, I don’t see why they shouldn’t be able to smoke pot.  The difference is, however, the amount of research done on the effects of each of these substances.  I agree that a greater amount of studies needs to be performed before the legalization of recreational marijuana. 

I’d just like to make another point about the nature of legal implementation.  As is the case with alcohol and cigarettes, I think that there should be a minimum legal age for using marijuana.  Although, just as there have been political debates about the proper drinking age and the proper smoking age (in New Jersey just last year, the age was raised to 19), there are bound to be a number of disagreements over the minimum age for using marijuana.
