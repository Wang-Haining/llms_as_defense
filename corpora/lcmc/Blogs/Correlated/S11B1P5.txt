Privacy?  In this day and age we don’t even know what the hell privacy is.  With communication the way it is we don’t know the meaning of the word.  People can steal your identity as easy as look at you.  If you have a computer you have the ability to get all of the information that exists on planet earth, and its not that hard to invade people’s privacy with it.
When it comes to Id’s I doubt we’ll be able to get a better system then the one we have now.  ID’s can always be faked; no matter how “good” we think they are.  There is a whole franchise devoted to making fake ids.
Then we have “medical confidentiality”.  Should anyone have the right to discuss your medical history? If we start letting out peoples medical secrets there will be chaos.  It’d be like putting people’s religion out for all to see.  That happened once.  Some Charlie Chaplin impersonator told a whole country that if they were a certain religion they had to wear a yellow star.
What if we all had to wear labels with our history on them?  Where does it end?  Today it seems like there is no privacy to be had.  In a world where the government can decide to tap phones almost arbitrarily, where is it going to end?  Where does privacy start and safety begin?  I’m not sure anymore, it doesn’t make any more sense to me than it does to anyone else.  Seems to me we’re getting closer and closer to Orwell’s 1984 world.  Soon they’ll be able to charge us with “thought crime”, and monitor our every movement.  How soon will it be till we have screens in every room watching us, making sure we don’t break any rules?  How soon until every little thing we do is catalogued and watched?
