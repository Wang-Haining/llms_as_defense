In my opinion, the war in Iraq has gone on for way too long.  It scares me to think that more troops are being sent over, when we should instead be working on a way to pull out of Iraq.  The question of what exactly that exit strategy should be is a very difficult one.  On the one hand, I would love to see all of our soldiers come back home safely now.  But on the other hand, as much as I don’t believe in the way in which this war was started, I also don’t believe that it would be right for us to just leave right now.  The situation is such a mess right now because of what we initiated, and I feel that it would be wrong of us to leave after completely upsetting whatever political structure Iraq had in the first place.  Since we started this, we have a certain obligation to “clean up after ourselves” and at least try to restore some order.  However, I also feel that what we need to do in not take Iraq by the hand and wait patiently as it takes every little baby step.  We need to just finish our business over there in as efficient and timely a manner as possible and get out once we have done this.
 
In response to the discussion starter’s mention of the war in Iraq in relation to the war on terrorism, I am part of the 57% of Americans who feel that the Iraq War is not part of the War on Terror.  The war in Afghanistan was a direct retaliation against the attack of September 11th, 2001, but I believe that to try to make a direct connection between 9/11 and Iraq is not correct.  After our nation was attacked on September 11th, it would have been very strange of us not to have some sort of a response; this response was the war in Afghanistan and the attempt of find Osama bin Laden.  When Bush extended this fight against terrorism to Saddam and Iraq, he was simply playing off the fear instilled in Americans by the events of 9/11.
