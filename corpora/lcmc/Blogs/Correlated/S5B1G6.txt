According to the discussion starter, it sounds reasonable that marriage between a man and a woman be for procreation purposes. I have been taught that men and women are meant to marry under a religious ceremony and procreate. To me, marriage has always been the cover for having kids. When I imagine myself in twenty years, I envision myself as the mother of five kids. I can’t imagine being married or what my spouse will look like. In today’s age, people usually marry because they are in love or strongly attracted to another person. Sometimes the idea of a family does not even cross the couples mind when they are married- the family becomes just the two of them.
            With this change in people’s desires for a family, there has also been a change in the validity of the definition of marriage. Marriage is no longer a way to procreate, but a way to express commitment to the one person you (hopefully) truly love. For this reason, I believe that same sex marriages should be allowed. If a man and woman can be married for reasons other then procreation, then a woman and woman and man and man should have equal rights. Same sex partners can procreate through artificial insemination or even adopt together. I believe we should give all people a chance to form a family.
            I want same sex marriage to be legalized, but at the same time do not agree with the last paragraph in the discussion starter. I do not think that the legalization of same sex marriage will encourage same sex partners to settle down with one partner and form a family. I believe that these are peoples own choices and this new option will not change them. If partners want to settle down and have children, then they will, with or without the legalization of marriage. Marriage is just a title.
