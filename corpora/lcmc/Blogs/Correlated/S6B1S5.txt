Let’s clarify something, first off. “Feminism” as a theoretical designation and a movement, is a very vague term that encompasses a diverse range of beliefs and ideas. When I simply say “feminist,” I could just as easily be talking about the aesthetics of Heidi Gottner-Abendroth as the renegade social commentary of Camille Paglia, which are very, very different things. Many types of feminist theory are still prominent in academic circles, however, and have a significant role to play (Elaine Showalter’s art historical work is a good example). My point in all of this is that we have to be careful how we bandy that term about; to reduce “feminism” to a Rosy the Riveter “We can do it!” mentality that a bunch of women had in the 60s is a vast oversimplification.
Anyway, I don’t think that gender-based discrimination is still a huge problem in the United States. I think that there are still some areas of life where it remains a significant obstacle, however, and those aren’t necessarily all directly related to the workplace. The prompt describes the way in which many women feel compelled to leave home for the work place, or feel compelled to stay home to raise children. This is an internal conflict many (or even most) women still experience, and is the result of millennia of social attitudes that advocate that they should have a particular role to play. Whether or not these attitudes were unfair, considering their context, is one thing; the fact that they persist is unfair, however. How many women do you think are made to feel like bad mothers for leaving their children at daycare? By comparison, how many fathers do you think are made to feel like bad parents for doing the same? (Answer: many, and probably not many). This is the result of age-old ideas about gender roles we still maintain. Feminism wasn’t just concerned with changing the role of women in society; it was concerned with changing attitudes like these, which is why it persists and is still pertinent.
