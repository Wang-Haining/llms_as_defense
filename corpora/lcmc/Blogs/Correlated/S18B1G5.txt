the issue of gay marriage is definately one of the most controversial subjects of society today, and equally hard to have a solid stance on the matter.  the arguement does make sense that marriage represents a man and woman union because its “natural” and that they can biologically have children and start a family, but just because gay couples can’t naturally have kids does that make them have bad morals?  i don’t think so — just because they have a relationship with someone of the same sex doesn’t make them “evil”.
i think if society accepted gay people into the community, the concept of gay couples as parents wouldn’t seem so extreme.  the concept of gay parents as “farming gay kids” - not my phrase - is also ridiculous; heterosexual parents raise kids that turn out to be gay all the time, so why shouldn’t the opposite be the same?
however, if gay people are given the right to marry, i wonder what other groups of people previosly unable to get married in the way they want would push more strongly for their rights.  i don’t think this is necessarily a big issue, but it would be interesting to see if polygamous people or other groups would start to say, “hey, if they can get married, why can’t we?” either way, once the system ‘lets down their guard’, i think other groups will take advantage of the situation.
also, civil unions are really just marriage light.  marriage shouldn’t be defined by the state in regards to any religion’s definition, so really the only difference is the tax benefits as mentioned in the discussion starter post. if the government is going to give gay couples the right to civil unions, they might as well go the full nine and give them the right to marriage. Catholics can still define marriage as strictly between a man and woman - they shouldn’t care what the govenment defines it as.
