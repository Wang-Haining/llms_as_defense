i don’t think that gender discrimination exists in the sense that the term previously stood for.  what i mean by that is that i dont think that the majority of the population (or at least in the united states) views women as a lower demographic or lower caste. gender issues will always exist… i mean, unless humans become asexual, there will always be the basic (as well as the subtle) differences between a man and a woman, and those differences will need to be worked out differently as society changes. just like we’ve adapted to the times with previous issues - albeit sometimes the process was very slow - we will forever need to continually adapt our views to update with the realities of the current society.
i think there is not a very strong argument for why working women would detriment the family values of America.  similarly, i don’t think there is any argument at all for why men should be removed from household completely.
to begin, the argument that “few women seem attracted to men who engage in [childrearing and domestic tasks] to the detriment of their careers” is a clever and highly misleading one.  of course women don’t want a man who does these thing to the detriment of their careers.  any person - man or woman - wouldn’t want their spouse to be overly involved in anything that hurt their career.  This is not to say that the family should not be a prioirity before work - as a matter of fact, i think it should always be a priority before work - but the wording of the argument is very loaded and assumes that men that spend time with their families do it to a fault, or are overemotional.
as for women being “too work-oriented”, thats just plain discrimination.  a balance can be reached where both the man and woman can work and be at home - my parents did it, and you don’t have to look far for extra examples.
