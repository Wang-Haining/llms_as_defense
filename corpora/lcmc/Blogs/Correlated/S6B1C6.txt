Okay, I’d like to clarify something before I go forward. Everyone harps on the idea of “papal infallibility” as being one of the most ridiculous things the Catholic Church ever dreamed up (and it very well might be), but it’s frequently misunderstood and misrepresented. Papal infallibility is a doctrine that can only be invoked in regards to a point of theological dogma. If the Pope said, “The Yankees are a really good baseball team,” he’d obviously be wrong. From what I remember from my days in high school theology class, the doctrine of papal infallibility has only been invoked twice, on two specific, separate issues.
That said, I agree with Mtnbike9 on all of his points below. I have an uncle who is a Catholic priest, and know for a fact that many priests are under specific orders to stay quiet about any or all of those issue that were raised. We have to remember that the Catholic Church doesn’t just exist in America; it’s ruled by a hierarchical system who’s top is located on another continent. The social attitudes and ideas one finds in America don’t necessarily hold true in the rest of the world, and certainly don’t hold true in Vatican City. I think that this is one of the biggest reasons the Church hasn’t (and probably won’t, at least for a while) made any major changes in the way they go about their business.
I think that the Catholic Church stands to lose a huge amount of its members in the United States. According to a 2002 poll, about 23% of US adults identify themselves as Catholic (that’s a much larger portion than I would have guessed). We can probably expect this number to drop steadily over the next couple decades as more and more people seek what they feel to be less restrictive forms of Christianity. That is, unless the Church decides to change.
