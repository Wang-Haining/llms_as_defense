The institution of marriage is terribly broken, as can be seen by the fact that we have a 42%+ divorce rate, and eradicating gay marriage is NOT going to fix it. The “religious right” and the “liberal left” have to stop defining them along arbitrary single-issue lines like this one, because they are going nowhere. Besides, the majority of gay people who want marriage feel so because they want the LEGAL benefits (hospital visits, tax advantages of marriage, co-sign their mortgage, etc). They do not just want to marry for petty security, like so many straight couples who end up divorced. What we need to do is find a COMPROMISE, one that allows gay couples who love each other to enjoy the legal benefits of a married status WITHOUT offending the fundamentalist christians who poop themselves at the mention of “same sex marriage”. We can call it “gayrriage” or “civil union” or something, I honestly dont care what the name is, but it should allow the financial, legal, tax, and other priveleges of marriage to gay couples without being named “marriage” in a religiously offensive way. No offense to those who are devoutly religious, as faith is an extremely respectable thing. However, it is innapropriate to hijack the legal system to serve the “moral ends” of one particular religion. It is also unfair to disallow the aforementioned benefits (which are of a legal nature) to gay couples on religious grounds (which are not of a legal nature). Anyone catch my drift? Gay marriage won’t end the world or corrupt our society, and it doesn’t even have to be called gay marriage…. I don’t care if it’s called a “happy pony land ceremony” instead of a “wedding”, as long as the gay couple is allowed to legally act with the unity provided to married couples, our society will be treating its gay citizens more fairly.
