In my personal opinion, I do not feel that the Catholic Church needs to allow women to become priests.  There is already a shortage of women who want to become nuns, and I don’t really think that THAT many more women would enter the religious life if they could become priests.  (If a woman REALLY feels called to serve the Catholic Church, then she will likely become a nun.  I don’t know how many women are so deterred from the religious life just because they can’t be priests.)   
I do, however, believe that priests should be allowed to marry.  As stated in previous posts, this has worked for other Protestant religions.  As I understand it, the reasons that the Catholic Church has for requiring celibacy is two-fold.  1.) Jesus was not married, so priests should not be either and 2.)  Having a wife and family could detract from priestly duties.   I feel that the contrary is actually true:  a priest who is married and has a family would be able to better connect with the church community because he could better relate to the majority of the congregation.  And I don’t think that Protestant ministers are any less devout because they are married.
On the subject of the Catholic Church changing its ways, I feel that they need to be very careful in making those decisions.  The Catholic Church prides itself on being grounded in tradition, so to just change things all around would take away from this.  On the other hand, I believe that there are certain changes that DO need to be made.  The Church has gone through all sorts of changes over the ages.  There have been different councils and meetings where the leaders of the church have decided on certain “laws.”  Since the traditions of the church are essentially man-made, I believe that, within certain reasons, there is need for change.  (Since the laws were originally made by humans, I feel that if it will help the Church keep its numbers up, some changes can be made to adapt to current society.)
