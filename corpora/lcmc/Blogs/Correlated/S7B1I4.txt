First of… who in the world declared this as a war!!! Bush is using the war in iraq as a way to benefit himself. Imagine if even after he has left office Iraq is on the way to becoming a democratic country! He would have full bragging rights in saying that he started it, and it was in his doing that and “declaring” the war on terror and bringing Iraq into the picture that they are a democratic state. And also America being the selfish place that it is, wants to democratize Iraq so as to keep their source of oil within their reach.
 
“Bush supporters say its better to fight terrorists in Iraq than in the USA,” wow this statement took me by surprise. I suspect that if these people support Bush then they are supporting his idea of democratizing Iraq and building a new country. So has does that happen with continued fighting in Iraq? Granted most of the fighting is only taking place in a few areas and isn’t as countrywide as the media leads us all to believe but still how can a country grow if its getting constantly setback by bombings.
 
Wow!! Gobigdonny has but everything that I would feel about the war if I actually knew a sufficient amount of information into my own words. I was one of those people who after 9/11 was so exited to go over to Iraq and whop some Iraqi ass but that’s all I  knew about the war. And that’s what the government fed off of when 9/11, they thought we normally might not have everyone’s support but because people are angry we will definitely have it now to go over to Iraq and basically tear down all their establishments and start over. So they can build a little “America” in Iraq.
