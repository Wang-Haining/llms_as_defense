            The Iraq “war”.  It’s a touchy subject for most people, especially kids our age.  Most of the soldiers in Iraq are not much older than us, but hey, they’re fighting for what they believe in, there hasn’t been a draft. We went in for the wrong reasons, yeah, we should have just gone in saying we were going after Sadaam, hell, we’ve had the ability and the permission to do that for years. What I don’t get is people saying we should just pull all of our soldiers out of Iraq.  Drives me crazy.  There’s a reason that we went there, and we need to help the people there, there’s no one else to help.  This isn’t some political ploy to keep Bush in office or to make him look better.  Honestly, when people say stuff like that it scares me.  First of all, no one would use others lives just to get themselves ahead, it’s a ridiculous notion.  Secondly, how in the HELL would this help?
            Yeah, sure, after 9/11 people were screaming for us to go to war.  So we went.  Those same people are screaming for us to pull out and leave these people defenseless and without a government. This isn’t the war on terror anymore; we’re aiming to help people.  We’ve gotten rid of the terror.  Then people say, “Oh at least under Sadaam there was order”.  Yeah, an order maintained by murder, how is that good in any way shape or form?  Contrary to the belief being spewed from our media these days, we aren’t trying to make a “little America”, we’re trying to make a better place for everyone to live.  We wouldn’t try to make a “little America” It’s not going to work anywhere but here.  The culture is too different.  Why shouldn’t we try to help those who need it?  No one else will.
