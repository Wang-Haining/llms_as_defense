Personally, I don’t believe this country should legalize marijuana because promoting a drug, and I feel that’s wrong and as a bio major it isn’t healthy. However, marijuana should be legalized for health purposes; if it will help prevent a disease or help someone cope with a disease they already have then I am not for seeing anyone go through unnecessary pain.  However, with many new phenomena there are both good sides and bad sides to the issue. On the negative side, I don’t believe the country should legalize and have it at local drug stores because of the potential risk of addiction and distribution it should be stored at hospitals or at places where an authoritative signature or later is needed in order to gain access to it.
From what I’ve heard on commercials and from friends, those who are high on marijuana usually just waste their life because they smoke and sit in the same spot for hours. So it may affect someone for a few hours but they usually don’t move and even when they are driving they are moving really slow even though their hearts maybe doing something different. And according to the reading, it has the same long tern affects that a cigarette has, and that’s legal so then if in the long run they have the same affects why can’t it be legalized? I do agree with GOBIGDONNY in that our country is definitely not in a position to deal with the affects of legalizing marijuana. We have more problems such as gay marriage and the war in Iraq and the problems with the Catholic church to worry about legalization right now. And who knows this may just be a fad, in a couple years the hype of smuggling and selling marijuana may go down and we would have went through the trouble of legalizing it for no reason.
