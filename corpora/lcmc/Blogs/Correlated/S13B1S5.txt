While I do feel that gender discrimination still exists in certain areas of today’s society, I think that we have definitely come a long way towards improving things.  In terms of the “feminism” movement, personally I agree with the fact that this movement made more sense a few decades ago.  It used to be that it was assumed that women would just stay home and be housewives, taking care of the children.  Now that most women are just as likely as men to pursue higher education, I feel that there is not much of a need in society for this sort of a feminist movement.  For those people who feel that men and women need to be equal in ALL regards, I disagree.  Men and women are physically different, and as a result, there are certain instances where men are just better suited for the task at hand.  For example, while some women might be up for (and perfectly capable of) being in the police force or soldiers in the armed forces, in most cases, men are better suited for these jobs. 
Regarding the corporate and academic worlds, I believe that women and men are equal in terms of their capabilities.  There is no reason why women should receive different salaries than men for performing the exact same duties.  While I think that men and women are able to perform at equal levels in the business world, I also believe that because of the discrimination that some women face, this can impact their ability to advance in their fields.  What I mean to say is that if there are certain male coworkers who look down upon the abilities of female employees, this could potentially impact the ability of the female to perform her duties to the utmost.  An example of this could be if managers see that the female employee does not have the respect of her male coworkers, these bosses might be less likely to promote the female to a management position, even though she has the necessary skills.
