Is there really a reason to refuse marriage to gay couples? I can’t see one.  Most homosexual couples aren’t asking for a religious marriage, they are asking for the legalities allowed to heterosexual couples.  As it stands now, people in a homosexual relationship can’t share in a partner’s benefits from work, and have no claim to their partner should something terrible happen.  Sometimes it even seems like by denying even a civil union to homosexual couples we are undermining their very existence.  It seems like we are saying they don’t deserve the right to the same type of life as heterosexual couples.  Another argument used against homosexual “marriage” is that they can’t have children.  Well if that’s the argument, should we allow those couples that don’t plan on having children to marry?  And for that matter, heterosexual couples that cannot have children should not be allowed the status of marriage.  When we discriminate against one group we end up discriminating against everyone.  Personally I think the argument over this “issue” is ridiculous.  Homosexuals aren’t different from anyone else, so why should there be laws saying what they can and cannot do.  Sometimes I feel like the laws are being made to shut up those few people who disagree with a lifestyle choice.  The people who have no problem with homosexual couples aren’t going to make a ruckus, so they aren’t heard, they are drowned out by the yelling of a relative few.  No one should be punished for living their life the way that makes them happy.  Denying gay couples the right to a union is denying them happiness, and that is denying the very basis of what our country was built on.  Our forefathers may have been puritans but they left an oppressive government for freedom, freedom for everyone.  Not just whites, not just Christians, not just heterosexuals, everyone.
