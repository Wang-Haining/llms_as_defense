Talking about a national ID system addresses a very tricky subject.  While it could certainly help the government in monitoring for terrorism, it does raise issues of privacy.  Personally, I very much agree with many of the ideas brought up by littlestanemone.  I feel that, as least from my perspective, I am willing to give up some privacy in order to prevent possible future acts of terrorism.  I have nothing to hide from the government, and therefore don’t really mind if someone happens to listen in to a phone conversation, etc.  To me, this partial loss of privacy seems like a small price to pay if, in the long run, doing so could help save the lives of others.  
            On the other hand, the reality is that the government will not likely be listening to my conversations, as I don’t really fall into a target suspect group.  So although I state that I would give up some privacy, more likely than not, this phone tapping, etc. would not affect me much.  It would, however, affect minority groups, especially those of Middle Eastern descent and thus we have the issue of racial profiling and discrimination.  We have already seen this to be somewhat of a problem with The Patriot Act, with innocent people being investigated and sometimes falsely accused, just because of stereotypes.  
            This said, I still am in support of a national ID system.  Although it might cause some inconvenience at times, I believe that it could help to better control who enters and leaves our country, as well as help in monitoring people once they are inside the borders.  I do, however, believe that the government will need to use extreme discretion in releasing any information obtained through this system.  It is very important that only necessary government officials have access to this information and that it be used only in an appropriate context of protecting our nation.
