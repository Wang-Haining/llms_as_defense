Homosexuality is a lifestyle that is up and coming in our society today. People, especially in areas such as New York City, are used to seeing same sex couples walking around, kissing, holding hands, and hugging. For some, these kinds of acts are viewed as unholy, not right, weird, gross, and just not the norm. Others, however, see no problem with how homosexuals act in public, they believe that it is their choice, their life. For me, I am in the middle on this issue. I do believe that it is their choice and their life to do what they want, however, I am not keen on even having heterosexual couples displaying their affection for each other in public. I just think it makes everyone else around them uncomfortable. I think this issue of same sex couples is one that is like gender issues, as time passes, it will become more normal and more accepted. We cannot expect our society that has been viewing heterosexual couples as the norm for thousands of years to just change. Because I went to Catholic school for most of my life, I have seen many people disapprove of this behavior. I know that this is the church’s view on the issue of homosexuality, however, the church does not have the last word in every issue. It does not always have to make the final judgment on what is right and what is wrong. However, when speaking about gay marriage, I believe that the church’s opinion does matter. Marriage is a sacred sacrament that has been in the Catholic religion since the beginning. If gay couples want to be recognized as a couple by the state, that is fine. However, they have to realize that they will never be recognized by the church as a couple because homosexuality is against Catholic beliefs. They cannot expect the church to change it’s views on this issue so drastically. Over time, I think, the Church might warm up to the idea because it will become such a norm ion society, but that will not be for a long while.
