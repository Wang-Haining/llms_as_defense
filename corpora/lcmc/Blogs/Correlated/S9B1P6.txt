I’d like to know what the Europeans think.  It seems that there is a balance in each continent.  The discussion starter tells us that here in the United States, we don’t have a national ID system as they do in Europe.  But in the U.S. companies are allowed to gain access to any kind of personal information concerning employees that they can get their hands on, while in Europe such practices are much more strictly regulated.
 
            I think that in the U.S., privacy rights are too often abused by the government, especially by such measures as the Patriot Act, passed and signed into law in October of 2001, which allowed government access to individual medical records, tax records, student records, etc., and expanded the ability of law enforcement to conduct secret searches.  That scares me. (I think Ben Franklin might be horrified too if he were still around)
            To the best of my knowledge, when one applies for a job, he/she must inform the potential employer of any health problems that the applicant actually has – heart problems, some sort of disease, etc. – not what potentially could be wrong with him/her how every many years down the road.  I do not believe that employers or insurance companies should have access to individual genetic information.  There are certain genes that increase the likelihood of getting cancer and other diseases.  When health insurance agencies get a hold of tests that reveal such mutations, they turn down people who might never even get cancer.  But more importantly, if they turn down someone who does eventually get cancer, that poor individual will lack the health care coverage necessary to pay for exorbitant costs of treatment.  Knowing this, some people may decline to participate in genetic testing, and miss the opportunity to catch the disease before it even starts.
