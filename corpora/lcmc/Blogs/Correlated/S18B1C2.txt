as a roman catholic, the updating of the catholic church is an issue that hits close to home.  while i don’t plan on becoming a priest, it is obvious that the matters mentioned concerning the eligibility and conditions of the priesthood have consequences to any Catholic, as Boston unfortunately found out in the awful way it did.
first off, i don’t see anything wrong with letting priests marry or allowing women to become priests.  the reasons given below my post are at least on the right track; if not i agree with them completely.  the idea of the priest being “married to church” and therefore not allowed to have a wife has become viewed as antiquated and (despite many centuries of priests being able to conduct their duties fine celibate) the more i truly think about the argument, the more i agree with the reformers. allowing women to become priests just makes sense: the gender issue is definately outdated and in the (relatively) equal society between men and women we live in today there is no legitimate reason to keep a woman from joining the priesthood.
assuming that the church eventually does update itself on these two matters, it would be interesting to speculate what order it does update.  based on my understanding, i would assume woman priests would be admitted before any priest was allowed to marry: even a celibate woman priest would still be “married to the church”.
finally, i think that the ending points of the starter post are very relevent and well put.  any time an influential institution that people base their beliefs off like the Church changes its doctrines, the change needs to be well thought out.  the institution does not even need to be religious; we can see similar parrellels with the controversy of president bush attempting to amend the constitution on the issue of gay marriage.
