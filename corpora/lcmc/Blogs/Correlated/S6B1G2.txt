I’m definitely with Mtnbike9 on this one. I’ve never heard anyone make a reasonable, articulate argument for why gay marriage should be banned. Most arguments against it I’ve heard refer to marriage as a “sacred institution.” Well, if you go to a church and get married, then it’s certainly a sacred institution for you. But the fact of the matter is that sacraments are not a concern of the federal or the state governments. When a state issues a marriage license, it’s called a license for a reason. It’s a document with legal ramifications recognizing a special relationship between the two individuals involved. Denying gays marriage licenses is silly; it would be like refusing to grant forklift operator licenses to left-handed people.
Churches are free to make whatever rules they want about who can get married in their churches. That’s their right. Their decisions and beliefs have no proper bearing on the law, though. Like it or not, we don’t live in a theocracy, and ideas about holy writ don’t hold up in court as rationalizations for stupid laws (or attempted constitutional amendments).
The fact that portions of the Republican Party (coughBushcough) would waste time clamoring for a ban on gay marriage demonstrates a gross misplacement of values. It looks like they’ve tabled that idea for the time being, and I’m glad (there happens to be an important geographic region of the Middle East that’s badly in need of a plan for stabilizing it. Somehow, this strikes me as being more important than stopping the government from issuing legalistic little pieces of paper to specific couples).
Also, the argument that heterosexual procreation provides the building blocks of civilization is not only dated, but unwieldy in a world that’s quickly becoming overpopulated. The government has absolutely no control of who has sex with whomever else, and any argument based on the idea that marriage licenses are somehow dispensed as have-legit-sex cards is laughable.
