Gender discrimination has become one of the most troubling issues of the 19th and 20th centuries. In America, we have come far in many ways to lessen the tension between the two sexes. In other countries, the gap between men and women is much wider. This is based upon social ideals and traditions in these cultures.
The feminists of our time, although not battling the same issues as those who came before them, are fighting very important battles. In some workplaces, women are still not shown the same respect as their male coworkers. The equal pay for equal jobs idea is not always followed, especially in some high level jobs. Women are also currently fighting over the idea of abortion. There are groups of women who believe that they should have the right to decide, pro-choice, for whether or not they would like an abortion. These women believe that it should not be up to the government to make decisions about their bodies.
This discrimination is not just limited to women. The stay at home men of our time are becoming more and more prevalent in society. These men, often referred to as “Mr. Mom” are the stay at home “mothers” of the 21st century. No longer is it seen as ridiculous for a woman to be the one to go off to work. Also, men are discriminated against in the way that they look at women. Often, as a group, being called “sexist” or “pigs” men seem to be accused of many faults towards women in general.
In many aspects of life, gender discrimination has come very far within the last century. It is no longer seen as absurd that a woman can vote, or hold a job. Although there are still some areas to be conquered, and we could never change the personal views of every person, Americans have come very far in closing the gap between genders.
