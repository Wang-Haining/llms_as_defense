hoopdreams, your blog entry baffles me. although you do make some amazingly intellectual statements (such as pointing out that World War II was justified) and a nice history lesson about the real truth of how saddam hussien came to power (or, as you quipped, “our little Seddam”. like, LoL!!1!!), there is a blanket statement that just doesn’t coincide with the rest of your entry.  Now, its easy to see you’re taking every precaution to let the interweb know you are an smart, educated person with “liberal political ideologies” that is good at writing hip blog entries, but you let your guard down when you posted this:
“…I would have been in agreement with any military assistance we could have provided during the Rwandan genocide that the Caucasian world never lost sleep over.”
now, i understand that sometimes these blog entries get a little tedious, and everyone is tempted to (if they don’t already) just type down the first 300 words that they can think of on the given topic.  but thinking that every single white person didn’t care about something as horrific as the Rwandan genocide? thats using the same logic that people do when they say all black people are good at basketball. its not the meaning of what you wrote that annoyed/offended me - i’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you meant something else - but how unintelligent of a statement it is in a blog entry full of intellectual quips. i would continue , but im not trying to sound intelligent, just prove a simple point. plus, arguing online is best summed up by this: http://cache.bordom.net/images/ba1c8cf1553955352def95c659544c9d.png
oh, and just for the record, the iraq war sucks - but everybody knows that.  even the people without “liberal political ideologies” who want to stay believe that its being run poorly right now.
