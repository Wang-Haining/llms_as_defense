Obviously this one of the biggest stories, if not the biggest story in the media today. Almost everyday we hear about new deaths in Iraq and we hear stories about how they are trying to set up a stable government. One question on most people’s minds is, “how much longer?” This “war on terror” is only generating more anti-American sentiments throughout the Middle East. “What have we solved?”
In my own opinion I feel that the war has gone on long enough. I did not agree with the original reasons for them to go into Iraq and I wholy resent the way that the war has gone. There were no weapons of mass destruction there. Wasn’t the original quarrel with Al Queda in Afghanistan? If anything, we only created more problems than we solved. While it is nice to have a terrible dictator out of power, there is still the fact that we have left their country in a chaotic state which I think very few would actually want to live in. Any thought that we could possibly set up a stable government with Iraq in this state is insane.
Though I do feel that the war has gone on for too long, I do not think that we should pull out. We have caused a great deal of destruction and are obligated to fix what we’ve broken and get the people there back on their feet. Pulling out now would just send the two opposing sides (Suni and Shitte) into civil war. It could even turn out to be another Rwanda. In order to make any progress at all we first need to seek some sort of agreement between both the groups. Once we find that it will be much more plausable that we can set up a free government for the people there. However, when doing this we will also have to take into consideration the will of the people and the subjects that they are sensitive too (such as religion).
