Legalizing marijuana? Why not? There are no known hazards to your health. Cigarettes, from what I know, pose more danger to people in society then marijuana will ever pose. I have many friends that smoke marijuana and it has not effected their academic performance, social life, or home life. the only thing it has effected greatly is their financial status! Most of them say that they can stop anytime, they do not feel that marijuana is addictive. They also find it to be relaxing. They like to unwind after a hard day at school, or just to casually smoke with friends ( like you would casually have a beer after a hard day). Some even find that smoking marijuana now and then enhances their academic performance. Because marijuana relaxes them, they find that they are able to rid themselves of anxiety over stressful situations and tests and are able to recall facts easier. From what I have heard, marijuana seems less harmful then alcohol and cigarettes. However, too much of anything is not good, and there is no way that the government could possibly keep track of how much marijuana each person has at one time, just like alcohol and cigarettes, it is a matter of personal preference and choice. Because marijuana smoke can be very disgusting to some just like cigarette smoke, I do not think it should be legal for people to be able to smoke in public. Personally, I do not enjoy marijuana smoke and I have never tried it and never will. I have always been against any kind of smoking. However, from what I here, it does not seem to be as harmful as some people make it out to be. I think by legalizing it, the government will have less problems. Kids will not have to go to dangerous dealers or dangerous places to get marijuana, they will be able to go to a safe store. The government has to weight the pros and cons of this decision very wisely.
