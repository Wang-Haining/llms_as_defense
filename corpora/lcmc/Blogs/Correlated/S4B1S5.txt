I think gender discrimination in the U.S. today is blown way out of proportion.  For the most part, employers today can’t afford to discriminate based on sex.  It is economically unwise.  For example, if an employer decides not to hire a woman with a skill set equal to or better than a man, a competitor can snatch her up.  The first employer loses out.  He/she is left with an inferior employee, while his/her competitor gets the better one.  Businesses today are only concerned with results.  There will always be bigots in this world who will discriminate, but that is just the nature of humanity.  U.S. society as a whole, however, does not discriminate based on gender.
It is up to the individual to make his or her place in the world.  There have been many instances in which a woman was not hired because the employer felt that she was not as qualified as someone else.  And if that someone else happens to be a man, it may seem like gender discrimination.  I feel like many cases of gender discrimination are just cases of coincidence.  There really is no way to prove that gender discrimination was the deciding factor if a woman isn’t hired.  Unless there is an undeniable trend, its hard to prove anything.
I think the feminist movement had its place in the 1960’s when it was clear that women were not equal to men in society.  Today, however, women are equal to men.  If a woman wants to get an education and succeed, the only thing that can stop her is herself.  A good portion of the feminist movement today sees men as the enemy.  This is simply not the case.  Sure, there will always be those who discriminate against women.  There is no way to change some people.  Society (in the U.S. at least) is changed.  People are accepting of those who are different from them.
