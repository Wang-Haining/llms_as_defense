The war in Iraq has become one of the most talked about issues in our world today. The “war on terror” has been criticized as having gone on too long. Many Americans think that we have lost our focus overseas and could be focusing on conflicts that are more of a threat to our safety.
We have been over in Iraq for over four years now. I don’t believe that it would be beneficial to the United States to completely remove ourselves at this point in time. We are staying in Iraq to help them establish a democracy, but is democracy a far-fetched goal? We have eliminated Saddam Hussein’s power over the Iraqi people, but how do we know when we have helped enough?
With a change of President in our immediate future any drastic movement in Iraq would not be smart. Furthermore, it is easier for us to make judgments because we do not know all of the information about what is going on in Iraq. There are large numbers of American troops currently in Iraq and I think that it is time for them to start to come home. I believe that Iraq still needs governmental guidance, but maybe we could do so without keeping all of our troops there. Every day there are innocent people dying, but do these soldiers even know exactly what they are fighting for?
Leaving now would leave the people with no hope. We will have successfully freed them from their oppressor, but we have not established a strong government to take control. Although we have done much in ways to help their freedom, there is still much more that can be done. Its just a matter of how much longer this will go on, and how many more lives will “need” to be taken.
