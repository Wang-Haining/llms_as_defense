Personally, I am opposed to the legalization of marijuana.  I don’t really have a strong argument to defend my position, but basically, I don’t feel that the government should make it easier for its citizens to use drugs.  I understand that marijuana is not addictive and it has not been proven to have the same sort of long term effects as other drugs, but it is still a substance which impairs the body and can be abused. 
We already have problems with drunk driving, so I don’t feel that we should legalize another substance which could cause impairments that would lead to accidents on the road.  I know that people are going to do what they want to regardless of whether or not marijuana is legalized, and that there already are people driving high, but I don’t think that we should help increase this number by legalizing marijuana.
I feel that right now, many people who smoke marijuana do it for the “thrill” of using an illegal substance, but since it is not addictive, this does not prove to be that harmful.  However, if marijuana were to be legalized, this thrill would be gone.  I believe that some people would then no longer be satisfied using only marijuana, and therefore would look to try some other drug (which would likely be more harmful).  I am not necessarily citing marijuana as a current “gateway” drug but I think that if it were legal, some people who previously only smoked marijuana (and used no other drugs) would take things a step further and try something else.  
On the other hand, I believe that the discussion starter brought up a very valid point about the economic ramifications of the sale of marijuana.  As I stated previously, people are going to smoke marijuana regardless of whether or not it is legal.  If it were legal, the industry would be under some sort of govermment control, instead of being underground.  This newly legal industry could provide many job opportunities, and the profits from sales would also then be counted in the US GDP.
