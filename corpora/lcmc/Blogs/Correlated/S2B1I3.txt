When the Iraq War first began, I supported our stance in the conflict and truly believed that we had just cause to take action.  Saddam Hussein was a known evil dictator who used violence to cause fear and hold control over an entire people.  There was also the chance that Hussein was concealing weapons of mass destruction somewhere in the country.  What chance that was, we will never know.  And that is the question that matters, only because we did not find any WMDs.  The media has criticized the President for this decision after no WMDs, but I think the criticism is unfounded for several reasons. First, no one knows what intelligence the President had regarding WMDs in Iraq.  Perhaps he had gotten a strong piece of intel from a very trustworthy source that happened to be proven untrue.  Until we know what information he accessed to make his decision, we can not criticize.  Second, Hussein, with his fearsome army that still fights us toe to toe each day, must have owned thousands of different weapons depots located throughout Iraq.  If there was WMDs in Iraq before the war, Hussein could have easily given the order to have them moved out of the country or disassembled a second after being notified of our imminent invasion on CNN.  Even after we first invaded, there was not nearly enough man power to search each and every depot in Iraq.  Even now, they may not have searched every one.  And all this time, a WMD could have been snuck out while the war went on.  Third, Saddam Hussein is evil!  His removal from power is a great gift bestowed upon the world by the United States.  To make a stretch of a comparison, Iraq is not unlike Somalia!  In both cases, an evil force bent on greed was committing the crime of genecide and would have continued if no one stepped in.
