I think that smoking marijuana is a dirty habit and I do not partake in any form of smoking. So, I do not care whether it is legalized or not, but I can understand individuals concerns with the effects of smoking on a person’s health. The effects from smoking listed do not seem as severe, but more bearable then anything. People who smoke marijuana crave more food and sometimes get dry mouth. There do not seem to be SERIOUS health effects. I feel that alcohol has more harmful side effects in long and short terms then marijuana. When people get high they usually do not hurt themselves or endanger others. While alcohol, on the other hand, makes individuals feel invincible, and easily persuaded to do things they would not usually have done. This discussion starter has made me wonder why alcohol is legal but marijuana is not- it seems that marijuana should be the legal substance.
            Another good point the discussion starter made was about the revenue that could be made from the legal sale of marijuana. I would much more prefer to see the money here then in the underground markets. Also, if marijuana were legalized, maybe young people would not abuse it as often. It seems that there are more adults who use it sparingly, rather then abusing it. For example, my friend smoked for the first time with her mother a few weekends ago. Her mom wanted to experience this with her, so she did not think it was something “unaccepted” but to use it for what it is and not abuse it. I think the thrill was taken out of smoking marijuana when my friends’ mother joined her.
            If there was ever a bill passed to legalize marijuana or if I had to vote someone in office to legalize marijuana, I still probably would not. There are valid points to legalize marijuana, but I do not do it and I would prefer if it remained illegal.
