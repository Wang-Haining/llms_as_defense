GROUP1234
MARIJUANA
[The city of Denver has decided to legalize small amounts of marijuana for persons over 21, how do you guys feel about that?]
[S4] I think marijuana can’t be classified with like other drugs like cocaine and heroin cause /first of all, it’s not addictive as far as I know and the effects aren’t nearly as bad, so I don’t see any reasons why it can’t be legalized.
[S3] And it’s not synthetically laced as cocaine
[S2] One main issue I have is /um / how alcohol and cigarettes are both legal and they both have their /you know /positives and negatives /so I mean /uh /I don’t see a big difference between that and marijuana /both of those
[S3] And the long-term effects of drinking are much more severe
[S2] Yeah
[S3] Than um 
[S2] Alcoholism and liver
[S3] Yeah, it’s known to destroy families /um /you know /people have killed people under extreme influence /people do /you know
[S1] I mean drunk driving, one /you know right on top
[S3] Yeah, how many murders have been caused by /you know /the dealing of drugs /but, that’s a reason why legalizing it might cut down on that sort of violence /you know maybe drugs could be handled in a /um /you know there wouldn’t be so many deaths caused on the streets because of it
[S2] I think they need to like /like get and exact definition of what a drug is because /I mean just like you said /grouping marijuana with all those other physically addictive
[S1] Like LSD /like /[laughter] /not the same kind of thing
[S2] Yeah, like hallucinogens like that /I mean it just seems /I don’t know /not smart
[S4] I mean, there are good drugs too. The majority of drugs are used for medicinal purposes. I work in a hospital pharmacy, and we’ve got narcotics /you know /that are illegal in the street /but, they’re legal for medicinal /and so marijuana does have medicinal properties /so I /it’s stupid not to utilize that
[S1] I mean definitely for medical use /like if it can help you, why not? If it’s something that 
[S2] Would you think that they should legalize it or just leave it for the medicinal purposes?
[S4] I think marijuana should be legalized for general purposes.
[S3] Definitely medicinal though.
[S1] Yeah, definitely.
[S3] One hundred percent
[S1] Oh, yeah, definitely medicinal
[S4] I think there’s like a /there’s like a stigma around marijuana that like the government created /you know /Ronald Reagan’s war on drugs /and uh /we were all told never to use drugs /that they /in reality, it’s not that bad
[S1] A lot of people /a lot of arguments that I’ve heard against like /the basic arguments were like oh it’s a gateway drug, it’s a gateway drug /but like so is alcohol /you know /even cigarettes like can get you started on something
[S2] When you say it’s a gateway drug /like you think of it like a physical /like you move on
[S1] Like you have to do something else.
[S2] But, I mean it’s psychological /like it’s just like anything else /it’s up to the person /you know? It’s only a gateway drug /I don’t know /I only think of it as meaning a gateway drug as meaning you do that /like you do marijuana and then you see it’s not that bad /and then you wanna move on to other things just to like /I don’t know have more fun or whatever
[S1] I think that people are going to do that whether it’s legal or illegal, so /like the people who feel like they need to move onto something bigger and better /for actual marijuana to legalize /I don’t know if that would change a lot
[S3] If marijuana didn’t exist at all /people would still /with cocaine and you know heroin
[S1] No, people would still be doing drugs.
[S3] People would still be doing drugs, so I /you know the people that make the choices /there are numerous /there are unbelievable amounts of people who have tried marijuana /even done it throughout college /throughout their lives and have never touched anything else /I can’t tell you how many countless friends I have that have /you know /tried marijuana /that’s you know /they do it on a regular basis /and would not come in the same room as cocaine or heroin /any of those things /would not come near it /you know? /so I don’t really think it’s like you try it and then the next step is this, and you know getting into weed that you’re going to be eventually going into heroin at all
[S1] Yeah, it’s not like that’s the next step you have to take.
[S3] It’s not a promise gateway drug. It’s a person’s choice to make it a gateway drug /I think /and I always felt even when I learned about it and /you know when you’re younger and you have to take that course in school that says drugs is bad as the name of the chapter /I just felt like /you know when it listed the other things I was like this stuff was really bad, but with marijuana /always kind of seemed like bull crap to /you know /it makes you not think so smart /like, really? /just didn’t seem as troubling
[S1] I mean, on the scale of drugs, marijuana is definitely like the baby /you know /like on the whole
[S3] Right, and its effects are long-term /are very similar to that of cigarettes /you know the
[S1] Lung cancer or
[S3] Right, I mean you run a lot of risks, and /you know /but, if we had the choice to smoke cigarettes /why do we not have that same choice to smoke marijuana?
[S2] Cigarettes to me are a lot more like disgusting to just think of /I mean I don’t know everything that’s in a cigarette
[S3] Oh my God.
[S1] Tar
[S2] I mean just tons of things that are in there. I mean marijuana /that’s a plant that comes out of the ground /that’s it /you know
[S4] Plus, cigarettes are addictive /and that’s /that’s what
[S2] Physically addictive, yeah
[S3] And they have /you know /tar /I mean so many carcinogens
[S1] I mean all those Truth commercials /it’s just really /when you learn what’s in a cigarette /it’s basically just all disgusting things you’d never want to put in your body rolled up into a nice little thing you can smoke
[S3] Right, and that’s allowed at 18, not even 21 /so
[S1] Some states are making it 19 /ooo /that whole year /[laughter]
[S2] It’s funny though like how much more solid the information is /that they have against cigarettes is /in the Truth commercials it’s all facts and everything /but, then if you see the Truth commercials about marijuana/ they have like that /that campaign now with 
[S3] With the deflated kid
[S2] Yeah, they have that. They have the cartoon guy that doesn’t want to walk his cartoon dog for some reason.
[Laughter]
[S3] Yeah, cause he’s just so lazy. Like /I mean and the same rules apply /you don’t go to work drunk /you can’t go to work high, and that applies whether it’s legal or illegal /you don’t do it
[S1] And /um /a couple of arguments that have come up in either the chat or things that I’ve read about /um /about um legalization of marijuana /one person had said that well if it became legal, wouldn’t a lot more people do it? /and now, I’m sure there’s a couple of people out there who have said, no, not until it’s legal /you know /but really /like now /it’s really prevalent /like you said /there’s so many people who have at least tried it /and that /at that rate of being able to obtain it /if it’s that easy to get now when it’s illegal /how like /making it legal /if you’re not gonna smoke, you’re not gonna smoke /it’s the same reason /cigarettes are legal and I don’t smoke cigarettes /you can’t make it more legal /like I’m still not gonna smoke them /it’s that kind of thing /if you’re gonna smoke, you’re gonna smoke /I don’t know if necessarily 
[S2] Make them more legal? 
[Laughter]
[S1] I don’t know /like you know? /anything like /and it’s the same kind of thing /there’s people out there who will smoke whether its legal or not /I mean right now like you said it’s illegal and how many people do we know that do it? /and then so make it legal /and there’s very few people I feel /who oh now that it’s legal /sure I’ll try it /ya know there’s /I mean /cause when you put it that way alcohol’s illegal if you’re under 21, and how many people are like, ooo not this weekend? /like you know
[S2] What’s interesting /I don’t know if this like came up in your chat groups or whatever /um, but it came up in mine /how if they made it legal /I thought that there might be a big decrease in like teenagers using it because it loses that like thrill factor of you know doing something illegal and going against the
[S3] Absolutely
[S1] Yeah, but I think the user /well the people who are using it or the people that have been doing it /whatever you know every once in a while I don’t know if it’d be such a big change when all of a sudden it’s legal /you know all of a sudden it’s easier to get /right, if you were doing it anyway /it’s easier for you to get
[S2] Yeah /I mean it’s so widespread /it just like why not make it legal because you can avoid all those /like you know if there’s like some marijuana like drug dealing /people get shot because of it /if you can avoid that /like why /I mean like you said it’s really not /its really not gonna change the crowd of people who do it
[S1] Right, right
[S2] If you go from illegal to legal
[S4] You look at a place like Amsterdam where it is legal
[S2] There’s no crime.
[S4] Right /it works there so why wouldn’t it work here? It’s not like people running crazy in the streets.
[S1] And like we said, the same rules would apply /like you’re not allowed to drink when you drive /you’re not allowed to smoke when you drive /you know it would all go the same way /don’t go to work drunk /don’t go to work high /one of the arguments was, well its harder to tell if you’re high than if you’re drunk /yes, but at the same time don’t go to work high /[laughter] /you know what I mean like it might be a little harder to catch, but does that mean you’re gonna
[S3] It’s hard /people who are true alcoholics 
[S1] Drink on the job /yeah
[S3] Drink /I mean it’s the truth /I mean
[S2] Well they’re depending on the [inaudible]
[S3] Right, I mean 
[S1] I mean there are ways to hide anything /I mean /you know /like you said there are people who 
[S3] My /for example, my grandfather was an alcoholic /my Dad said it was weird when he was sober /he said one of the times in his life was my aunt’s wedding and it was weird because he didn’t drink that day because he didn’t think he was supposed to and he acted weird /you know /wasn’t him
[S1] Right, so you may see someone every day at your job and be like, oh /you know /there she is /she might be drunk every day and you might not notice /it’s the same kind of thing again of people who smoke on the weekends or smoke at night /whatever /if they’re not doing it now during the day /what’s gonna make them all of a sudden /oh, it’s legal let me smoke during work
[S3] Because it’s available to them now.
[S1] Right, that’s the kind of thing too /and it’s the same with alcohol /even with people over 21 /not even talking about underage drinking /over 21 people go out after work /have a drink /drink on the weekends /doesn’t necessarily mean they’re drinking during the say /they don’t have a flask in their desk /[laughter] /I mean it doesn’t necessarily lead to all of a sudden people are drinking at work /all of a sudden people are smoking at work
[S2] Yeah, I think that the people that actually change are the people that don’t do it solely because it’s illegal.
[S1] An, again, how much of the population could that be? Cause even now /solely because it’s illegal /although I have /I feel that especially /and I know we’re going back and forth from alcohol and marijuana, but even with alcohol /how many people do you think on a given weekend who aren’t drinking /their reason is I don’t think I can get any? /you there’s always seems to be a way to get /and the same thing with marijuana /it’s prevalent enough that like finding it wouldn’t necessarily be your problem
[S4] And the people who don’t drink /just I think it’s more of a moral thing
[S1] Right, that’s what I’m trying to say. It’s never /it’s almost never oh I really would drink, but I can’t get any tonight.
[S4] Or it’s illegal sometimes.
[S1] Or it’s illegal /yeah oh nope not til I’m 21 /there are people who do it /don’t get me wrong /there are /but, I don't know if that would be the top reason /the number one reason why people don’t smoke is because it’s not legal
[S4] And people argue that marijuana smoke is worse than cigarette smoke, but at the same time, you’re not smoking marijuana as much as you’re smoking cigarettes /so
[S2] Yeah
[S1] And that’s almost not possible with all the stuff that’s in cigarettes.
[S4] Yeah, I think I saw that in a commercial.
[S1] I mean I really don’t know the facts either, but just from /cause I never seen the whole /you know /marijuana side of it /but just from all the stuff that’s in cigarettes /like you said /more /how many times do you go into like a restaurant or you just even like on a subway or something /people are just like /everywhere
[S2] That’s true. I think it’s more just like intensity on like your lungs because /I mean obviously marijuana has a much larger, more intense effect than like a cigarette /so just like having one marijuana cigarette is like the same for your lungs as like 5 or whatever it is
[S2] It’s four or five.
[S1] Right, but again if you /like people who will smoke during the day /during like coffee breaks, lunch breaks, before work or school /you know before and after /but then maybe if you /if marijuana was legal /you’d smoke like once a night /or not even that extreme /but, even if it was once a day, and then /but for the ten cigarettes that someone may smoke a day /obviously that’s a little extreme /but, you know if you smoke 
[S3] People do three packs a day.
[S1] No, but /I know I don’t know what like the average a day would be, but if you /you have to consider that too /of how often someone would be smoking marijuana opposed to how often the would be smoking a cigarette
[S3] Right 
[S4] And, if you use anything in excess it’s gonna be bad for you.
[S1] Right, I mean anything /you eat too much candy, it’s not good for ya
[S4] Or if you drink too much water, you can die from that.
[S1] Right, I mean really /anything in excess
[S2] You can?
[S1] Yeah, there was um /there when um /the
[S4] They were given Nintendo Wii
[S1] When the Nintendo Wii came out /um, there was a radio contest that was you had to drink as much water as you possibly could without stopping or without something within a certain amount of time /oh without going to the bathroom in a certain amount of time /and this woman drank so much water, she died /really that she drank /she was rushed to the hospital and died because she drank too much water
[S3] Oh, my gosh.
[S1] Trying to win a Nintendo Wii, by the way, but not even the point. So, I mean even water in excess, and your body’s 98% of it.
[S2] So you think it should be legalized?
[S1] Um /I mean everything in moderation, and really /I mean obviously I don’t know statistics, but of the amount of people who I’m assuming are using it already /what could the change be?
[S3] I believe it’s 40% have either tried it on one occasion or at some point in their life.
[S1] Ok, which I mean 
[S2] That statistic doesn’t really tell a lot /[laughter]
[S1] I mean, but of course /but, and again we’ve kind of discussed too about like people being like oh, it’s legal /all of a sudden, oh sure I’ll smoke /so again of these people who are using it or have used it, what would the big change be by making it legal?
[S3] I think they’ll definitely be more people willing to try it, if it is legal /definitely /I think that there is /there are a lot of people that are skeeved out only because it’s illegal /I do believe that, but I don’t think it’s gonna be something that’s 
[S1] It’s not gonna be all of a sudden 99.9% of the population smokes 3 or more times a day. You know /all of a sudden it’s not gonna be a drastic increase.
[S3] Um /you had said there were three people in your discussion group that were not for it?
[S2] My chat group
[S3] Your chat group /what did they say? I’m interested.
[S2] Um 
[S3] Do you remember?
[S2] Well, they said the gateway drug thing. Um, they also said how it’s worse for you than cigarettes. I think they brought up all the
[S1] Cliché
[S2] One thing I was gonna ask you guys, actually /um /you know how they have decriminalized marijuana in Spain and like some other countries /did you /you didn’t hear that?
[S3] No, I didn’t hear that.
[S2] They decriminalized it, so it’s not a /so smoking marijuana is not a criminal act now /it’s just something that you can be fined for, but it’s not like a felony or anything like that or whatever /um, do you guys
[S1] So you get a ticket for it instead of being thrown into jail?
[S2] Yeah, you get like fined or whatever /and I think you’re allowed to carry like a certain amount on you /like Amsterdam /I’m not sure if you get /but, do you think like if we did that here /do you think that’s enough? /or like do you think it should still be legalized? /like what do you guys think about the whole decriminalization idea?
[S3] I don’t think that’s a bad idea. I mean, if it’s leading to situations where you have a huge house party for marijuana and there’s people /you’re being loud, the same disturbances as involved in alcohol /if you’re having a small get-together just drink alcohol and I mean you don’t get in trouble for that /why can’t you have a small get-together and smoke weed? /[Laughter] /I mean it just doesn’t /you know, but if you’re causing an uproar you should be fined for that /you know /regardless of what the /if you’re causing an uproar completely sober /not drinking /not smoking /you should be fined for that /I mean /right?
[S1] Is it the same as /I’m assuming /I don’t know if you know /but, is it the same as you’re not allowed to drink in public, not allowed to smoke in public kind of thing? /I mean what do we feel about that /like would that
[S3] Oh, I don’t know. 
[S2] I don’t think so. I think they’re saying the act anytime is still fineable.
[S1] Able to fined, but it’s not like you’re a criminal. They just lower the /alright, lower the
[S2] Yeah, so I don’t /ya know you’d be much more willing to like smoke
[S1] If you knew it was a fifty dollar fine instead of five days in jail.
[S2] Yeah, you wouldn’t worry so much about getting caught, and you know
[S1] I mean if they’re not ready to legalize it, I guess /that’s a step in the direction for legalizing it /you know /getting
[S2] I think that’s definitely good /oh, wait /I’m sorry, I just interrupted you /[laughter]
[S1] No, no I was actually done. Go ahead.
[S2] Alright /[laughter] /I wasn’t sure. Um, I think it’s good to decriminalize it because I don’t agree /I mean I don’t know /can you go to jail like just for marijuana?
[S4] I think so, especially on the like second or third offense.
[S2] Really? I mean how can you do that to someone? I mean it’s not like they’re evil for doing it. You know /like
[S4] And I think that people don’t consider the fact that the prison system /it’s way overpopulated
[S2] Yeah
[S4] And a lot of people that are in there /are in there for marijuana charges /they’re just taking up space and taking up money
[S2] That’s ridiculous. That’s such like a huge punishment for a person /I mean /that’s horrible
[S3] For smoking something that’s natural and you know /it’s just /it seems completely
[S2] Yeah, Ok /if they don’t want people do it that’s fine, but it certainly doesn’t warrant prison /to me
[S4] And if you look at other cultures, there’s like some Native Americans /I don’t know /they’ll smoke like mescaline or whatever that is /and it’s not /it’s like a religious thing /it’s not 
[S2] Peace pipe
[S4] Yeah, they don’t see it as bad.
[S2] Yeah
[S1] And, I mean as long as the same rules apply because it still is dangerous to drive when you smoke and drive when you drink /you know as long as rules like that still apply when you’re endangering other people’s lives /like when what you said when you’re just having a house party and being loud /you should still be in trouble for all of that stuff /so, they none of that would change /it doesn’t matter what drug you’re using /well, the legal ones /but, I mean it doesn’t matter what you’re using /you’re still creating a problem with it /you should still be fined or punished for it 
[S3] Umm /we didn’t really talk about medicinal purposes that much /um
[S2] [Inaudible]
[S3] Yes, that too.
[Laughter]
Um, but, ok you can talk now.
[S1] No, but for also, I mean it’s the kind of thing where they’ve shown that in patients that suffer from certain things, that really has helped them /so why not? /it’s gonna help you
[S4] Right /it stimulates appetite for like AIDS patients /I know that /um /and it’s like a pain reducer for cancer patients
[S3] Settles your stomach 
[S1] And all those kinds of things /I really /I totally agree with /for medicinal purposed I totally agree with it /I don’t see anything wrong with that.
[S3] I mean people have to live with /um /terminal diseases
[S1] Right, and if it can ease your pain /you know like those kinds of things /like why not?
[S2] I have /uh /one question /um /do you think legalizing marijuana will lead to questions about legalizing other /more like serious drugs, or?
[S1] I don’t really know. I don’t really think so /just because they are in the /in most cases of them they are such on a different scale of the two drugs /their effects, their addictive capabilities /all those kinds of things /they’re on such a different scale that I don’t know if it’d even become an issue of let’s legalize cocaine or anything like that /they’re much harsher drugs
[S3] Realistically, that could never happen /you know /there’s some drugs you know people do die regularly /you know not regularly /but you know what I mean /from the use of those drugs it’s on a completely different level /and I think that even drug users know that 
[S2] That’s true. I don’t even know if you can die from smoking marijuana.
[S3] Yeah, I don’t know. I’m sure
[S3] Yeah, I’m sure people have died from it.
[S2] It’s probably something they would do under the influence of it.
[S1] I mean I’m sure most deaths are /the same thing with alcohol /a lot of times with alcohol poisoning too, but a lot of times it’s not necessarily the alcohol that kills you /it’s getting into a car when you’re drinking or jumping off something /you know like those kinds of things /or playing with fire or guns
[S3] You hear that so much more often than using marijuana.
[S1] It’s also probably not very well kept track of either, but I agree with you /you hear much more of oh these people were drunk and did this than they smoked and did this /but
[S3] But, it’s interesting because you know that if they’re trying to not legalize it they would make a big deal out of every instance where marijuana led to a death /or you know /led to somebody doing something really stupid /you know what I mean? /you’d think that they would make a big deal out of it /the government would be like this is why /you know? /but the government I think
[S1] No, it’d be good evidence for it.
[S3] Right, I feel like they would put that on the front page and make sure everybody ready it and got a newsletter about it.
[S1] Or like in the last year a hundred people died from /you know what I /like those kinds of things /I mean, I definitely agree that you would think it would be something they definitely use an argument against it
[S3] Yup, but I also think it’s /you know /one of those situations where the government feels like their hands are tied /they’re not gonna do anything about it /you know /it’s
[S4] After all the bad things they’ve said about it.
[S3] Right, and they’re more than aware of how many people would do it and experiment, and try it /you know what goes on with it at college /I think there’s even people that would turn their backs to it because they know it’s irrelevant /you know
[S1] There are even some colleges who turn their back to it /um /in a lot of places it’s much more /I don’t know exactly if accepted is the word
[S2] I’ve heard of /uh /people actually getting caught by police and people would actually let them go /all they were doing is just smoking /you know
[S1] Yeah /I mean I guess it is /I mean there are /there was this school /I don’t remember which one it was, but there was like pictures of it online or something where everyone was outside smoking on the quad /and you can’t ignore everyone /you know what I mean /[laughter] /you can’t ignore over 100 people smoking marijuana on the quad
[S4] Wh-what?
[S1] It was /I mean clearly a very liberal school /but you can’t ignore something like that /so
I agree though /a lot of people do turn their back to it whereas someone may be not necessarily /I mean you just get caught and they find out they’re just smoking and the cops kind of let them go or not make it as big a deal as long as they’re not driving or endangering lives of others /I mean a lot of people don’t even seem to mind as much /so it gets to a point where it might not be legal, but no one cares /[laughter] /you know it could get to a point of that where, alright it’s not legal but we know everyone in the world does it /why not? /I don’t know when that point would be though
[S3] And, plus they’re gonna be so nervous to do it because they’re probably gonna /it’s gonna be hard for them to tax something that has been untaxed for this long and illegal /they can’t just be like well ok /and now that people use marijuana for now /it might go up a lot in price if it’s legalized /so it might continue to be illegally distributed /um, which is gonna create a problem /and the government’s gonna be like, we did this, we legalized it /now what’s going on you know? /they’re not gonna be able to just legalize anything they’re not gonna make money on
[S1] No, I know definitely /I mean that might be a reason for the government to do it
[S3] That’s probably the 
[S1] The only reason to
[S2] Yeah, that’s what I was thinking /and definitely
[S3] That’s probably the number one reason.
[S1] I’m sure, but then you’re right cause then people would be like, well no if I’ve been doing this for how long 
[S3] For [inaudible] why am I gonna buy it for seventy because the government said it’s ok
[S1] Right, there will be people who still sell it for the price that they’ve always sold it /I mean I’m sure /I mean I don’t know
[S3] Right /cause they’re gonna make more money you know if you have this great government store that sells it for significant amounts more
[S1] Government marijuana store
[Laughter]
[S3] Love that /um
[S2] Um /one little thing /gonna relate it back to the Catholic Church thing /that I just thought of /um /someone I know /um /confessed to a priest that they smoked marijuana and he told that person that /um / it’s not a sin /he said /uh /that it’s like if you do /like if you sin under the act /then that’s like a sin
[S1] Then actually doing it isn’t a sin
[S2] Yeah, so, that’s kinda interesting. Plus, if you did a sin under the act, it’s still a sin anyway /so /[laughter] /so basically, like I don’t know if /I don’t know the official Catholic stance, but if I mean /that’s kind of interesting
[S1] At least one priest didn’t think it was a problem.
[S2] Yeah /[laughter] /throwin that out there
[S1] I mean yeah, there was that whole generation that everyone did /you know around
[S2] Hippies /the hippies
[S1] Yeah, I mean really /like obviously I wasn’t there so I couldn’t tell you about it first-hand, but there was a whole generation /there was a whole generation /I mean like the Beatles have an entire album related to getting high /you know /it was such a big part of pop culture
[S3] Well /I mean when I’ve /I’ve discussed the topic with my Mom /and she just /her favorite line is just /it was just different back then /literally, cops turned their backs to it /they were doing it too /I mean 
[S1] That’s what I was saying, it was everybody.
[S3] So widespread /um
[S1] You kinda have to wonder if it could ever be back like that /and again probably not on the same scale /but as we were saying now /it’s probably not a big percentage /but, of cops ignoring it /and of people kinda turning their backs to it now
[S3] Right, as more problems come out
[S1] You kinda have to wonder if eventually it’s gonna be turned their back upon where could it be like that again? Where it’s almost like /where everyone does it and everyone know what’s being done /and you know it’s being done right there, but you just don’t go over there so you don’t have to do anything about it
[S4] Although, back then, it wasn’t just marijuana. It was also LSD /you know
