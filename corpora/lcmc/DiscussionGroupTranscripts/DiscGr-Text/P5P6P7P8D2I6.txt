GROUP 5678
IRAQ WAR

[Is everyone ready to begin?]

[S5 S6 S7 S8] Yes

[Ok. The controversial war in Iraq has made news headlines almost every day since it began. How do you feel about the war?]

[S7] Honestly / I don’t really know much about the war / until / like / I / I came to college and / I heard a lot of different discussions about it / and / it’s actually / like / [inaudible] / just to think about it / it’s not even a war / cause it never was declared a war / so / it’s just / and I don’t really like the fact of / the / um / at first / like when September 11th happened I was like / go over there / ya know / raise all kinds of hell / because / ya know / they did this to all of our people and at really innocent people / and I have family in New York and that was something that was real / ya know / like / [inaudible] about / but / it’s just / I kind of feel like / America thinks that we’re so big and bad that we need to go over there and try and change Iraq to / meet / to fit our standards / and to / ya know / cause we have democracy / so / they think / well / democracy is the way to go / and / ya know / that’s / there’s institutions over there that have been established before we even got over there / so / it’s kind of wrong for them to just come over there and just start taking over stuff

[S5] I think it’s / um / not noble / but / I think it was / the attempt had good intentions in it but I don’t think it’s really helped that much / so I could see where people say just bring the troops back but then at the same time I kinda feel safer knowing / that / they’re there / and / that like / the fighting is being focused over there and not here / like / cause I couldn’t even imagine what life would be like / living there

[S7] Yea

[S5] If like the war was here / so / I mean / I guess I would have to say / I support it / because / more for selfish reasons because me and my / I know that / I’m still safe here

[S6] And I think it was probably the single worst tactical decision a president in office has made / within at least the last 50 years / because

[S5] What do you mean by tactical?

[S6] I mean / from a strategic standpoint / if you want to make America safer / that’s not the way to do it / even the CIA published reports saying that / the instances and the risk of terrorism / in the United States is now much greater than it was before

[S5] Because they sent over so many troops?

[S6] Because of the Iraq war / because that entire region’s been destabilized now / because there’s no longer any central authority / not / not to say that Saddam was a good guy / but you had Saddam in power / that country was stable / even / even though he was committing atrocities

[S5] But now we’ve just got so many more enemies / coming from anywhere

[S6] Yea / uh-huh

[S8] What I don’t understand though / is like / how we initially / really / even just diverged to Iraq / after September 11th we sent our troops to Afghanistan / like / a couple weeks later

[S6] Which actually made sense

[S8] The next thing I know / I’m hearing that there’s a war in Iraq and I’m just wondering what’s going on in Iraq now

[S6] Yea

[S8] I thought Osama Bin Laden was the guy we were looking for / and now they have weapons of mass destruction / which / we find out they don’t actually have / and / I / I don’t know / it all went down hill / we just destabilized their government / we took Saddam out of power but we didn’t really accomplish anything we just left them in a greater state of chaos than we / went in there to

[S6] And I think our government deliberately gave the American people misinformation / leading up to the war / even Collin Powell after leaving office has said that he did not trust the information that he was getting about there being WMDs in Iraq at the time

[S5] What does WMD / I’m sorry

[S6] Weapons of mass destruction / like nuclear weapons / or / biologic weapons

[S5] Oh / he didn’t believe that himself?

[S6] Yea / cause he went before the UN and presented that evidence and he has since said that he did not trust the evidence at the time / he did not think it was reliable / or entirely accurate

[S5] So what / they were telling us so we would support / them being there?

[S6] I think that’s what happened / I didn’t / I mean / you’re gonna have a hard time proving that’s what happened / but

[S7] I feel like that’s true though / because / I feel like afterwards / ya know / after September 11th you saw like / so much / of like the U.S just coming together / there were flags on like overpasses and you really felt like / a sense of community and like / connections with everyone / and they may not have gotten effected by it / but they were like / was just like / ya know / that’s my people / that even / I may not know them / but still / what if that coulda been me type of thing

[S8] Uh-huh

[S7] So / I mean / I feel like / the / the way they did it / because just riling people up gets your support and that’s really what he wanted was the support / so I feel like if he got the support then / the rest of the government or whatever / the whole government thing works / would have been like / ok / cause they’re feeling the pressure that people are like / let’s go / then they’re gonna be like / let’s go too / but / if they really knew / if a lot of people really knew what it was / they would have probably just been like / ya know what / just leave them alone [Laughter]

[S6] Uh-huh

[S8] Yea / I think that’s a good example / I think the government definitely did take advantage of 9-11 / the whole / like / catastrophe and everything

[S7] Yea

[S8] And they kind of used that to push their own motives / in a way / as wrong as it sounds / I think that’s probably what might have happened / because / 

[S6] I think that’s almost certain

[S8] Yea / they sent them over to Afghanistan / to find Osama Bin Laden / then all of a sudden they’re in Iraq / they capture Saddam Hussein in a matter of months / and / Osama Bin Laden is still nowhere to be found / and / I just find that really weird / because / I don’t know / Saddam has like / these people who are made to look like him / and everything like that / but somehow they found the right guy / whereas Osama / like / I think he’s probably one of a kind

[S6] Yea

[S7] Yea

[S8] Except for nowadays / when / now he’s becoming / probably a bigger threat / Al Qaeda’s like / growing / and / becoming a bigger threat now that we’re over / across seas / and / we’re kind of / we got all this focus on Iraq / we’re still trying to stabilize that / so / they’re / I don’t know / for all we know / they could be planning something

[S7] Yea

[S8] To / take advantage / because we’re all over there

[S7] I wonder what made this movement / like from Afghanistan to Iraq though

[S6] I think / they saw / I think the Bush Administration came into the office with the intent to go to war in Iraq / because / they’ve had a vendetta against Saddam Hussein for a long time / there have been U.N. and U.S. sanctions against him for years and years and years / and / part of the assassination attempt against George Bush Senior was traced back to Iraq. I think they came in with a vendetta / I think they / intended to go into Iraq / and I think / part of what they want / is to have Iraq destabilized / so that they had to use the United States as a crutch / because / if Iraq has to use the U.S. as a crutch then the U.S. has economic leverage in that country

[S7] Yea

[S6] And we can get cheaper oil / and I think that’s ultimate / they wanted economic gains from this as well as / kind of a / a post [inaudible] imperialism / almost

[S7] Are you like a politics major or something?

[S6] No / I just really don’t like George Bush [Laughter]

[S7] Me neither

[S8] That makes three of us

[Laughter]

[S5] I have no strong feeling / so / um / I mean / on president / whatever / politics

[Laughter]

[S5] So I can’t agree or disagree with you guys [Laughter]

[S7] Do you have another question?

[So do you think they’ve been over there long enough? Do you think they should be coming home now? Think they should finish what they have started?]

[S7] I / I mean / I’m kind of up in the air with that / because the fact that / they’re / they’ve been over there / like they just / we just caused so much / like / havoc / and chaos over there that / if we left / there’d be so much more 

[S5] Yea

[S7] And I feel like if we left / there wouldn’t be an Iraq

[S6] Yea

[S8] Uh-huh

[S5] Yea / that would be kind of unfair / to just leave them now / after we’ve kind of tore down everything 

[S7] Yea / and like / even more of a vendetta / cause like you said / we’d get even more of a vendetta against us / wow / that’s scary / um [Laughter] / so / I don’t know / I feel like / cause 

[S5] We need to finish the job now

[S7] Yea / they need to find the way to finish the job / because / a lot of / I mean / just looking on / in like / the news / and on TV / and in / on / in the newspapers and just seeing like / this young family lost its father and husband / it’s just really sad / because as an adult coming up now / I’m just kind of like / I wouldn’t want that / but / it’s just really sad for them because they’re losing family members over something that’s not even really real / like it’s not like constitutionally declared / they were just like / let’s go

[S8] Uh-huh / yea / I think that um / what was I gonna say / um / yea / I think that / um / we can’t really pull the troops out until we finish what we started / I mean / we went in there / we did probably as much damage as Saddam Hussein did in his / in his time in power / and / now / if we were to just leave them in / this state / they would / it would just be complete anarchy / I mean / you’d see / everybody would be worse off / without / us / over there at this point / because of / the government over there isn’t stable / at all / like / the / the whole like system of government that they decided to choose / they decided that they’re gonna throw a democracy into Iraq / if you throw a democracy into Iraq / these people are used to totalitarian dictatorship / they’re going to really know what to do / with this / I mean / you’re giving them something completely different than what they’re used to

[S7] Yea 

[S8] It’s like / it’s like bringing someone / I don’t know / bringing someone from back in time to the modern country or something / and just showing them something that they’ve never seen before / and / they’re / not used to that at all / so / it’s gonna just cause more problems than actually solve / like sure / they could want freedom / but / this isn’t the way to go about giving it to them

[S6] I think they went in without being adequately prepared to deal with withdrawal 

[S7] Uh-huh

[S6] At the same time / I think it’s become increasingly obvious that the initial plan for going into Iraq was extremely poorly conceived 

[S8] Yea / I think it only had like three parts / go in / set up democracy / leave

[S6] Yea / Yea

[Laughter]

[S8] But they forgot about all the stuff / [Laughter]

[S6] And they had it just on a post-it note / in Bush’s office / this is what we’re gonna do / and I think it / it’s also become obvious that / the cultural gaps between our American culture and the culture that they have in Iraq / are so / the gulf there is so large / that the idea / like you were saying / the idea that you could come in and establish / democracy / especially with / a group of / of Muslims / who are used to the government being dictated by religious factions / and then / coming in / trying to institute a secular democracy / is just / that’s like putting oil and water together and expecting them to cook

[Yea / so what do you guys think about that? The difference between cultures]

[S8] Oh / yea / I definitely think it’s a much different culture / I mean / like especially since / Muslims / like the Muslim religion and all of that / like / I mean / people see like / Iraq and all of that as like the government / forcing the / forcing like the strong practices of religion / which it was an everything / but now that’s so ingrained in the people’s minds / that trying to change that / those ideas / it’s just gonna be a lot more hectic / because you’ll have all on one side the people who don’t want to change and then you have the other side is the people who do want to change / and when they clash / it’s just civil war / I mean / we’ve already seen civil war start / and just break out between the Sunnis and the Shiites / so / I don’t think you can really clash our cultures and expect a good result from that

[S6] Yea / you have to kind of wonder why they / the Kurds are the third major ethnicity in Iraq / and you have to kind of wonder why they haven’t worked on setting up an independent Kurdistan at this point / because the Kurds have been fighting for that for years / and / frankly / they’re the best self-managed / ethnicity / in Iraq / and the only reason the Kurds haven’t split off as an independent country so far is because a lot of the major oil fields in Iraq are on Kurdish land / so I think that / that right there is very indicative of the fact that a lot of the reasons for what’s happened in Iraq so far has been economic

[S5] Uh-huh

[Do you want to elaborate on your personal feelings about what’s going on?]

[S7] I don’t really have much else to say [Laughter] / Sorry

[Anything?]

[S8] I’m trying to think of something else to say.

[S7] Yea / I don’t really

[S8] I probably have something somewhere / but / it’s not floating to my mind right now

[S6] I don’t think / I think there’s a certain amount of arrogance to thinking that you can go into a country and just all of a sudden establish the exact same kind of government that you have / because you think it’s the [inaudible] model of government / now / don’t get me wrong / I like democracy / I think it’s a pretty good idea but I don’t think it’s something you can march around forcing other people to do

[S7] Yea

[S6] I think it’s a natural process that has to occur over time.

[S7] I actually realized that when I like thought about / um / like / how women could / just / ya know / women get killed off of real / just real stupid things / I don’t even know / like / ya know / if they go off and they have an affair / or / if they just do something / that’s not what their husband wants / they can just / get killed / if ya know / if a woman doesn’t want to get married when the father wants them to get married / and / goes off and does something else / then / they can get killed for that / but if you really think about it / I was / I was like / I was glad we were going in to turn that way around / but / they’re happy like that / which is really odd about / ya know / I really / I found that like really surprising / that they’re like / if you see them talking / you’re like / we’re / you’re happy / they’re making their own businesses / doing their own thing / they don’t mind covering themselves from head to toe / in like 100 degree weather / so

[S8] I think / yea / I think in order to / get democracy / first you have to make them want it / I mean / if you look at the establishment of America / like the colonies back in the colonial ages / like you had the Monarch / and everybody was satisfied with the Monarch / they had the Monarch here / the parliament / and all of that / and the people over in Britain / if / their thoughts of / um / democracy / was pretty much anarchy / they were afraid of it / they didn’t want it / they / didn’t want to think anything of it / but then once they got over into the colonies and they wanted to declare independence from Britain because of like / the / I don’t know / just the force that Britain had over them / they kind of changed their opinions on it / and they wanted it / rather than / opposed it / I just think / if we want to do that / if we want to setup a government in Iraq / first we have to find something that’s going to work for them and work for us

[S7] Yea / definitely

[So what do you think about that then / that the cultures are different and we might be forcing our own values onto their culture]

[S5] Um / I think it’s a tough situation / and / I don’t really like thinking about it that much / just because it’s so complicated and it can almost give you a headache thinking about / the / what ifs and / everything / I don’t really / I don’t know / I think it’s a shame that any of this has to happen / that we have to be put in this position / or that we have to put them in this position / that any of this / happened to begin with

[S8] Yea / I definitely think that / something definitely could have been done in the beginning / like / they could have had some way to go about doing this / and fixing everything / fixing some of the problems over there / but / I think their approach to it was completely wrong / and they’ve just ended up screwing things up worse than they’ve actually fixed / so 

[S5] Yea / I think / maybe / we made a mountain out of a mole hill

[Laughter]

[S8] Yea / [Laughter]

[S5] Just

[S7] I think Bush is one of the worst presidents ever / because / I mean / I feel like / like I said before / I feel like the government / should cater to the people / and I’m like / at this point / no one really likes him / I don’t even know those / um / those polls / I forgot the names of the polls / the / I don’t know

[S5] Both of them know it [Laughter]

[S8] Public 

[S6] Public approval rating

[S8] Approval rating / yea

[S7] Yea / and it’s like / he has / like / probably like 20-30 percent / and then the rest is everyone else saying / no / we want him to leave / I feel like / this / the 2008 election’s gonna be like huge / because / they’re gonna want / we’re gonna want someone / cause I’m voting / so I’m so excited about that now / so we’re gonna want someone who / is gonna like / make a complete turn around / and / make / not even a complete turn around / but we’re gonna want someone that’s gonna fix his mess

[S8] Yea

[S5] So what happens if a democrat goes into office?

[S7] I’m gonna be freaking excited.

[Laughter]

[S5] What happens in Iraq? Are the troops automatically pulled out?

[S8] No / definitely not / I don’t see that happening

[S5] So / it doesn’t really matter then / if / we change presidents 

[S6] I think there will be a bigger push for a phased withdrawal

[S8] Yea

[S6] If a democrat is elected

[S5] A slow withdrawal

[S6] Not / I’m not sure what the speed will end up being / I think there will definitely be / more motion towards a withdrawal if a democrat is elected / I think there will more emphasis on nation building / and on making the Iraqi government stable / and right now they’re even talking about having a coalition of governments from the surrounding countries / come in / to rule Iraq / because

[S5] Oh / to get other nations in on helping us?

[S7] Probably that

[S6] Yea / that / I mean

[S5] Or just giving it / handing it off / to them / like here / we tried

[S6] Yea / pretty much

[Laughter]

[S6] That’s essentially what would happen / and that’s / that’s not a great idea either

[S5] No / it’s not

[S6] Cause a lot of / a lot of those countries are also / contain many, many terror cells

[S8] And a lot of those countries don’t really / like each other 

[S6] Uh-huh

[S7] Yea / I think we’d really just be going / just to like / gain / ya know / be / like sabotage it / I guess

[S6] Gain more land

[S7] Yea / gain more land / that’s what I was trying to say / yea

[S6] I think / that / historically / like / 50 or 75 years down the road / the end result of this might be that George Bush went and destroyed Iraq as a country / Iraq is just not going to exist 10 years from now / that might end up being the result

[S7] Uh-huh

[S5] That’s so unfortunate

[What do you guys think about that? Do you agree?]

[S7] Um / yea / I do / just like / 

[S6] Like

[S7] Sorry / a lot of concepts in our world today / I feel like when our generation is gonna be / ya know / when our generation is in power / or our generation is making better / bigger decisions / and / I feel like / a lot of things / like the whole gay marriage is going to be legalized / I feel like / um / Iraq is just / gonna be done / ya know / I feel like a lot of things will / I think in a way / I feel like our generation will make a lot of things a lot easier / ya know [Laughter] / we’ll just be like / oh / ok / I like it

[Laughter]

[S7] Ya know / and we’ll just go on with life / and not just be stuck in a rut like / for / I mean / this whole Iraq thing has gone for what / five, six years now / and / it needs to be done / like the news is / the first thing you see on the news is war in Iraq / terroroism, war in Iraq / it’s annoying now

[S8] In all honesty / I could see that though / I could definitely see / um / this just be like / the complete obliteration of Iraq / and this be like their last stand before the fall

[Laughter]

[S8] And somehow they’re gonna fall to the powers around them and they’re going to expand their territories maybe

[S6] Uh-huh

[S8] I mean / with all the damage that has been done so far / they’re / basically living in ruin / I mean 

[S7] They are / [Inaudible]

[S6] Yea

[S8] It’s completely destroyed 

[S5] But what about us? What if that ever happened to us? Do you ever see it coming here?

[S8] What? Us / um / being destroyed?

[S5] Not fully destroyed / but

[S8] I could definitely see / um / some kind of other power / overpowering America / I mean / history only shows that / I mean / with the Roman Empire / you’ve had the Roman Empire / you’ve had the British Empire / all these different

[S5] And they all collapsed

[S8] Yea / like all of these different empires / just rise and fall / and 

[S6] Uh-huh

[S8] It’s / I mean / you can’t say that America’s gonna be the / top power forever / I mean / someday someone’s gonna rise up and takeover / and for all we know / it could be Russia / or

[S6] China

[S8] China / yea / or even Japan

[S6] Uh-huh / they make good electronics

[S8] Yea / [Laughter]

[S6] They could do it

[S7] I don’t know / I’m sorry / [laughter] / that’s all I got / I don’t know if I can say anything else

[S6] Um / impeach Bush / that’s all I got [Laughter]

[S5]  Impeach

[Laughter]

[S6] He’s committed / he’s committed at least several impeachable offenses / by now

[S7] I feel sorry for Laura / Laurie / Laura? Whatever her name is

[S5] Laura Bush

[S7] There you go / I feel sorry for her. She’s such a sweet lady.

[S5] There’s two / oh wait / is that his wife or one of his daughters?

[S7] His wife

[S8] His wife

[S5] Doesn’t he have a daughter Laura Bush?

[S6] He has two daughters / Jenna and something else

[S5] Oh / it’s not Laura?

[S6] No / I don’t think it’s Laura

[S7] [Inaudible]

[Laughter]

[Do you guys have any other thoughts on this topic?]

[S6] Um 

[S5] What was the original question? What are our thoughts?

[Um / how you feel about the war in Iraq / if you think it’s gone on long enough]

[S6] I think / the other problem / with the war / is that / Bush has established a foreign policy precedent / that anytime that / the precedent of the preemptive strike / that anytime America feels threatened / someway we have the right to go into that country and eviscerate it / and I think that’s an extremely dangerous precedent to set / and I think that’s what he’s done here

[S7] He’s made a law about that?

[S6] No / it’s just the idea / that like / when a President does something that puts the idea out there / that the President is capable of doing that

[S7] I feel like / I don’t feel like this / is it called the Patriot Act? Where / he can go / and / if he feels suspicious of anything 

[S8] Yea

[S7] He can go in there and / just / do whatever he wants / and / I feel like it’s just giving him a whole load of power 

[S6] I feel

[S7] And / kinda like too much power over us / and it / ya know / separating the president from normal people type thing / and / that’s [Inaudible]

[S8] Yea / I definitely think that one of the / one of the government’s main tactics especially for this war / had been / the / using fear to / kind of either / gain support or like just keep the people quiet / keep them in subordination so they can go out and do what they want / because / I mean / if / with the Patriot Act / if you think about it / how suspicious that kind of is / like / ok / so now / if they’re / if you say something against the war / at like / out at a public speech / they could accuse you of being a terrorist / or something like that / and it’s just putting all this fear into the people who want to stand up and say something / to come out and say it / and then you have on the other hand like / these / like / they / they had those whole terror warnings / like they had / the / little meters / like / the green, orange, red, and yellow and stuff / and / just like having something like that / just so people can say / like / here’s your daily weather report on / the chances of a terror attack / and / people just think / oh / ok / today there’s a high chance / I support the war / I mean / I support the war on terror / we’re gonna fight them / and / fix this

[S6] I think / a lot of political scientists talk about / in American government you seeing the pendulum of power swing back and forth between the congress and the President for certain periods / and it kind of goes back and forth / um

[S5] Does congress support the war in Iraq?

[S6] Um / not now / not now that it’s funded by the Democrats / but / I mean / just in terms of who really holds the attention / holds / the bulk of the power in the government / they talk about that pendulum of power swinging back and forth / and / I think we’ve kind of left a period when congress held the bulk of the power for like the last 15, 20 years / and George Bush has worked very hard to expand presidential power during his administration

[Do you guys have any other thoughts on this topic?]

[S5] Not really. 

[Ok. End of Discussion]
