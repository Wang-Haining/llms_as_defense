CATHOLIC CHURCH
[In your opinion, does the Catholic Church need to change its ways to adapt to life in the 21st Century?]
[S12] That’s the one blog that we’ve had
[S11] Oh, my /I have nice, fun opinions about this one /um /absolutely /I mean, think about it /the Catholic Church once condemned the fork
[Laughter]
[S11] They did. They condemned utensils. They need to change with the times /I mean look at just the way our society is does not fit with the way our society was when the rules were set down in the medieval times.
[S12] Right, well what I said /just probably gonna rip this completely from the blog /at least what I remember from it /it was so long ago /um /was that I read something to the effect that /um /when people tend to lose sight of what the church’s or the ideal intention of the church /that being like uh spiritual or at least giving people some semblance of structure in terms of living out their faith /or rather having a more fulfilling experience /like living /but, people tend to get caught up in the logistics and the details /not to say that they’re not important, but some people forget that /or they harp on the fact that there’s the human element driving the church forward, and while they’re problems with it /like clerical behavior and stuff like that /um people tend to focus on that more so than like the whole ideal aspect, but the reality is very important
[S9] I mean who’s /but who’s to say that you know the society of the 21st century is so great or 
[S10] Better?
[S9] Yeah, better or /I mean that /that the Catholic church should conform to it, and I mean maybe it’s a good thing that on certain issues it clashes
[S11] I have a question. Who’s Catholic? Are you Christian?
[S10] Nope.
[S11] What are you, just out of curiosity?
[S10] I’m Jewish.
[S11] You’re Jewish? Ok, um /I’m non-denominational anything /I don’t believe in organized religion.
[S9] So, agnostic?
[S11] Basically /um I’ll go to church if I feel like I need it /I think I don’t need to go to church to speak to a higher power if that’s what I need /so to me, the Catholic Church is absolutely bonkers
[S10] Yeah, I think it’s /I just think it’s like /like you don’t /you talk about the Methodist church or the Episcopalian Church
[S11] Well, that’s also because you don’t have to go confess to a man who has no right to tell you [inaudible]
[S10] It’s something that’s like /been given power through like centuries /yeah
[S11] It’s like, Ok /because they’re right /because we said they were right in the past, we have to say they’re right now, because if we say they’re not right now /that means automatically they’re not right then
[S9] Wait, what?
[S11] Catholic Church /if you think about it they say /a lot of times the reason they say they can’t change something is because that would mean that they’re admitting that they’re wrong, and they can’t be wrong /they’re human /give them /I mean what do you think about on the issue with the Pope?
[S10] Well, see that’s the thing /the Pope isn’t supposed to be human
[S11] Which makes no sense /he’s human
[S10] The Pope is supposed to be an extension of Christ, right?
[S9] Well, he’s human, but he’s infallible.
[S11] But, that’s not possible. No human can be infallible.
[S12] Well when teaching /um /in matters at least /that’s the doctrine I’m not saying /just like a personal /I’m not sure /but, just like speaking doctrinally /the idea is that he is without error on that
[S11] Now, I’ve gotten different opinions on this one
[S9] Yeah, he’s not /I’m sorry
[S11] No, go ahead.
[S9] He’s not without error /I think like /in terms of his actions or anything like that, but in terms of doctrine
[S11] The Pope was in Hitler’s youth /that’s not an error?
[S10] Well, this particular Pope wasn’t.
[S11] This particular Pope was in Hitler’s youth, but if he’s infallible is he automatically infallible from time he’s elected Pope? That doesn’t make sense.
[S12] What I heard about that was that /that was more coercion /I don’t know these things, but 
[S11] Umm, still
[S12] Especially if
[S10] All German born boys and girls were in different
[S12] Right /plus you have to consider he was a kid.
[S11] But, he’s also said /like he’s stated that it was his choice /he’s stated it /he has talked about it /it wasn’t by coercion for him /this is something I feel really strongly about /I’m sorry /this is just /there’s no way for a person to be infallible /especially if /oh, Ok, so he becomes Pope and everything he’s ever done has never been a mistake
[S12] I don’t know that it’s personal per say, but with respect to like the general scope of the church and like /um teachings and dogma and principles and stuff like that / not to say that being Pope immediately validates him for all the stuff that he’s done or that it could /because it doesn’t really make sense, but the teaching of infallibility is that you don’t question the Pope on those issues /which I’m not sure about
[S11] I was raised Catholic so I know the dogma /I was raised Catholic and Lutheran /weird combination /I went to church twice every Sunday /my entire life /I was baptized when I was in fifth grade /my parents gave me a choice to be Lutheran or to be Catholic /it was crazy /I’m sorry, I’m sorry /all of my friends are Catholic /it just doesn’t make sense to me /and also
[S9] But why, but why is it that you think that it should change? /being not a part of it
[S11] I think that it needs to change /I think that it’s /a lot of parts of the Catholic Church have always needed to change /I mean women aren’t allowed in the clergy
[S9] That is something that I feel we should change as well.
[S11] Why /honestly according the Catholic Church, women are the root of all evil /that is still doctrine
[S9] In /uh / to point out that there are some married Priests in the Catholic Church
[S11] Episcopalians /and if it’s in the Catholic Church they’re 
[S10] Yeah, but they’re not Catholic.
[S11] Yes they are /Episcopalians, and I can’t remember the other one /they’re a branch of Catholicism
[S9] In the Roman Catholic Church 
[S11] It’s only if you were married before you became a Priest /you can’t be married after you become a Priest
[S9] Exactly /I’m just
[S10] Episcopalian
[S11] They’re Catholic
[S10] I don’t think so. I don’t think they have anything to do with
[S11] My friend’s an Episcopalian /Catholic
[S10] I don’t know, what do you think of that?
[S12] I don’t know.
[S11] It’s a branch of Catholicism /I’m Protestant /I am Protestant /I’m baptized, I used to teach Sunday school
[S10] Yeah, yeah /I just
[S11] Episcopalians are a branch of Catholicism /they just don’t agree with everything /they’re still considered Catholic
[S10] Hmm, that’s interesting.
[S11] Um /but, when it comes to Communion /I’ve gotten different opinions from different Catholics on this /is it the body and blood of Christ? Is it symbolism? Personally, not doctrinally /because I know the doctrine /personally, as a Catholic, do you believe that it’s really blood and flesh that you’re eating /cause that’s what it’s supposed to /it’s supposed to be transmographied into body and flesh of Christ /that’s what the Catholic Church says
[S12] For me, I understand it more metaphorically than that.
[S11] Ok
[S12] I mean
[S11] As Catholic, you’re supposed to believe that it’s literal.
[S9] Here’s my question /what does that have to do with 21st century and why the church needs
[S11] Science /we have the proof that it’s not possible, also things like the view from the Catholic Church that a Priest can forgive you for your sins 
[S9] It’s, but it’s not 
[S11] I honestly think that as a society, we’ve grown the point where we’ve realized that no one can forgive us for our sins besides ourselves and God.
[S9] But, it’s not the Priest /who is forgiving you /it’s God forgiving you 
[S11] Then why is the middle man there? I mean I understand that it was there during the Dark Ages because people didn’t really connect with God, but people have the ability to now.
[S12] That makes it easier from like just reading and stuff /it’s supposed to make it easier for people to relate or to live in a more /to live out their faith /to have like a face to which they can /through which they can kind of /it’s hard to express, but /um / to some it would be easier to have someone to go to, rather than say stare off somewhere and be like 
[S11] Ok, I can see that. That’s / I could see that’s the reason for having a Priest /the confession doesn’t make sense to me /it never will
[S9] Isn’t that a personal choice, that doesn’t really effect
[S11] I don’t know /I don’t know if I agree because according to Catholicism you’re not allowed to go up to the altar unless you’ve confessed that day /on Sundays when you go to church
[S10] Doesn’t /every religion has that /that’s old
[S11] I don’t agree with organized religion in general /that’s just my thing
[S12] Well, what I said earlier /it’s just I feel like we end up splitting hairs and
[S11] Ok, I have another one. Sorry /when it comes to issues of contraception, right? The Catholic Church is against it /now back a little /not even far back /families were a lot bigger because you could support them on land, could support them /money could support them /that’s not possible now, and to expect a /just basically you’re supposed to /you’re allowed to have sex with your parents /with you’re a spouse /your parents? /haven’t slept in two days 
[S9] It’s Ok.
[S11] With your spouse /and not only for procreation reasons, but you’re not supposed to use contraception? It’s not /I think it’s almost /what’s the word I’m looking for? Not detrimental, but it’s irresponsible of the church to say you can’t use contraception just population wise /especially with the amount of people that are Catholic and the amount of people that dogmatically follow /that follow what the Catholic dogma is /dogmatically follow? /doggedly follow what Catholic dogma is
[S10] Um, just as an aside real quick /I just /uh /texted my Episcopalian, theology major friend /it’s not a branch of Catholicism
[S11] My mistake, I was thinking of something else.
[S10] It’s Ok, it’s Ok /no, it’s alright /I just wanted to clear that cause 
[S11] Then there must be another, there’s another /I know there’s a branch of Catholicism that’s not /I must just be mixing up the name, so my apology
[S10] No, no that’s fine. That’s fine. I just had to make sure for myself.
[S9] But, there are Roman Catholic /even /married Priests
[S10] True.
[S11] But, they also have to be married before they become
[S9] I know, I know, I’m just /Priest thing /it wasn’t a 
[S11] But, just back to what I’m saying about the contraception /like I think it’s irresponsible not only fiscally, but for the world in general /it’s irresponsible
[S9] Sorry that [inaudible]
[S11] Like, do you have any opinion on it whatsoever or /cause I know there’s a lot of Catholics that do listen to it, and a lot of Catholics that don’t /so /and as a Catholic should you listen to everything that the Catholic Church says?
[S12] I wouldn’t /no
[S9] No, I don’t.
[S11] So then don’t you think it should change? /if you don’t agree with it /if there are things that you don’t agree with for good reasons /shouldn’t /and there’s a lot of people that disagree with it, but they’re still claiming to be Catholic /isn’t that a problem?
[S12] But, you got the whole realm of like Church politics and other stuff like that /like a friend of mine /um /he’s a psych major at the University of Maryland /um /he’s entering into the seminary after he graduates /um /and we’ve had this discussion /like um /that some aspects of like church politics and how things go are just ridiculous /based more on
[S11] But, shouldn’t they change then? /if they’re ridiculous
[S12] Ideally, yes, but at the same time you run into this problem of tradition and people holding on to the things in the past, and some things should change and some things should stay the same
[S11] That’s what the question’s asking /should it change?
[S12] Yes.
[S11] I’m not saying everything has to change /just there are some things that are definitely, majorly problematic
[Do you want to explain what your feelings are?]
[S9] Um, yeah /I mean I don’t think you need to agree with everything that the /uh / Catholic Church /uh /proposes /or uh /the stance on issues /I don’t think you have to support everything that it says in order to be /um /part of the church /uh /and I do think there are things that should be changed /like I do think that women should be allowed to enter the clergy and I think that Priests should be allowed to marry /um /I mean
[S11] Quick question about the women and the clergy thing /do you think that adds to gender discrimination /just going back to /do you think that like the rule that women can’t be in the clergy /and they can only be nuns /do you think that adds to /gives people more of an excuse to say oh, it’s ok because it’s the Catholic Church that does it /just back to what we were talking about before /actually yeah /I mean I guess people could use that as a rationale /and I guess it is gender discriminatory
[S10] It is one of the only denominations of any religion where women can’t be the head religious 
[S9] Yeah /and I like what you’re saying /I think there are certain traditions that have become so much a part of the Catholic Church that I think it’s hard to change them /but I think they should be changed /like I think the whole Priests not marrying 
[S11] It’s not tradition, it’s rules /like there’s a difference between a tradition and a rule
[S9] Well, yeah /then /yes /rules /like with the whole priest not being able to marry thing /the whole reason that priests were banned from marrying in the first place is back in /uh /the /what century were we in? 
[S12] The 11th Century maybe.
[S9] Yeah, something like that /yeah /because it was common practice for priests to marry, but then once they start /once the Catholic Church starts becoming powerful and once priests are owning land and the kids /um /get the land and not the church /you know /that’s a problem for the church /because they want the land /so all this /so you know one of the main factors in priests not being able to marry is power
[S11] It has nothing to do with the religion.
[S9] I mean there /there is rational /and there are people who spoke about /who wrote about how priests shouldn’t be allowed to marry because they should be completely devoted to God and the church and he can’t divide that sense of responsibility between the family and the church, but I think /I don’t know if you agree with me /that one of the main reasons was money and power /money and land
[S12] I agree with that.
[S9] Um, and /you know so it’s something /and then it’s something that became part of the rules and just has become tradition then
[S10] Right, all the rules you’re gonna look at  for every religions /I don’t mean to always bring it back to like every religion, but Catholicism isn’t really so far off from like different sects /Orthodox Judaism or
[S11] Oh, absolutely.
[S10] Or you know different /um you know /strictly following Muslims and so forth in that the rules were written in a time and age where everything was different and they’re not gonna change /you know /the written aspects of it /you can’t /people don’t have the power /you can’t rewrite the Bible /you can’t put amendments to the testament
[S11] Uhh /let me say something about that /the Bible did not arrive by fact from heaven /it’s written by man
[S10] Right, yeah /I know, I know
[S9] Well, yeah, and 
[S11] The same thing with the Torah and the Koran
[S10] Oh absolutely /but that’s what I’m saying, if they’re not gonna put amendments, you shouldn’t interpret it differently, but when you’re talking about the rules that they still follow /well, yes, the Catholic Church probably needs to change their /change their rules to certain things, but like on the same hand / like /I mean you also just have to like use your proper discretion /proper time and place discretion on things
[S9] Yeah, yeah /I think that people
[S10] Like Loyola not giving /like Loyola doesn’t have at the Health Center /like you know /condoms or day after pills and things like that /even though we have a school that like you guys said /drugs apparently /you know /so
[S11] Apparently?
[Laughter]
[S10] Sure /right /I mean /you know what I’m saying? /so it’s 
[S9] I mean I think people tend to dismiss the Catholic Church and maybe all organized religion too easily because particular things that they see need to be changed, but then I think there are lots of things that go against the life in the 21st Century that are important stands against it 
[S11] Like /um /what you were saying about it’s discretion /I know a lot of very, very intelligent people /I’m going to use my grandmother as an example /she built a pharmaceutical company in a time when /you know /women didn’t work in Germany /like went to med school /you know /she’s a very intelligent woman /she believes everything the Catholic Church says, and will listen to everything the Catholic Church says regardless of logic /regardless of science /because it is the Catholic Church and the Catholic Church is right, and there is a lot of people like that /I’m not saying that’s just the Catholic Church /there’s Muslims, Jews, Buddhists /not so much Buddhists /uh, Hindus /any religion almost is like that
[S10] You have people that strictly follow it /yeah, sure
[S11] And, it’s a big /it’s this whole /that whole /again 
[S10] Is /is there a problem with your grandmother following her /the religion that has probably done a lot for her in her life
[S11] Honestly /no it’s /I just think that sometimes there’s a problem with blindly following something
[S10] But that’s what makes religion different than like your own opinion on things /is that you have
[S11] You know what
[S10] There’s the whole aspect of like you’re not the only thing making decisions, you’re not the only reason that there is /you know
[S11] There’s also that, but I don’t know /I don’t think that I have to /I have my faith /I’m very strongly about my faith, but it’s not 
[S10] You have a philosophy, it sounds like
[S11] No, it’s faith to me. I believe in God.
[S10] Ok, sure.
[S11] I believe in God, I just have my own beliefs about who He is /and I think that’s absolutely /Ten Commandments /great thing /because they’re moral
[S10] Mmhmm
[S11] Those are things that 
[S10] But they’re also, I mean three of them are for your treatment of /uh /three of the Ten Commandments are for your treatment of God and the other seven are how to treat your fellow man, and I think of the ten /probably two or three /four or five of them aren’t applicable to common /to now
[S11] Like which? I’m curious.
[S10] Like which /I don’t know /um /what /I’m gonna think /off the top of my head /I don’t know /um / what the Ten Commandments are /but um /not everybody for example uses God’s name in vain all the time
[S11] Absolutely /I don’t think it’s um
[S10] That’s breaking the law.
[S11] I don’t know if it’s /mmm /I think that /Ok, I can see what you’re saying /I absolutely see what you’re saying, but like things like thou shall not kill
[S10] Sure
[S11] Thou shall not commit adultery, thou shall not steal
[S10] Isn’t it covet your neighbor’s possessions, isn’t that what it was?
[S11] Which technically
[S9] That’s another one.
[S11] That’s a different one /there is adultery /I can’t remember exactly how it’s worded
[S9] Well, there is /you know /thou shall not /um / commit adultery and thou shall not covet thy neighbor’s wife, and /and there’s
[S10] There’s also keep the Sabbath holy /which
[S9] And there’s though shall not steal, and it’s thou shall not covet thy neighbor’s possessions.
[S10] They’re all kind of one in the same. More or less
[S9] Well, yeah /one’s like the action and then the thought I guess
[S11] Sabbath is just technically day of rest. Technically /if you want to bring it down to bare bones, it’s the day that God rested, and it’s honestly Sunday /yeah it’s a day of rest for me
[S9] The thing is with the Catholic Church /the Catholics find rest in God
[S11] That’s fine. But, I honestly /saying that you have to go to church every Sunday is a little ridiculous. I don’t think that you have to be in a certain building to speak to God.
[S10] That’s more of  Jewish way of looking at God though, that it’s completely all around you and you don’t have to be within something because God is like /um / an all encompassing aspect of your life that you don’t have to go into a spot to see or talk to
[S11] No, I totally agree with you /but, the Catholic Church is one of the only religions that completely negates every other /like they say the Catholic Church /you’re Catholic, you have to be Catholic /you’re gonna go to heaven if you’re Catholic /I know it’s not like that /I don’t know /I’m not sure how it is exactly with the Jewish religion, but /the Christians, Protestants /you can come up to the altar and you can get a blessing no matter who you are /Catholics you can’t /you cannot come to the altar of God for communion if you are not Catholic
[S9] Are you
[S11] You can’t, not you can’t /I went /I’ve gone to Catholic Church since I’ve been baptized /I’m not allowed /I’ve talked to priests, I’ve talked to nuns of different sects /you’re not allowed to get a blessing during communion unless you’re Catholic
[S9] See, I always /at least I was always taught that you can
[S12] That’s what I heard.
[S9] But, if you put your hands right /you get a blessing
[S11] You are only allowed to be at the table of God if you are Catholic.
[Explain what you just said about this.]
[S9] Oh, that if you’re not Catholic when people are going up to receive communion, you don’t receive /and to show that you’re not Catholic you don’t receive /you put your hands over /like this and /um /and then they /the priests will give you a blessing
[S11] Since I’m not Catholic, and I was baptized Lutheran and confirmed Lutheran /I was not allowed to go up for communion at my Baccalaureate Mass even for a blessing /I was not allowed /it was a Catholic Church
[S9] Well, that’s /that’s something
[S11] That was at St. Patrick’s Cathedral.
[S9] That’s something new to me because I’ve always been taught something different /so
[S11] That’s at St. Patrick’s Cathedral /you’re not allowed /no
[Why don’t you talk about what you were taught?]
[S12] I was taught the same thing /if you like /and if there were kids that weren’t Catholic some of them sat down, but the majority of them /then again, it was an all guys Catholic high school /but the majority of them just went up and did the crossing of the arms over the chest
[S9] And as a Eucharistic Minister, I was also taught that I am not allowed to refuse communion to anyone. Whoever goes up /whoever goes up to obtain
[S11] I’m just saying what’s doctrine.
[S9] Right, well, I’m just saying this is what I’ve been taught in a Catholic Church.
[S11] That’s fine, I’ve never been trained as a Eucharistic Minister.
[S9] Yeah.
[S11] Um /but I was not allowed to go up to the altar at St. Patrick’s Cathedral, which to my father was a huge deal because my father was born and raised Catholic /he goes and does confession /that’s his thing /and he hasn’t had /he hasn’t confessed, he won’t get communion /you’re not allowed /you’re technically not allowed to get communion if you haven’t confessed that day
[S9] But, here’s a question /why does that /why does that exactly /if people you know want that in their life and they want that kind of life why should you 
[S11] It’s exclusive. The problem with the Catholic Church is that only Catholics are right /I mean there’s room for error, there’s no room for if someone is Muslim /you know /but leads a good life technically they can go to heaven, but no they don’t go to heaven /and they’re in limbo /mmmm
[S10] Isn’t the like Muslim faith /don’t they have other ways of going to
[S11] Um/ the Muslim faith says everyone will go to heaven because everyone is inherently Muslim, which I think basically /to me and to the people that I know are Muslim /says that just everyone is inherently good and if they lead a good life they’re gonna
[S10] But, they also believe in /preach these /um /I don’t know what it is /what the word is, but you die for /in the name of
[S11] What about the Crusades?
[S10] Allah? Maybe to be a martyr /yeah
[S11] That’s God, but what about the Crusades? People did the same thing in the Catholic religion.
[S10] I mean /I’m not talking about that, but anyhow they go to heave where they’re /if you do this, you go up to this magical place where it’s you and like seventeen virgins /something like that /that’s why all
[S11] I’m not saying it’s
[S10] That’s why all these people strap bombs and
[S11] Oh, I know. I’m not saying there’s not problems in any other religion, but that’s one that I notice that bothers me really /like that bothers me about the Muslim religion /there are things that bother me about the Muslim religion /about every religion /which is why I have problems with organized religion /I think there’s problems with all of them /I mean it’s great that people find /that people find solace in itself
[S10] It’s just supposed to give you guide headlines to which you interpret with what it means to yourself.
[S11] But, according to religion you’re supposed to follow it to the letter or you’re
[S10] Yeah, but there’s no according
[S9] People don’t
[S11] I’m just saying that /that’s what /that’s the dogma though
[S10] But, I think the point that to us /they’re trying to make /is you don’t live your life according to the religion
[S11] You’re supposed to
[S10] You live it around /not around, but
[S11] You’re supposed to live it according to the religion.
[S10] You’re not supposed to do anything. You don’t have to /you chose not to
[S11] I chose not to /that’s my choice
[S10] Right, you didn’t have to
[S11] But, if you have to choose to be in the Catholic Church, you’re supposed to follow it to the letter of the law.
[S9] But a lot of people /the majority of them don’t 
[S11] That’s /then they /then they /if you speak to strict Catholics, they will not consider you Catholic
[S10] I bet they would.
[S11] My grandmother does not consider my father Catholic anymore.
[S10 Why, cause
[S11] Because my father married a non-catholic woman, and because he doesn’t go to church every Sunday. 
[S10] See
[Do you want to /um /jump in with your opinion? Cause you guys seem to be on the Catholic end of it /at least knowing a little bit more]
[S12] I mean /as with anything it’s just /well you do have the point /the conflict of what is ideal and what is in fact going to happen rather /the reality of what people do seems to be what they should do rather than following things blindly to the absolute tee /um /I mean /in terms of following everything that kind of just says /I couldn’t do that /um / and think it’d be kind of unfeasible to do that
[S11] Did you fast on Ash Wednesday? You’re not supposed to eat on Ash Wednesday or Holy Thursday.
[S9] Only if you’re nineteen or older.
[S11] Are you? Sorry, my mistake /I kind of /I forget you guys are freshman
[S9] I’m eighteen.
[S12] I’m eighteen.
[S11] Ok /um my mistake /cause I thought 
[S9] For us, it’s just don’t eat meat.
[S11] Sorry, my mistake.
[S10] But, even still /really just dictating different laws that aren’t set in stone or 
[S11] And they’re supposed to be followed otherwise it’s a sin.
[S12] But, with the fasting /it’s not fasting for the sake of fasting or abstaining just to say that you did, but it’s supposed to /well, at least as I understand it /I’m not sure about the actual /uh literal teaching, but /uh /or explicit teaching /but it’s more symbolic than anything else
[S9] See, going back to the original question /I don’t think that the Catholic Church should conform to anything /I think that it should /if necessary change to /according to what’s right /is or 
[S11] I think the picture of right has changed over the ages too though.
[S9] Yeah, well what they feel is right, not necessarily what 21st Century society perceives as right /like /I mean I think there was/ a bunch of it in the Catholic Church goes against 21st Century society because according to what it believes are right like /you know /they’re against the death penalty, and abortion and [inaudible] /which I think is necessary /there are necessary stands that 
[S11] Um /that’s your opinion /I don’t begrudge you your opinion /um / I hope you don’t begrudge me mine
[S9] No, no I /no I completely understand where you’re coming from /I just don’t think that organized religion needs /should necessarily /should /you know /conform
[S11] I’m not so much saying conform as I’m saying that there are certain things that do need to change.
[S9] No, I /I agree with that
[S10] I think everyone agrees with that.
[S9] But, I think /but I think that /I think you can’t attack like every
[S11] No, I don’t attack every /there’s many things about any religion that are good and pure and fabulous for anyone that /not everyone maybe because for everyone it’s different, but I mean /there was a time when I was very religious /I taught Sunday school for four years /I was um kicked out of my church for teaching what was taught to me in my Confirmation class which was that the Genesis was /uh /symbolism, but the woman who ran the Sunday school didn’t agree with the priest, so she kicked me out for teaching what I was taught
[S9] Wow
[S11] And, I mean there’s problems anywhere /um / but, it kind of disillusioned me I guess /to it /so my views have changed /they’ve evolved, and I think that sometimes some parts /I think that the Catholic Church needs to evolve with humans /with our mentalities /not everything needs to change because they’re /I mean the basic tenets are still about being good, but things /a lot of things that are rules /are based on like you said money and power /and does the Catholic Church really need more money and power? Does any religion really need to be the only /like it /I don’t know /I don’t know where I’m going with that /I lost /my brain stopped /[laughter]
[Do you want to like sum up a little sentence for me and then we’ll stop.]
[Laughter]
[S12] Um /I mean it’s true the Vatican is resting on a massive amount of wealth /that’s just, that’s well known /but, um /and I do agree /not to sound repetitive but in the sense of revision /um /I would say that some of us like the idea of women becoming priests and priests being able to marry /I would support that, but you just run into the problem again of tradition or not the problem per say /or of rules /I’m not really sure what the distinction was between the two, but there is a problem there or at least a conflict /just to grossly oversimplify
[Ok]
