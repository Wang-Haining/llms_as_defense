IRAQ WAR
[Is everyone ready to begin? Ok. The controversial war in Iraq has made news headlines almost every day since it began. How do you feel about the war? Who would like to begin?]
[S20] This is gonna bring up Bush again.
[S19] Um /I think it’s a stupid war.
[How come? Can you explain?]
[S19] Because it hasn’t accomplished anything really /like people are just dying basically for no reason /and because nothing’s changed /the only thing that came out of it was Saddam Hussein was taken out of power, but since then nothing productive has happened.
[S20] That’s still a big accomplishment though.
[S19] Ok, well then he should have ended the war after that. 
[Laughter]
[S17] But the war didn’t accomplish that.
[S20] Yeah, I know. Ya know /you can’t really exactly pull the troops out of there. I’ve talked with a soldier about this exact topic and he said that if we do what a lot of people in America wanna do which is just take everybody out of there then like all of this friends died in anguish /and that’s just not cool at all.
[S17] But is it worth it to keep fighting a losing battle?
[S20] How are we losing?
[S17] Well, we’re not gaining anything. We’re just losing lives basically.
[S18] It’s awful that that’s the truth, but I mean I also have friends in the military /a lot of his buddies have died over in Iraq /but I don’ t think it’s worth it at this point for people to continue dying /I mean I don’t necessarily think they died in vain /I mean we fought the good fight but I mean the time is up / nothing /whatever goal we set out to accomplish has just been hazed over and it just seems to be like the same situation for the past like few months and it’s just not getting anywhere /so I think it’s time for us to get out of there.
[S20] But um /when I was talking with that soldier /what he was saying was /um /if you look at like previous wars /while the U.S. is in a different country and we’re looking to reform 
[S18] We didn’t lose as many, is that what you’re saying?
[S20] What’s that?
[S18] We didn’t /proportionally we haven’t lost as many soldiers /is that what you’re saying?
[S20] No. What I was gonna say was it’s taken a boatload of time to actually make and effect in that country /like with out effects /like uh /I don’t know a hundred percent of what I’m talking about so ya know /if I screw up let me know /but I think after World War II we were in countries and I think even today we’re still helping them reform /um /like now I just don’t understand how you guys would expect us to make a change over in the middle east when it’s only been such little time I guess /when in perspective with history
[S18] Well we’re not /I mean /I don’t know
[S19] But when we’re reforming these other countries, we’re not in war with them anymore /like
[S18] Yeah.
[S19] When we were fighting Germany and Japan and all those countries /we had a good reason to fight them /like Japan bombed us /that’s a good reason to start a war [laughter]. But like once the war was over they didn’t keep picking at it /like they let it /like yeah they helped it rebuild but that’s because we destroyed their cities
[S18] I think also that it’s a lot /with Iraq kinda went under the cloud of 9-11 /Afghanistan /alright take any person off the street /why did we go into Iraq? /Al-Kaida, 9-11! Terrorism! /What? /There’s no like /like the whole WMD /I mean 
[S20] That was crap.
[S18] Well I mean who knows. It’s all hearsay. They coulda like moved them /or once they didn’t have them there anymore /I mean what were we doing there? That’s kinda silly for me.
[S17] I think part of the problem is that no one like really presented a clear goal and the American people don’t really have a good idea of what we’re trying to accomplish, so all we see is the bad stuff /like we see people dying /we don’t see their 
[S20] It’s the media. The media only portrays that stuff most of the time because that’s what catches their attention. Then on the other hand, we could have moved them.  I don’t think we know exactly what’s going on /ya know /behind closed doors /I guess you could say
[S18] I mean well of course we don’t /ya know /that’s the way it should be
[S20] Um /that’s another reason why I kinda support Bush in this sense /that’s a way out there comment, I know /99.9% of America would not agree with me on that one /uhh /the thing that I believe is if you have a leader who you’re not going to accomplish anything ever if you don’t support him or her in the future /but if it’s Hilary then that’s just out of the question /no on should support her
[S18] See, like, that’s the thing.  For the longest time I was for the war and then actually everything just kept on stacking up and all the things that kept on happening /it just wore me down and at this point /I’m not at a point where I can just stand up for the war anymore /and it’s not like /it’s not like the liberal media or any other person like forced my decision /it’s not like /no one converted me /it just got to the point where I was just so sick and tired of hearing like too many bad things for every good thing we do over there
[S20] Well, that’ because the media /I believe
[S18] Yeah, but /there’s kids my age that are dead /people /kids shouldn’t be over there dying at this point I don’t think
[S17] I don’t know if the media would want to represent a negative view though /why would the media want to represent a negative view?
[S20] Cause that’s what grabs our attention
[S17] Yea, but people would be encouraged by seeing positives
[S18] Yeah, but
[S17] If something good happened, they’d still talk about it.
[S19] But if it’s a station that doesn’t agree with Bush, it’s obviously going to emphasize the negatives.
[S20] That’s 99.9%
[S18] Yeah, at this point /yeah
[S17] But, if something like undeniably good happened /you would hear about it and I don’t think we’ve heard about anything like that
[S18] That’s a good point. [laughter] Yeah, if a soldier like ran into a burning building to save a baby or something like that /like something like that 
[S17] The only like feel-good stories you hear about are /families in the United States doing things for people who have lost someone in the war /not like anything good happening over there
[S18] Yeah
[S19] Yeah
[S20] I had two very valid comments, but now they’re gone.
[S18] It’s just /some of the stuff like really hits home because like over the summer I had that job /that one kid that was over in Iraq /he uh joined before 9-11 /and he’s from Iraq originally so he kinda had his own like personal reasons for bein over there /so /he went back after /he was part of operation storm Baghdad /he was part of like the front line /like right after 9-11 /well right after they went into Iraq, excuse me /and um /he went back again /talking to the kid, and we’re on our way to work and I noticed he’s like smoking a pack of cigarettes /and I’m like oh you smoke when did you start doing that? /and he’s like well I got a carton for a buddy, but he died /and it’s just like damn /like it’s just to the point where like /I don’t know /it shouldn’t be like that /it’s not worth it to me anymore
[S20] So is that just like lack of enthusiasm?
[S18] No, it’s not like lack of enthusiasm. It’s just like people /American kids I mean are dying
[S20] But that’s what they signed up for.
[S18] Well I mean it’d be different if we were like /I don’t know /I don’t think /in the long run, I don’t think it’s gonna be worth it to get involved anymore
[S19] Like and they don’t even want our help. They want nothing to do with us. They hate Americans /like why would we help a country
[S20] That’s another media thing
[S18] Well but also like with that /you’re making a good point / I mean we’re sending kids over seas to die /they’ve got the home field advantage and they’re ready to like do whatever it takes /I’m not gonna fall into the stereotypes but they’re willin to do whatever it takes to get us out /and win /and like they [laughter] /I mean it’s just like we’re over there and like we see some video of marines or army dudes throw a flash ring at a flock of sheep as they’re like driving by in Iraq /I mean they’re kids /I mean they’re like playing games over there /I mean I don’t know /I just /the more of what I see over there /there’s a certain extent of things they do to keep themselves sane and to kinda let loose but some of the actions they have done over there /I mean the whole thing with the marines and shooting up the village /that’s awful /I mean /does everyone know about that? /like there’s a 
[S20] When did this happen?
[S18] Naa. It was a big news story. It was over the summer /and even my /my um marine buddy /he said definitely does not look good /a bunch of marines like crapped and shot up a whole town complete with women and kids /it was all over the news /I wish I had 
[S17] For what reason? Do you know?
[S18] It was not a valid reason.  I’m not gonna continue cause I don’t know the /I can’t be like talking out my behind /but it’s just so much scandal /and for everything we don’t know about that goes good /there’s probably just as much stuff we don’t know about that goes on bad over there
[S17] I was gonna say like /I think it’s hard to keep on believing in the war /even as you originally started because you don’t see anything good /like you need positive reinforcement to keep on doing something /and even if you saw no negative and you just saw nothing
[S18] Well I don’t know if that would hold true cause if there was no negative /I mean why not?
[S17] But, why?
[S18] Well, yeah /I mean it’s like why or why not? /That’s the big question, but there’s overwhelming
[S17] And since we see so much negative we just like reject
[S19] Even with the world wars we saw a lot of negative but then we saw them liberating the Jews and stuff like that /like something good came out of it /nothing good is really coming out of this
[S17] And even with the increased troops and stuff /you would expect if things were going well then increased troops would make things better /but since things aren’t going well /there hasn’t been any improvement
[S19] If things were going well, why would they need more troops?
[S17] Yeah, that’s true.
[S18] Even when I wanted /like when I was supporting the war /it’s like even the people who were supporting the war weren’t too completely revamped the way we’re doing things over there /I mean they train the Iraqi policemen /what was it like 2months? /It’s like you’re in and then you’re out, now go police the streets /I mean it’s they don’t have enough time to actually /and I mean if it was at the beginning of the war I’d be like sure let’s like take a minute and sit down and really devise /but I mean we’re already too far into it where it’s just too late man /I don’t know /it’s too late man /but that’s the way I feel about that
[So do you think the war has gone on far enough or do you think that we should continue it?]
[S20] It’s a constant battle within myself I guess you could say. I don’t want Americans over there or anything, but on the other hand /I don’t want everybody just to leave and have them sent home with an emptiness / I guess is what we’re talking about /I wouldn’t want that like /with everybody coming home /I’d want something to big to happen at least before everybody comes back /or bigger than what everybody’s thinking right now
[S17] I think it’s like a pride issue /like you don’t want to
[S20] That’s cause pride’s a very big issue /yeah
[S18] Yeah, yeah /that’s the one thing /I mean there is a very valid point /I mean if we do pull out now /we’re sending like
[S20] Mixed messages
[S18] Well, yeah /we’re saying like yeah the terrorists have won /I mean I hate to over-generalize and use this parallel, but the same thing with Vietnam /I know it’s overused and used incorrectly a lot of the times but it’s appropriate in this case where like it’s just time to say we cannot progress any further without substantial like kickback
[S17] You have to think whether being over there is good for you or bad for you. And, if it’s bad for you, just leave and don’t stick it out
[S18] Well if the bad doesn’t
[S17] Doesn’t outweigh the good /yeah /it’s not worth sticking it out to look like you can handle it
[S20] What do you guys think would happen if Bush /if he did take everybody back? /What do you think the people who hate him right now would like
[S18] Well, they’d still hate him but
[S19] They’d gain more respect for him /I think
[S20] Oh really /cause I think they’d be like oh it’s about damn time /oh we still hate you and you still suck
[S18] Well no /like
[S19] I don’t think /he’s really gone past the point of redemption at this point /he’s already made his mistakes /like he’s not gonna win people back by taking people out
[S18] And it’s not just the war though
[S19] Yeah, he’s done more than just the war.  But /ya know /he should just do something right for once /like
[S20] Well I don’t mean to bring in everything, but he did an amazing job with the economy
[Laughter]
[S18] Are you kidding me?
[S20] No, no, no. Macroeconomics
[S18] Naa /you keep talking about the economy
[S17] There’s more to us than the economy though.
[S20] Very true.
[S18] And even more than the economy /I mean you need /you can’t even like
[S19] Between
[S18] He like drove out /Bush drove two private companies into the ground /bankrupt before he even became President /he also drove his car into a telephone pole drunk
[Laughter]
I mean /he’s not a standup guy
[S19] Between what Clinton did for the economy /compared to what Bush has done for he economy /it just like /like it went down from when he got put into office
[S20] It also takes a long time for stuff to kick in /so sometimes when one President does something
[S19] Yeah but when you’re spending millions of dollars oversea on a war
[S20] Sometimes that takes time
[S19] That isn’t like accomplishing anything /like /we’re not gonna get that money back
[S18] That’s a point, but even at the end of Clinton /I mean the bubble’s about to burst /I mean you can only have economic prosperity for such a long time /but I don’t really think with the war and everything /he didn’t really help that much anyways /it’s not the same thing like in after 9-11 everyone’s like storm Iraq /or storm Afghanistan /find those expletives /it’s not the same 
[S20] It’s not the same what?
[S19] I’m not a huge Bush fan.
[S20] I don’t think many people are huge Bush fans /ya know /I kinda am like sticking out for him, but I’m not a huge Bush fan
[Do you wanna discuss about some of the things that you disagree with that they’ve been saying?]
[S20] I really have nothing to base off of /or not a whole lot to base everything off of so I think I’m gonna 
[S17] Would you vote for Bush again?
[S20] No
[S17] Ok. 
[S18] No, man.
[S19] No. Luckily he can’t run again.
[S20] But would I pick Bush over Hilary? I’d pick Bush.
[S17] Really?
[S20] Yeah /hate Hilary
[S18] I’d /I’d just well
[S20] That’s a different topic
[S17] I think people just hate her personally.
[S18] Well, no /I mean /like she’s /I don’t know /like with the whole thing /I’m from Connecticut /so there’s the whole thing with Joe Lieberman running /as opposed to Ned Lamont /Ned Lamont, yeah /the guy’s like some /I  /yeah, he was running under the whole slogan of actually bringing our troops back /which is /even like in this discussion /I mean that’s not a bad idea /but that’s kinda like all he /all he was about /and so like /he won /he was /he actually won the democratic primary but then Joe ran as an Independent and won /I believe /I think that’s how it worked /yeah I think that’s how it worked /but um / when they were asking Hilary /cause like Bill Clinton /he’s like oh yeah I’m gonna support Joe no matter what /and they asked Hilary who would you support /like depending on who wins the primary /she’s like I’ll support whoever /whoever wins the Democratic primary /and I mean stuff like that is just not /as a moderate I really don’t see a big deal about /I mean party politics are strong to some extent /but you shouldn’t let that define /I mean just cause someone’s a Democrat /that shouldn’t /you shouldn’t like rally behind 
[S20] [inaudible] But, I think we’re straying off topic. Cause that’s kinda goin nowhere.
[S18] Bush /that’s relevant
[S19] I don’t know what else to say about him.
[About the war?] 
[S19] Uhhh / [laughter]
[S18] And that’s all I have to say about that.
[S20] Tryin to like frantically think of something to say.
[Laughter]
[S18] Do you /when George Washington was just a small boy /he had a cherry tree /he chopped down that cherry tree
[S19] Well, I remember reading something /I don’t remember the details because I read it a while ago /about the guy who Bush put in charge of the war like stepped down /remember that?
[S20] Was that just recently?
[S19] Yeah /well it was kinda recent /I don’t know /I think it was before Christmas, but I’m not sure
[S17] Do you know like what happened? 
[S19] Um /I guess like the guy had been wanting to step down for a while but Bush wouldn’t let him cause like as his scapegoat
[S17] Oh my gosh.
[S19] So /like I think Bush knows that he needs to pull the troops, but I don’t think that he wants to admit that he was wrong and 
[S18] It’s not /it’s not even as he needs to pull the troops /if he does something and like drastically revives the way /I mean it still /it still might not convert other people /but 
[S17] At least he’s making an effort to improve
[S18] At least he’s doing something /I mean he’s just kinda yeah send em over
[S17] I think people don’t like him because he can’t admit that he’s wrong /like he thinks that people think he’s not doing enough /so he just does more /but it’s like you’re using the wrong approach and you have to fix that
[S18] I don’t think it’d be very smart for a President just to come out and say oops I messed up /cause I mean to some extent he is the leader and
[S20] Especially since it’s the United States I mean
[S18] But there’s a sly way he could be doing that
[S17] He could try at least.
[S18] There’s a sly way you could like change things so that the political analysts and such could go in and say hey he apologized to us without even saying anything
[S20] Well what would
[S19] I think /I’m sorry /I don’t even think like revising the way he’s approached the war would necessarily make him /like make him have to admit he was wrong /it would just be like oh well let’s try a different approach and see if it’s more effective
[S18] Right. Yeah, exactly. Well I was just saying that’d be more along the lines /if it’s not him saying he messed up /it’s good enough for most if he does that
[S20] If he would say that he messed up like I’m sorry for the war /like what type of effect do you think that would have on America and on the troops?
[S18] That’s /that wouldn’t be a smart move at all
[S20] No, it’d be horrible /but like what type of effect do you guys think?
[S19] I think it would just be like /everyone would be like I knew all along /like 
[S20] I told you so?
[S19] Yeah.
[S20] What about the troops?
[S19] For the troops /they’d probably wouldn’t be so gung-ho to support a country that wasn’t behind them 
[S18] A lot of them don’t believe that this is all for nothing like he was saying earlier /but I mean it’s a point where like 
[S20] Most of em’
[Well do you want to elaborate a little bit more on that?]
[S18] Yeah /I mean like there /like /it’s a shame /cause like as I was saying my buddy /my buddy like all his friends are dyin over /I mean it’s a shame because me and my other friend /we can’t talk to him about the Iraq war cause I mean we have these certain like opinions and it would just like upset him so much /no question /I mean he has his own reasons cause I mean he was born in Iraq and like he came over here when he was like a little tot /and like now he’s /but like /as for like Joe American /I don’t think they have that like vendetta or whatever you would call it to go back and set things right in a foreign country where they have never been before
[S20] Does he have connections over with /people in Iraq /like his family? 
[S18] Yeah
[S20] Like they talk about him /like what’s going on and everything?
[S18] Um 
[S20] Cause that’d be like an interesting perspective
[S18] I don’t know/ I mean like he /his Dad /he says his Dad when he was over there /uh / he was a dentist /and like he /this is a funny thing /he got like a letter from Saddam saying like keep up the good work, you’re being a good dentist
[Laughter]
Like /so that’s like the one funny thing he has /and then um 
[S17] Thank you for being a good dentist. 
[Laughter]
[S18] Yeah it was /I don’t know /it just always struck me as funny /but um no I don’t think they um /he actually was scared /he didn’t even tell his parents he was going over to Iraq the second time /yeah /they don’t know /cause they /yeah
[S17] Oh my gosh.
[S19] Wait, so how do his parents feel like about him being an American soldier?
[S18] Yeah, about that /um 
[S19] Being born in Iraq
[S18] Well, no, cause he thinks that like he’s going back and freeing his people
[S17] Mmhmm. Do they see it that way?
[S18] Yeahhh /like his brother /like hates him /I mean that really /even within his family /that’s a /again we really didn’t get into it cause 
[S20] Touchy subject
[S17] Probably a sensitive issue.
[S18] Yeah /that’s like sayin like so I heard your sister had an abortion /like how’s your folks dealing with that /like /it like /it’s not something that uh /something to make light of at all /like I just did.
[Laughter]
[Do you guys have any other thoughts on this topic?]
[S19] No
[S18] Nope
[S19] Do we have any other thoughts on this topic?
[Ok, end of discussion.]
