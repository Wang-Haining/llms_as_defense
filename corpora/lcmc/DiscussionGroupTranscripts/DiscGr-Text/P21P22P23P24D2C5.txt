GROUP 21222324
CATHOLIC CHURCH

[In your opinion, does the Catholic Church need to change its ways to adapt to life in the 21st century?]

[S21] Yes

[Laughter]

[Any reason why?]

[S21] Um / because / I feel like / everything / that we go by right now in the church / was / made up / thousands of years ago / times have changed / we don’t / stone people anymore / I mean / everything has changed / so I feel like / everything else has to change / or / at least adapt 

[S23] I feel like / it needs to change / because / society has changed so much / and / I’m just gonna use the case of / um / women priests as an example / if women are getting / certain rights in society / like in the workforce and / in everyday life / that they didn’t have / like 100 years ago / and then / in the Catholic Church / they go to church / and their status is exactly the same as it was 1000 years ago

[S21] Uh-huh

[S23] Then / I mean / what does that say?

[S21] The thing is / with that / cause I argued the same thing / and / someone told me that / back then / there were women priests / like

[S23] Really?

[S21] Yea

[S23] Oh

[S21] They were there / they were allowed to be priests / it was just / the reason they were made to be / like / only men or whatever / was the 12 Apostles

[S23] Oh

[S21] So / I mean that / I guess that even falls more on the church / as a flaw

[S23] Yea

[S21] Ya know / I don’t really know

[S23] It’s just / flawed interpretation 

[S21] Yea

[S22] There used to be a lot more gospels too

[S21] Yea

[S23] Yea / [Laughter]

[S22] There used to be a lot of them / and then they’re were like / oh / [inaudible] Luke and john / oh / that’s it / no more / those 4 are it / yea 

[S23] There’s like a whole other bible

[S24] Cause the other ones might not agree with

[S21] Right

[S22] Cause the other ones didn’t agree / or / or cause / there were like specific problems with / um 

[S21] Yea

[S22] Ya know / Dead Sea scrolls

[S21] They were all written / like / at least in the New Testament / they were all written 60 years after

[S23] Yea

[S21] Jesus died / how / accurate can they be

[S23] And most of them are the same [Laughter]

[S22] Yea

[S21] Most are the same

[S22] And / um / ya know / and this / this is just my opinion / and I wouldn’t / and I’m sure that there are like / theology buffs who would / ya know / argue this til the cows come home and hate it / but / I don’t know / I / I think that if you’re gonna talk about the like lessons that we’re supposed to be learning / I think like / ya know / Jesus and St. Peter / and all those people would be like / why are you people even talking about gay marriage and abortion right now / they would just be like / what / why / why are you even worrying about these things when there are so many more / like / pressing issues / to deal with and to think about 
[S23] It’s true.

[S22] Ya know / like / people starving / and war / and poverty / and / just / a lot more [laughter] 

[S21] Yea / that makes sense

[S22] There’s all like injustice / ya know

[S21] Uh-huh

[S21] Church [Laughter]

[S22] Yea / the church

[S23] Yea / any church / um

[S24] No / I can respect them for sticking to / a certain moral code / like / um / if a certain institution / whether it be a church / or / whatever / over time / it/ it’s changing / every chance it gets / every time the society changes / there’s certain aspects that should change / to keep updated with society / and there’s certain things you need to keep as a part of tradition / to keep you / ya know / well grounded / that’s pretty much / like / all I could / respect them for / but as far as / just / somethings like / I heard from a friend / that / the whole idea of eating / not eating meat on Fridays during Lent didn’t even / has like no founding

[S21] Uh-huh

[S24] In any of the early biblical times / it was something to do with / fishing history or something

[S21] Yea / I mean /like / if we’re / if we can

[S23] Yea / I heard that [Laughter]

[S21] Like I feel like if / the Pope can / go ahead and / make age limits for the eating / not eating meat on Fridays

[S23] Yea

[S21] I mean / if we can go ahead and just make up that rule / that / only 19 and over and 55 and below [laughter] have to abide by that rule / then / what is the / I don’t see the point in doing it / I don’t see the / holiness in doing it

[S23] That’s pretty arbitrary

[S21] Yea

[S23] I think it’s funny that like / last year / or whatever / he gave / um / a special exemption cause a Friday in lent happened to be St. Patrick’s Day

[S21] Yea

[S23] So everyone could eat their corned beef [Laughter]

[S21] Yea / like / I mean / if / if / a human has the power to do that / like 

[S23] If it meant that much / just have it on Saturday / yea 

[S22] That’s proof / proof right there / that beliefs and the interpretation of the bible / are just / defined situationally

[S21] Right

[S23] Uh-huh / completely / it’s just used for / whatever it’s needed for

[S22] That they are / yea / and / and 

[S24] Or / sorry / go ahead

[S22] More proof / of that / was like / I mean / you / we / we all learned about this in Western Civ / the divine right of kings / if G-d chose the Pope and the Pope chose the king / G-d chose the king / king can do whatever the hell he wants 

[S23] Yea

[S22] And / ya know / like church’s silent acknowledgment of the Holocaust / like / all these things / just situationally / like / well / ya know / we gotta do this / so / we’re gonna do this / it just doesn’t seem so infallible when you / poke at it like that

[S21] Uh-huh

[S24] Yea / we’re kinda liken the Church to a politician / just in the sense that / they feel like if they / let one of these issues go / realize they need to come up to date / that they think that they’re gonna lose their whole following / like / I think / that they wouldn’t necessarily disagree with some of the changes being called for / but they feel like it would cause a great deal of instability within the church / saying / ya know / oh / you’ve forgotten what it’s all about / and you’re changing / and are you really credible anymore 

[S21] No

[S24] I feel like that’s what / I don’t agree with that / but / I think the leaders of the church might think that it would cause instability 

[S23] Well / that’s true / the good thing and the bad thing about the church is that it’s so so based and absorbed in tradition / I mean / that’s where / that’s where the church comes from / that’s where all the morals come from / that’s where the rights come from / and that’s good / but that’s also where / the obstinate picky little laws / come from / and / and / the / practices / that have been handed down / over the centuries / and gained and gained / and lost their meaning / the farther they get from their origin

[S24] I wouldn’t even agree that all the morals come from / just the Catholic Church

[S21] Yea

[S22] Did you ever play that game telephone?

[S23] Yea / [Laughter]

[S22] Imagine that / but 2000 years old

[S21] Yea

[S23] [Laughter] Seriously 

[S24] Yea / we talked about that in my Theology class / and / and their reasoning behind that 

[Laughter]

[S24] Yea / we talked about that exact example / the telephone game / and their reasoning behind it / is that the Holy Spirit has helped / um / the original message to come across / two millenniums

[S22] Oh / ok 

[Laughter]

[S22] Well / but / the Holy Spirit has also fed poor people all over the world / and / ya know

[S23] Yea

[S24] The Holy Spirit seems like some sort of / I’m sorry / like a / like a fabrication / I don’t see [Laughter]

[S22] Well / the Holy Spirit guided us through the crusades 

[S24] Of course

[S23] Oh / absolutely

[S22] And 

[S23] When G-d told us / we needed to fight those Muslims / we were all over that

[S22] And now / the Holy Spirit is / making sure / we don’t let those gays get married 

[S23] Oh / yea

[S24] Has anybody heard of Nietzsche / um / the philosopher Nietzsche’s view / on Christianity

[S23] What’s that?

[S22] He was an idolist / he believed in nothing

[S24] Well

[Laughter]

[S24] No he didn’t / people translated his works to believe that he did / but / he had this idea that morality was separated into a master morality and slave morality / and that the idea of slave morality / um / is what brought about Christianity / that / um / people who were in oppression and in slave positions / like / um / the Hebrews / like Moses / and them / and / then um / [inaudible] Christians / um / around Jerusalem / that they / were oppressed and they create this whole value system that / those in / like a master / more powerful position 

[S23] Yea

[S24] Are wrong / and since they’re in a weaker position / they / they fabricate these morals to show that / they’re right / and then these morals kind of built the Christian system and they create their own superhero / which is like G-d / to / kind of show them that they’re right / I mean / I’m not saying I agree or not agree / I just think it’s a really interesting idea that / it could have all just been fabricated as a / a / moral belief system

[S21] Yea

[S23] It had to come from somewhere

[S24] To oppose / to oppose / what was facing them at the time

[S21] Yea

[Laughter]

[S21] Is anyone not Catholic here? What?

[S24] Methodist / but / it’s just by / on paper
[S23] Yea

[Laughter]

[S22] Um / I / I like / um / learning about religions more than practicing them

[S21] Uh-huh / ok / interesting / I think that’s important

[S22] I don’t really want to sign my name on the dotted line for one cause I think they’re all equally valuable

[S23] I think it’s funny that we talk about / separation of church and state and how / the government shouldn’t be involved in religious matters [Laughter]

[S22] Alright / I’m gonna stop

[S23] And how / sorry / um / like / it shouldn’t be using religious arguments / but throughout history / like / the church has been so / so overly involved in politics

[S21] Um / yea / [Laughter]

[S23] So / I mean / from both directions

[S24] I think that’s the problem / is so many people have founded their moral beliefs / in their upbringing / within a religious environment / so / it’s kinda hard to separate that / they might not even know they’re doing it / until we get some people from the outside looking in / saying / yea / your belief came from Christianity

[S23] Yea / but / I mean / even like you were saying / the church / the / church appointed / 

[S22] The Pope

[S23] The kings

[S22] Yea

[S23] Of / Europe / [Laughter] / for centuries

[S24] Uh-huh

[S23] Anyone with power had the blessing of the church / and / without that / you were nothing

[S22] But / Galileo 

[S23] Yea

[S22] Copernicus / everyone who wrote right after them had to put disclaimers in their books

[S21] Church is one thing I don’t get a lot out of / like / if I / like I / we used to go all the time when I was little / but / I / I probably haven’t gone / in like 3 years / I just / never got anything out of it

[So / does that have anything to do with / maybe / that maybe they should / um / come into the 21st century and grab the attention of the youth more]

[S21] Yea / definitely / cause I feel like / every year / it was the same stuff / over and over / which it’s always gonna be / um / I don’t know / maybe they could just / change some things about it / to make it more / interesting / more / like / some like / to make you / want to go / cause / I / it was always the same stuff / but I always got the same thing out of it / which was pretty much nothing / and / um / I don’t know / I just / I always like took it elsewhere / like / I would just / like / do other things to practice / I guess / you could say

[S23] Well / it definitely / it definitely depends what parish you belong to / because / I know a lot of places / at least in upstate New York / have started having youth masses / where like / they have / um / like actual bands instead of that one 80 year old woman with the horrible voice / who stands up there and sings / they have like guys on guitar and stuff / and everyone gets really into it / and / even the priest is like / not / using / humongously long sentences / and / going on and on just about the passage / like / I think there’s been a huge effort in a lot of places

[S21] Uh-huh

[S23] To apply like / the teachings more to life

[S21] Yea

[S23] And to get people more involved

[S21] Yea 

[S23] And that should definitely be taking further

[S21] Yea

[S22] In other countries too / I mean / like / a squirming 10 year old kid / isn’t really gonna want to sit in the pew for an hour / and then / kneel on that little thing / and / ya know / very very few kids are really gonna feel like they’re / I mean / cause kids are all like / ok / either I’m enjoying this or I’m not / and I’m not enjoying it / so / kids / it’s gonna be harder to find value in

[S21] Uh-huh

[S23] I actually like church. I think it’s relaxing / I like to meditate / [Laughter] / I don’t / I have to say / I don’t really listen too much to what’s going on / but I like the singing

[Laughter]

[S24] To go back to your point earlier / um / I don’t know / maybe you got this in your Sophomore English / or / supplemental English kind of thing / you read Emerson’s like / Divinity School address / or / anything he’s written on religion / any of you? It’s kinda talking about your idea though / that / um / modern churches / and I guess / the church always has lost / um / certain impersonal touch with / um / the lay people / that you’ve / got somebody up their preaching you / but / what does he really know about you / or what you need for your life / and / so like what Emerson would advocate is / the whole idea of / um / a kind of / not your own G-d / but / you know what you need to develop religiously and spiritually / and / you / only you can know what’s inside / and what you need / so you need to take a certain amount of self-reliance / and / 

[S21] That’s also kinda going against / like / what the church is saying / cause / G-d sort of is / supposedly / able to / know what’s / best or what’s going on with everyone / and / I don’t know

[S22] I think a lot / a lot of what we’re saying though is grounded in the types of churches we grew up going to

[S21] Uh-huh

[S23] Yea

[S22] And the types of things that we saw / but / in a lot of / other / kinds of communities / in a lot of other kinds of faiths / like / Christianity is like a tree trunk / with a billion and one branches / like / in Jamaica their masses are like fun / and / everyone’s all up on their feet / and it’s great / and / in / ya know / Baptist churches / in the south / or even in Southern Baptist churches in the north / people are all up on their feet / people are having fun / ya know / in all these / like / mystic religions / people all speak in tongues and all this stuff / and / even / ya know / like / there’s a guy downtown that gets 18,000 people to come to his church / once a week / it’s in an arena because he’s like / the sickest speaker ever [Laughter] / and he gives the best speeches / and / ya know / it really impacts people / and / all / although the church has done a lot of bad / like / I think it kinda has to be taken with a grain of salt / because they / although / I mean / it / it’s people to people / cause the church is only gonna be as good as the people who are doing it / so like / if there’s a missionary center set up in El Salvador / I think / it’s only gonna be as good as the people who are there staffing it / but / like / they do do a lot of good stuff / like / social service wise / ya know / just going into a neighborhood where people might / or a neighborhood area country mountainside / wherever / where people / feel like they don’t have a lot going on / they don’t have / ya know / a lot of positive things in their life / and / and giving them some kind of faith / ya know

[S21] Uh –huh

[S22] Just usually it’s Christian faith / and they’re like / now change everything you’re doing and do this instead 

[S21] Yea

[S22] Or at least try

[S24] Do you necessarily need / to be speaking / or acting from some G-d / to / cause that sort of change

[S22] No

[S24] Certainly / I know / I’m not saying I disagree with you or anything

[S22] Yea

[S24] I’m just presenting the idea that / I mean / people ever think about that / you don’t / I mean / like you said / you’re going and changing somebody else’s belief system / do you necessarily need to take this to them / this is the way to believe / this is gonna help you and give you faith

[S22] I / I think you don’t / and I think you shouldn’t / because / a certain altruistic / dimension to that type of work / is then gonna be lost in what you’re doing / because / you’re going there in a self-serving way / to try and / ya know / service your faith somehow / with some sort of superiority to theirs / so / even though that is a downside / and even though that is really troubling to me / every time I’ve seen it / which is just about any place you’ll travel to / where it’s going on / um / they at least deserve credit / because / they’re doing something / and they’re doing more than most other people / and they’re doing more than almost any other single organization / and they’re / and / and / like / a very very substantial portion of / of agencies which are really out there for social justice issues / are faith based / which for me / who’s definitely not a Christian person / it’s difficult / but like / I can still get over that and work with them because these are the agencies which are the most established / and which have the most / kind of social service infrastructure / even if it is / not entirely altruistic / and they are just trying to propagate / and proselytize / and whatever

[S23] Yea / well / faith inspires people

[S22] Yea / to do good things or bad things / but / a lot of times good things too

[So / um / regarding all of the accusations against Catholic priests / dealing with pedophilia / do you think these could have been prevented if the Church changed? In any way / by allowing female priests or / allowing priests to marry]

[S23] I don’t think so

[S21] I mean / unless / unless they were / unless the priests acted / like that / because of / how strict they might have been in the church / or something / I mean / maybe that would have helped / but / if a priest is gonna be sick like that / he’s gonna be sick like that / I mean / that’s not that churches fault

[S23] I think

[S24] Well / it kinda seems like / it seems / it can’t be just a coincidence / that all those priests did it / it must have something to do with their background / is it their chaste / or

[S22] They need an outlet for sexual frustration

[S24] Exactly

[S23] Yea / I agree / I think / but / I think / um / you see / like / a disproportion number of priests / or whatever / becoming pedophiles / because / number one / if they have that tendency / they’ve just been put in / this great position / with authority over small children / number two / I think / I think / um / they’re not necessarily bad people / and a lot of people who feel like / the tendencies of pedophilia / would become priests / to try and control that / the same way a lot of homosexual people used to / to / try and combat their urges or whatever / if they strongly believe that as a Christian this was wrong  / and I shouldn’t be feeling this way

[S21] Hm

[S24] I don’t really feel that / the tendency / um / came necessarily afterward / or / I’m sorry / the tendency did come afterwards / and it’s not like / they / um

[S21] Went in with it

[S24] Right / I think / um / how they were brought up / just living the life in the church / that’s what kinda may have / I don’t think it’s necessarily that they have that / tendency / and then they get in this position of power and use it / cause / it just seems like there’s way too many examples that happen / I mean / sure you’re gonna have a couple of priests / yea / and maybe that just was the way they were / but / so many / it just / has to be more than a coincidence

[S22] Do you think human beings or inherently / or / do you think that being / celibate / and not procreating / is / somehow contrary to human nature? Like that humans are inherently sexual beings / and then / this creates some kind of imbalance

[S24] It kind of seems even contradictory to the Catholic Church / just [inaudible] / that’s what they wrote

[S22] Whole procreation?

[S21] Yea

[S22] And to do it / I don’t think they have to live this life of chastity

[S23] I think it is / I think it’s a really / I mean / I understand that it’s supposed to / enhance a man’s concentration on his faith / and like / give him more time to think about G-d instead of / his sexual urges and his wife or whatever / and his family / but / I mean / are / we / we’re supposed to find G-d

[S24] Exactly

[S23] In everything / and / I mean / I think it would help the Catholic Church a lot / for priests to have a better understanding of what goes on in the families of their parishioners / and

[S21] Uh-huh

[S23] To be able to understand that too / because / um / at my old church we had a deacon who gave / homilies a lot / and he was married and he had grandkids / and it was great to hear him tell stories about them and everything / and I mean / it was great / he gave great sermons 

[S21] I’ve heard / like they didn’t / that they didn’t want / priests to get married / and / have families / because / there was the no way that the church could pay for that / there’s / no way that the church could support all these families for all these priests / for each parish / so / that’s what I’ve heard / that was one / reason why / I think the church was against that

[S22] Well / I’ve met a lot of / celibate priests and nuns who were really awesome and who were really cool people / and / I’ve also met a lot of them who are just / messed up /

[S21] Uh-huh

[S23] Uh-huh

[S22] In the head / like / people who are just like / 50 / who are just / and act like they’re out of their minds / just / in the way they communicate 

[S23] Uh-huh

[S21] Yea

[S22] like / I / I saw this one nun who ran / um / a / kinda like a boarding school or quote unquote / troubled children / in a third world country / and / she was / she was just nuts / she was out of her mind / she would be smacking the kids / and stuff / and this is a nun

[S21] Yea

[S22] And / and / I / I / I just saw / I came to see her / like / by the end of the day / and it’s just like / this big angry bag of sexual frustration [Laughter] that was taking it out on these little boys / and I was just like / what is this / like / ya know

[S21] My friend / actually / right after high school / he went into the brotherhood / and / he was there for / about a month and a half / and he had to leave / because / just like you said / the way they act / the way they communicate / some of them / some of them were great / but some of them were just so weird / and the things they would yell at him for / like just / doing certain things wrong / like / it was just out of control / like / he was like / it’s nothing like I ever thought it would be

[S22] Well / you have to retreat into your own little world

[S21] Exactly

[S22] Because you’re giving up a very substantial part of / a part of the world

[S21] Like their dogs or like their best friends / and like / they’re / like some of them were just really weird / so / that was an interesting experience

[S23] Yea / I think they can mess you up

[S21] Yea

[Laughter]

[S23] Especially / I mean / I know they have like a probation period or wherever where you go and tryout / the whole / celibate thing and living as monk / or as / like a priest / and / but / I mean / you can’t predict what doing that for like / 50 years of your life is gonna be like

[S21] Right

[S23] I don’t think that really prepares people

[S22] And watching everyone else go through it

[S23] Yea

[S22] And some / and somehow being in a position of moral authority over them / where they come to you / asking you for guidance about things like this / and you’re just like / yea / well / Lord says that

[Laughter]

[S22] I know a lot priests who are alcoholics

[S21] Yup / that’s another big deal

[S22] Who are raging alcoholics / people who are like very high-functioning alcoholics / like / they’ll get absolutely hammered at dinner / every single night / drinking like [inaudible] alcohol / and then get up and do a mass at 5 in the morning / and just be like fine with it / just cause / they drink a lot / and even / I’ve heard people say that they’ve just come to terms with / they’re like when G-d wants me / he’ll take me [Laughter] / sitting there / like smoking cigarettes / drinking / like / crazy stuff like that

[S21] That’s what my friend said / the biggest / part of / their like / little / house thing / was their / like bar area [Laughter] Like they had a whole / like / it was huge / and they would let him / they would let him drink

[S23] Wow

[S21] Yea

[S23] I have to say / I never / really thought about that before 

[S24] Yea / I’ve heard that / they’re big drinkers in the Catholic Church 

[S21] Yea

[S22] But / I mean / our / our experiences / are like / the American Catholic Church

[S21] Yea

[S22] And there’s Catholicism everywhere / and there’s Islam everywhere / and / Shintoism and Buddhism and / all those other stuff / all over the place / which / ya know / you really can’t come up with an argument that any one is more or less valuable than the others / so / I feel like / the only way that anyone could really be / like / a true anything / would be to know / and compare and contrast to the other ones / because / if you don’t know anything / about / Islam / then / how do you not know that it doesn’t call you and that you don’t feel more spiritually fulfilled / or visa versa / like / if you’re / if you grew up Muslim / and / you don’t know anything about Judaism / and then all of a sudden / you meet / some Hebrew dude who all of a sudden / I know with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict / that sounds unfeasible / but / like / it really is

[S23] Yea / I think not enough people question their faith / and that’s why / we get into arguments / based on / the letter of the law / like / with homosexual couples

[S21] Uh-huh

[S23] Cause people aren’t / looking at it / from all directions / and trying to see it from other people’s point of view / they’re just / this is what I believe / and this is what the bible says / so

[S21] Uh-huh

[S23] I think / if you ask them / to / tell you in a vacuum / why they thought this was wrong / why they thought women shouldn’t be priests

[S21] They take it too literally

[S23] They wouldn’t be able to tell you / with / their own reasons

[S21] Uh-huh

[S22] Because it’s wrong

[Laughter]

[S23] Cause / it says

[S22] The bible says / we’ll all go to hell

[Laughter]

[S22] And / and the reason that they would probably say / is because / there are no women priests in the bible

[S23] Right

[S22] Well / not / not they / I mean / you really can’t generalize like that / by bad / but like / the reason why / I think a lot of people would say / a lot of people would contend

[S23] Yea

[S24] There’s also a lot of differences between then and now [Laughter] / cultural differences / which just comes back to / the very question we’re supposed to be answering

[S21] Uh-huh

[S23] Yea / yea / that’s true / not only was it a different time period / it was a different culture

[S21] Uh-huh

[S23] So

[S21] It was on the other side of the world

[S23] Which makes it even harder to say that the Catholic Church needs to change / cause / there’s still Catholics over on that side of the world. Maybe it’s too global for its own good

[Laughter]

[S23] Things are so different in difference places

[S21] Hm / it’s hard to keep it universal

[S23] Yea

[S22] That’s what Catholicism means though

[S23] Yea / it’s so hard

[S24] I know / that’s what it’s supposed to do 

[S22] Universal

[S23] Yea / but / honestly / like / 99% of Catholics know nothing about / like Catholicism in like / Africa / or / or / the Middle East / or Asia

[S22] Or / they just don’t even about Catholicism / they just go through the motions / like cafeteria Catholics

[S23] Right

[S22] You ever heard that term?

[S24] Uh-huh

[S23]  I mean / much less / much less / from knowing about other religions / and / understanding their value systems / and / I mean / they don’t even know what different Catholics / think / I think if the Catholic Church is gonna remain / like / universal and global / it / it needs to do some educating to bring all its pieces together

[S21] Uh-huh

[Just want to throw out final / thoughts / on the issue / sum up your ideas]

[S22] I read this thing / by the Pope / in like 1986 / I think it was / or some / some year / this big long papal thing / called / Gaudi in [inaudible] / that said that it was the church’s / the church needed to / be dynamic / so that it could / the church needed to be dynamic so that it could fully engage in an ever changing world / I think is what it said / or so that it could fully engage with an ever changing world / like / I don’t know / how / do / things that were written in the Middle East 2000 years ago / translate to a global economy now for instance

[S21] Uh-huh

[S23] Yea

[S22] Because / I don’t know / the same people who that gay rights and all that stuff is really bad / aren’t really looking at / a lot / other really horrible injustices / which / just / attention isn’t really called to as much / or which they’re apathetic towards / on a global scale

[Ok.]
