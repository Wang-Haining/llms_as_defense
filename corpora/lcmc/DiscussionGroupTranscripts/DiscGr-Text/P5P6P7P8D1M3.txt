MARIJUANA 

[Are you guys ready to begin?]

[Ok. The city of Denver has decided to legalize small amounts of marijuana for person’s over 21. How do you feel about this? Who would like to begin? Anyone have a thought?]

[S5] Kevin

[Laughter]

[S8] Oh / pick me out of the crowd / um / yea / I’d say it’s about time [Laughter] I mean / in all  honesty / come on / we can’t / we can’t push it back that far / it’s like one of those drugs that’s out there / it’s / so popular / I mean / you see it among / like / I mean / I think / what were the statistics? It’s like more than 50% of all high school students have tried marijuana / like / it’s just something that you can’t really hold back / I mean / especially our generation / and / the generation before this / with like / like / I don’t know / the hippies and all of that / and / when it first started really coming into play in American culture / ever since then it’s just been slowly progressing and now / like / I mean / it almost seems like it’s almost a regular thing now / like / you talk to somebody who smokes pot / oh / they’re just this guy who smokes pot / you don’t really like seem them in any different light than you would like a different person / and like / unless you’re taking a really strong stance against it / and all that

[S7] I feel it’d be good / it’d be nice so that way / I mean / it’s / people / a lot / a lot of like / today’s like legal systems they spend their whole time worrying about everyone and this pot thing and everyone and this marijuana thing / and weed / and I’m like / you have other bigger things to do / there are bigger things out there than this weed thing / and / I mean / 21 is a good age / 21 is like

[S8] Yea / perfect

[S7] Did you say 21 or 25? 

[S8] 21

[21]

[S7] Ok / 21 is / I mean / it’s a good age / you’re an adult / you kinda know what you’re doing / if you’re like any other teenage out here / you’ve been doing it since you’re in high school [Laughter] / so / it’s not that big of a deal

[S8] Yea / if there’s anything you really want to work out / it’s drinking / I mean / drinking’s a lot worse than smoking marijuana / for / I mean / you don’t really hear of someone smoking a joint and then getting in a car and getting into / like / a three car accident

[S7] Yea

[S8] Like killing the passenger or something

[S6] Yea / I don’t know any angry potheads. 

[S7] Huh?

[S6] I don’t know any angry potheads / I know a lot of angry drunks.

[S7] Yea / they’re very laid back / very nice people [Laughter]

[S6] And I mean / even the health effects of it / like / they’re not that much more detrimental than regular cigarettes / and I think like even more marijuana is less detrimental / than cigarettes

[S8] Yea / I think studies have actually begun to shown / show / that / um / marijuana smoke doesn’t cause / um / lung cancer / like / tobacco smoke does / I think what it really has to do with in tobacco is the chemicals and all of that / whereas / that they / that cigarette companies put into it / whereas marijuana / I mean / it’s just like all natural pretty much

[Laughter]

[S7] It’s pure

[S6] I think one of the reasons the government’s been afraid / well the federal government has been afraid to touch the issue is that they can’t tax it

[S8] Exactly

[S6] And they can’t control its trade at all 

[S5] Ha

[S6] It’s considered part of the underground economy / and / since they can’t make any money off of it / and since they can’t have any control over its distribution / they really just want to ban it out right

[S7] That’s a good point / like / I didn’t really think about that

[S5] Yea

[Laughter]

[S5] I didn’t know that

[How do you feel about legalizing it?]

[S5] Oh / I don’t think it should be legalized / but / I didn’t even know that / I didn’t realize that / um / cigarettes / had / or / smoking marijuana / you couldn’t get cancer / like lung cancer

[S8] Yea / well / it’s / I mean / it hasn’t been engraved in stone yet / but / they’ve been doing studies and these studies have been showing that / like / people who have been smoking marijuana their entire life / haven’t / developed all of these lung illnesses that people have been smoking cigarettes all of their life have

[S7] And isn’t like / isn’t like weed / like / it’s good for some

[S6] Glaucoma

[S7] Yea / some / some diseases people have, it’s good for it / um / weed is good for them / it helps them out / so

[S8] Yea / especially when you look at cancer and all of that / like / I think it’s needless to say that smoking marijuana increases your appetite / and / that’s one problem they have with cancer patients because they won’t eat because cancer causes your appetite to suppress itself 

[S7] Yea

[S8] And basically / you can’t eat anything / and that just kinda ruins your body even more than the cancer is / so getting them to eat kinda helps them to stay strong / and live longer / so you can look at its medical benefits and all of that

[S7] I think if they really do / like / think about it / it must be / what you said / that / they just don’t know how to tax it / they don’t where it’s coming from and all the other type / I think that if they got a hold on it they wouldn’t mind it as much

[S8] And I think problem is / um / you have all these like older people in power and all of that / and / like / back when they grew up / they had videos like Reefer Madness and all of that

[S6] Such a funny movie

[S8] Yea / if you watch something like that and you just watch it and think about how ridiculous that is / like / you look at the actual facts behind like / about marijuana / like / and / in Reefer Madness / like / um / some guy smokes a joint / gets in a car / gets in a hit and run accident and just drives away like cracking up / like / come on / if someone who was high did that they’d probably freak out / they would not be happy in that situation at all / chances are they probably wouldn’t even drive because they’d be too paranoid

[S7] Yea

[S8] And plus / the high isn’t really as intense as the drunk is / so / and it doesn’t boost your ego so you don’t think / oh / I can handle this / I can get behind the wheel and get home safe / without hitting any dogs or children on the way / sorry I had to use those examples / but

[Laughter]

[S8] Something extreme

[S7] That’s a good point because you don’t really hear about people that are like / like / drunks / I mean / you hear about drunks that just / well / when I do it / I’ll like / I’m more of a laidback, tipsy person / so I’m gonna leave it at that

[Laughter]

[S7] So I don’t do / I mean / I’m just scared of / the whole / driving drunk think / so I would never do that / but / if you do hear about people that all of a sudden as soon as they get drunk they get real loud and real boisterous and all this other type of stuff / and then when you see people that are smoking weed / they’re like / hey

[S8] You see people who are smoking weed / you walk in on them / they’re probably sitting down with like bag of Doritos watching Animal Planet or something

[S7] [inaudible] It’s funny

[S8] Or watching like Cartoon Network / I don’t see any danger in that / I mean / I’ve never heard of someone whose smoked up and then like / busted up / like busted a cops windshield / and then ran away or something like that / you don’t really hear about all this violence like you do with alcohol / you always hear about someone who’s drunk / like / if you watch like Cops or something / they always have to deal with these drunks who are out there / they’re like / they get really angry, they start fighting / they / some punches are thrown and then the next thing they know they’re in the jail cell

[S7] Yea

[S6] I think traditionally / weed has been identified with the counter-culture too / like / there’s a stereotype associated with it / it’s always hippies or [inaudible] or whatever that are doing it / where as alcohol is kind of ubiquitous

[S7] Yea

[S6] And I think that’s kind of a double standard / because / I mean / frankly I’d rather deal with / if I were cop / I would rather have to deal with a high person than a drunk person

[And you said you didn’t want to / I’m sorry / you said you didn’t think that it should be legalized? Do you still think that or are you starting to change your mind? Do you / kinda want to give your reasons why?]

[S5] Um
[Cause you seem to be differing a little bit from what everyone else is saying / so]

[Laughter]

[S5] Um / no / my mind hasn’t really changed / about it / I don’t know / how / why I have that / opinion

[S7] Do you have like experiences with it / that made you feel like / weed is not [inaudible]

[S5] What?

[S7] Have you had like experiences with it? Or / like / not experiences / like / per you / per say / or like your friends / or

[S5] Experiences with weed / why wouldn’t I want it to be legalized?

[S7] Yea

[S5] Um / I’m just not big on any form of smoking / at all

[S8] Ok / that’s a pretty simple answer

[S5] And / um / I don’t know / my grandpa just died of lung cancer so I was kinda / more / but that’s why I found it interesting that you / said / it doesn’t have that type of effect

[S8] Yea

[S5] But even before that / I was kinda just against / smoking / in general

[S7] So you’re more of / like you prefer drinking rather than smoking / or / you’re against that too

[S5] Um / I’m not against / smoking / or drinking / or what people want to do / but me personally / like I don’t find the need to / smoke / and drinking / um / not in excess

[S7] Yea / don’t think in excess

[S8] Yea / I went last night to [inaudible] Had to carry him back

[Laughter]

[S7] And more / I think is drinking is more of like the thing you do out in the open / and / if you really think about it / I mean / like / if you get high you get high in like a closed room

[S8] Uh-huh yea / yea / you’re gonna be

[S7] You may go out / the only time you really go out when you’re high is to get food cause you get hungry

[S8] You either get food or you go on a walk through the woods or something

[S7] Yea

[S8] You do something fun.

[S5] Was marijuana always illegal?

[S8] Um / no / actually not / um / it’s actually / George Washington did have a hemp field 

[S5] Oh / so that far back [Laughter]

[S8] It’s / it’s not / not to say that he smoked it or anything but just to say / he had a hemp field / I mean / hemp was a crop that used to manufacture clothing off at / but just the fact that the plant was legally grown on U.S soil

[S7] That’s funny / very interesting

[S8] And plus / there’s other countries / I mean / look over in / um / in the Netherlands, Amsterdam / probably the biggest / pretty much the biggest like potheads dream

[S7] Uh-huh

[S8] So you

[S5] It’s legal there?

[S8] Yea / it’s legal there / they have cafes where you can just go in, buy weed, and / just sit down, relax, and smoke

[S7] In Jamaica / they do it / the Rastafarians

[S5] Yea

[S7] They’re kids smoke weed / it was in my psychology textbook [Laughter]

[S5] I think I saw that / picture / actually / now that you say it

[So do you think that the effects of marijuana are similar at all to alcohol / that it should be legal maybe?]

[S6] I don’t think there’s very much similar / similar to alcohol / but I think they’re / a lot / less detrimental and a lot less / um / intense than alcohol is / so / which is why I feel that it should be legal because / what am I saying / what am I saying? Ok / because alcohol you have all these things like drunk people / I mean / they get aggressive, they go crazy, they get behind the wheel and all of that / whereas high / or being high it’s like a completely different experience / it’s more of you just want to sit back, relax, and / just kind of enjoy your time / you don’t want to be hassled by all these / like / like / um / daily occurrences of / I don’t know / like / someone getting up in your face and trying to fight you / you just kinda want to kick back and do your own thing

[S5] Yea / I agree / I think the effects of alcohol are worse than the effects of marijuana 

[How so? Can you elaborate a little bit on that?]

[S5] Um / well / like / basically just what / was said before / you don’t hear / like Kevin said / you don’t hear about a high person getting into a car accident but you hear about someone drunk getting into a car accident / I think it just / does a lot more to people / where they think they are / all powerful and can do anything / and / I don’t think people who are high really have that / effect/ sometimes it brings people more down / it seems / than up

[S8] Yea / it’s really a / completely different experience / I mean / there’s / there are those similarities / I mean / the similar being it’s a different experience than the regular mindset / you’re kind of out of it / you get zoned out / um / yea / if your group of friends or buddies or whatever / that you like to get with / and / I don’t know / drink or smoke / but then / um / alcohol is / like / the effects of alcohol are blurred vision / um / I don’t know / slurring your words / stumbling because you’re all dizzy and / out of it / completely out of it / whereas being high it’s like / just kind of / lights are / appeal to you a lot more / um / sounds appeal a lot more / you just want to listen to some music / watch some tv / or even just like put on some music and put on like / something that / with lots of colors / that just go everywhere / it’s just / more relaxed / relaxing than like / oh / let’s go run around the street naked or something like that / it’s more of let’s just sit here and sit / and stare at the wall for a couple of minutes [Laughter] 

[S5] In my philosophy class / um / my professor would always talk about how / um / like the great thinkers would always use drugs / as like / that window to / they just like came out with / like these ideas / and / just / that type of thing

[S8] Yea / it’s true / um / marijuana stimulates creativity / which makes / I don’t know / you talk to anybody who’s high / they always have these like far off concepts

[S7] Crazy ideas

[S8] Or whatever / they just go out on their own / they take their own little mind / like / wherever they want to go / and

[S5] I don’t think alcohol does that to anybody / [Laughter]

[S8] No / alcohol makes you / more stupid I guess

[S5] Yea

[S8] You could say that / put it into that light / you don’t really think too much / you just think / oh / I need another drink

[S5] Uh-huh

[S8] I don’t like this song / I’m gonna change it 

[S5] Yea

[How do you feel about legalizing marijuana?]

[S6] I’d be ok with it. Um [Laughter] / I don’t know if that should be legalized to be grown / I think that should be regulated / but / I think / I / I like the Denver law to be honest / being able to carry it in small amounts / cause that’s not an excessive amount

[S8] Yea

[S6] They’re not carrying like bricks of it in the back of their car / or anything / and selling it to school children / but / um / I mean / that’s a reasonable amount to carry

[S8] And plus / I think if you legalize it / you’re definitely going to reduce the crime a lot / and / if you legalize it for people who are over 21 and all of that / I mean / you see it coming out in like high schoolers / like / those people who are not even 10 yet and they’ve probably smoked marijuana / before in their life / and that’s kind of scary / I mean / thinking that they’re getting into stuff like that / at that early of an age / rather than when they have time to think about it / because / all that outside pressure / where as if they were to / like / I mean / if you / if you look at statistics for drinking / the drinking age used to be 18 / they upped it to 21, what happened? Drinking under the age of 21 in excess increases and like there’s more occurrences of / people who are / under 21 getting sent to the hospital for drinking way too much 

[Yea / so what do you think about that? Any response to what he just said about]

[S6] Well / yea / I think that’s true to a certain extent / um / I’ve / like / I’ve known a lot of people who’ve smoked pot obviously because I’m 19 / that’s what people do [Laughter] um / but I’ve never known anybody who I would consider to have / to have like abused pot / or have / to have used in excess / like / a lot of my friends smoke once or twice a week / and / I know a couple of people whose grades its affected / but / frankly / I mean / that’s just overindulging / I don’t / and I still don’t think that’s necessarily abuse / I don’t think that’s the same thing

[S8] Yea / you could do that with like video games or something / you could play too many video games and 

[S6] Yea / exactly / one of my friends failed out of college because he spent all his time playing video games

[Laughter]

[S8] I hate when people try to throw out these stereotypes / of like / oh / your stereotypical pothead / lazy, sits back, does nothing with their life / they just live off their parents money / and / don’t get a job or any of that stuff / because / I mean / it’s really / you can say / I mean / you’d have to say that about like anybody who does anything that / just for recreational use like drinking and all of that / that would mean like / oh / he drinks? He’s an alcoholic then. Like just saying that / something like that / like saying they depend on it / I mean / cause / I know plenty of potheads and / like / some of them are really smart people / like / they’re some of the smartest people I’ve ever known in my life / and they just 

[S6] One of my best friends in high school actually / and I can verify this cause I was in on this SAT session / he came to the SATs stoned and he got a 1590 / that’s probably the exception to the rule cause he was really super intelligent / but / that actually happened

[Any other thoughts?]

[S5] Not really.

[In general?]

[S5] I don’t know / I think everybody has their own opinion / and / that’s the thing / and has it’s ups and downs

[S8] Oh / oh / wait / on the topic of taxation / I think that it would be possible to actually tax it if they were to legalize growing it / and if they were to legalize growing it then of course they’d have to regulate it

[S6] Yea

[S8] I mean / there’d be certain farms that would have to be part of the economy / I mean / farms that like / I mean / you’d even see like / regular farmers that like whatever / they always have like a stand set up where they’re selling their corn or something like that

[S6] I think the problem they’d have though with that / it’s hard to keep people who aren’t necessarily licensed to grow it from growing it / ya know?

[S8] Yea / that’s true

[S6] I mean / if they can’t regulate

[S8] But then / again / you also have to look at beer companies / and all that / people who are making liquor

[S6] A lot of people brew it in their basement

[S8] Yea

[Laughter]

[S8] If moonshining / even people are thrown into jail / I mean / and even people who are just buying it for people who shouldn’t have it

[S6] Uh-huh

[S8] And it would / it would probably have a good impact on the economy / I mean / it’s such a popular item nowadays and even back in like the 60s and 70s / that / if they were to legalize it and start selling it / with tax / I mean / they’d make a profit off of it / they could probably decrease the national debt a lot / and all of that

[Yea / do you want to make talk about the possible positives a little bit more?]

[S8] Ok / um / with / along with the taxation of that / um / I had something that I wanted to say a couple of seconds ago and it just walked out of mind

[Do you feel like it might be a positive thing based on what you were saying / about taxing it?]

[S5] Um / I honestly don’t know enough / about / the economy / to / comment / on it / about its effects and whatnot / to against

[S8] Yea / like / I mean / you do have the problems with like the people / of course / who are gonna be growing on their own and like selling it for their own profit rather than for like / rather than having it taxed / but / that occurs so much like everywhere else / I mean / like with things like Napster and that whole case / people were just downloading music from this one program for free / and / they weren’t paying taxes on it or anything / and that became an issue / so

[S6] Uh-huh

[S8] Like they had to deal with that / so / what’s the big / what makes it an even bigger hassle to deal with like these people who are growing it illegally / I mean / it’s not that hard to spot a giant field filled with marijuana plants [Laughter] if you’re driving by that

[S6] Yea

[S8] You’re gonna be like / oh / that’s marijuana

[S6] Unless you’d grow them hydroponically

[S8] Yea / that’s true / but that’s why they have helicopters with infrared

[S6] Yea / actually / the supreme court ruled against that 

[S8] Really?

[S6] When it came before the Supreme Court

[S8] It’s an invasion

[S6] Yea / it’s an invasion of privacy / you have to have a warrant to use the infrared / cause apparently there was a case where cops without a warrant just put the infrared on a house and they detected them / at the / it’s the heating lamps they actually detect

[S8] Yea 

[S6] For the plants / and they came before the Supreme Court and they said no / you can’t do that / you need a warrant

[S5] Yea / it’s true

[S8] And then they probably had to throw that entire case out

[S6] Yea / they did / got tossed

[S8] Sucks

[S6] I don’t know / it’s their own fault

[Laughter]

[Another other thoughts about legalizing marijuana?]

[S5] No

[No? Ok. End of interview]
