GROUP 1234
CATHOLIC CHURCH
[OK. Everyone’s ready? In your opinion, does the Catholic Church need to change its ways to adapt to like in the 21st Century? And, who would like to begin? Anyone have any ideas?]
[S2] Um /I think it’s important for them to modify their policies since there’s so many /or there’s such a shortage of priests /but, at the same time they have to measure how much change they really wanna do because I mean for them to stay constant is really important /because it’s such a large like institution /global
[S3] Um /what are you suggesting that they change? Like do you mean that they allow women into be priests?
[S2] Well, um
[S3] Or you just mean general changes?
[S2] Well, yeah. Some changes like /like that /that wouldn’t effect essential like theology of the Catholic religion /but would appeal more to like modern society
[S4] They /they have changed in the past /I mean look at Vatican two. They changed the mass from Latin to /uh /ya know /any language /so I mean it’s been shown that they can change /so /I think that they should let priests marry for one
[S1] I think so too.
[S3] I agree with that.
[S2] Yeah /I mean I would agree with that. I’m just not sure why /um /that’s there in the first place /or what’s the like origin for that /I mean that might be important to Catholics to keep that /I mean I’m Catholic but I’m not even sure why like priests can’t marry
[S3] Well /ya know /it was always a pledge of celibacy /it was modeled after Jesus who was celibate /so I think that’s the main reason
[S1] They’re supposed to be married to God.
[S3] Right
[S1] Not have any other marriage in their life /so that’s what it stems off of. However, I think the Vatican two /off of what you said /um /was extremely successful /I mean it opened up a lot of /ya know younger ages were more willing to /ya know /like my father said when he used to sit through a Latin mass /he had no idea what was going on and it was just words to him
[S3] Yeah, I wouldn’t know what was going on either.
[S1] Right /one of those same things /so I think that was necessary /and how long ago was that? /I think that /and how much has changed since Vatican two? /So I think it needs to be re- /ya know /examined /the changes that they made
[S3] I think they may have lost a lot of following even /because like people /like you were saying /like our parents’ generation were sitting through a mass they didn’t understand /why would they feel like they had to believe anything that they didn’t understand? And, I mean and even so I feel like there’s been less of a /I don’t want to say following but I don’t have a better word /um /like my grandfather /like the way that he looked at priests was that they could do no wrong /was that they were really like the highest people in society basically /and I feel like as much as some people still do hold those /it’s not as well /it’s not as widely /I feel like you wouldn’t meet very many people who would say that they thought that those people were the top of everyone in society
[S4] I also think the church should /I don’t know maybe modify some of its doctrines /cause as of now they uh believe that if you’re not baptized then you can’t be saved /I mean that kinda excludes a whole lot of people from 
[S2] Well, you have to take it from the perspective /I mean like in theology class /I had like the same question and my teacher explained it to me /how the church /like if you take the view of the church as in everything they’re talking about and everything in the Bible /all their teachings /if you take em to be true then you’re gonna want to like save everyone you can /like Baptize everyone  you can in order to save them /so I mean that /to make them change like doctrines like that /like that would effect /I mean I think that would effect their central belief /like things like Vatican two /it appealed more to the followers to Catholicism /I think why they’re so /I think why the church is so I guess wary or whatever to change /um /like allowing priests to get married and having female priests is because that’s changing more of like the church and like the inner workings of the church /than just like changing like a ritual of like mass /just to appeal to more people
[S4] Do you think if they don’t change then like you’re gonna run out of priests?
[S2] I mean yeah that is a possibility though /that’s why they have to /it’s kinda like a balancing act
[S4] Yeah
[S3] Well, and I think like /ya know /the boys who graduated with me from /ya know /high school or ya know grade school /not one of them ever talked about being a priest /and nobody I ever knew /I haven’t met anyone near my age that has dedicated their life to that where it used to be at least a couple people would think about it or /ya know being a nun or something /so I think that’s changed a lot
[S1] I feel like that’s been completely declining too /where I’m sure at some point that was like the hot thing to do /kinda thing /like everyone wanted to /and now I can’t name one person who I know who wants to do that
[S2] Yeah /I mean nowadays it’s so much more like lazy /like I mean if you want to be Catholic you could just become Catholic /I mean in medieval times /like also in theology my teacher /good teacher /he uh said how you had to go through this whole process of being Catholic where it would take like years of like study and everything /and also I think /I’m not sure if this is true /um /I don’t know around what time period /I’m just gonna say around medieval times again /um /at least like one child from like a family would like be entered into a monastery or something like that /like I feel like /like nowadays there’s nothing like that /I mean if a son were to say he’s gonna become a priest the parents would go nuts most likely
[S3] And even so /of all the people like I’m thinking of /of all my friends and people from home or at school /of all the people who aren’t Catholic /I don’t know how many of them even go to church every Sunday /much less deciding to devote their life to it /I don’t even know how many of the people that I know who consider themselves Catholic really even go that often 
[S1] Or even practice /it’s the same thing
[S3] Right, exactly
[S4] Maybe they feel just like some of the rituals during mass are kinds empty.
[S2] Well, yeah /if you’re doing the same thing every week it loses that special /that specialness /I mean it’s just kinda doing the motions /going
[S4] And one thing I don’t get is /uh / there /uh / belief of transubstantiation /I don’t know if you guys know about that? /how the body and blood becomes /ya know the bread and wine becomes the body and blood of Christ /I mean I see it as a symbol /I don’t really 
[S2] Yeah /that’s like a huge debate in theology.
[S1] Yeah
[S2] I think what they officially say is that there’s kind of two forms of reality that like the Eucharist has /like it’ll have the physical form and then like I guess like the spiritual form if you wanna call it /and they say like the physical form /like over transubstantiation /the physical form stays the same like it stays bread and wine /but the spiritual form will change from bread and wine to the body of Christ /but I mean like that argument itself is kinda /cause you can’t really prove that
[S4] Yeah
[S3] And people who believe it go their whole lives and never really know 
[S1] It’s basically faith.
[S3] In basically every religion you have to have a strong belief to be devout.
[S1] Another thing too is how many people now even hold that kinda strong belief that you really can be /like not that it’s wrong to question things /but that you really can just based on faith /just believe /I feel like there’s a lot of things that make it so hard to believe now
[S4] What I was thinking /um /going back to the original questions of priests marrying /I mean if you took a survey of like all the Catholic priests /how many would actually want to get married and ya know kinda give up that sacrifice that they made?
[S2] That’s a good question.
[S1] Part of me agrees with what /um /ya know /that we should let them get married but then ya know /or let married men become priests /but I think that /ya know and choosing my words /I think that’s kind of lowering the standards because /ya know /if you can get paid to do an extra job or ya know oh I’m kind of an OK Catholic /like I go to church every week and ya know I can do this /and I think a lot of like married men would start to do it for the wrong reasons /where ya know with celibacy and knowing that you have to live /ya know /at the church or whatever campus or wherever you work at /it takes a lot more devotion than going home at night /and plus the /to be a priest /ya know /I think about pastors at my school /I went to a Catholic high school and grade school /their job was 24 hours a day /I mean /they /I don’t know how you could upkeep a life /ya know /a good home life and that job /I mean that’s almost
[S3] You’d have to slack in one of them.
[S1] Right, and you /I mean you can’t as a priest /ya know with society and how hard religion is and I think that most priests going into it know it pretty much becomes their life
[S3] And you have to wonder how many /much that would change because how many people in your high school /like you said there was not one /how many people do you think their one reason of not becoming a priest was because they couldn’t get married? /like you have to have /if you really wanted to become a priest /not being able to get married wouldn’t be standing in your way /like I don’t know if that would change much from it
[S4] There’d be a whole lot more reasons other than
[S3] Exactly. If you’re not gonna become a priests it’s not because you want a wife also or a husband /ya know /I mean if we were working with the women too
[S1] Right
[S4] They do allow deacons to get married though. Which is kind of /I don’t know 
[S1] And you look at that as are there even enough deacons? I mean not really and they know they can get married and do that.
[S4] Even like Protestant religions /they allow ministers to marry
[S1] Right
[S4] It seems to work for them.
[S1] Yeah, true.
[S2] Also /um /you know they say if they ever allow priests to marry it might lessen the instances of like pedophilia happening /I don’t know if I agree with that /cause um for one /um /I feel that that was kind of like expounded by the media and like they made it sound a lot more widespread than it actually was /but also um I think /I mean unfortunately pedophilia can happen like anywhere /in any profession /it doesn’t have to be priests like /I don’t /I don’t know if it would /I don’t know if that would be a legitimate reason to go change
[S3] And then again I don’t feel like if the reason these men were doing that was solely because they couldn’t get married. And there’s a lot of cases where /I mean think of all the pedophiliacs who aren’t priests /ya know like all those kinds of things /you have to wonder would that have even been /like so OK /so let’s say they were able to be married /doesn’t mean that’s not gonna happen
[S2] Exactly
[S3] Doesn’t mean that wouldn’t have happened.
[S2] But, you’ve got to wonder /of all the cases that have come out into the open /there’s still a bunch that haven’t been put out /that you don’t know of /I just don’t understand the connection /like why priests would do that
[S4] I mean it seems like there’s a higher incidence than in other men
[S1] Well, I think it might be related with /um /you know um being /they say /um /from being /what I’ve heard /it’s mostly that priests molesting young boys, correct? /um / I think that maybe ya know a lot of these men were thinking about what they were gonna do with their lives /they may have been homosexual and at the time /you know now homosexuality’s a much more open thing but that’s relatively recent /back then it was /you didn’t tell your family /you didn’t you know go to /you know /gay pride parades and such /it was much more of a closed life and that might have been the only option for them to have a respected life
[S3] Instead of like coming out and saying something about it /you go and hide kind of
[S1] Or living alone for the rest of your life because you couldn’t /you know /wasn’t as accepted /so I think maybe a lot of it was driven into that
[S2] So you think it’ll just pass like with the generation?
[S1] No, I don’t think pedophilia will ever pass /but, um
[S2] Well, lessen at least?
[S1] Hopefully, I mean maybe.
[S3] Cause I do agree /I mean I feel in many of the /I mean I didn’t /I don’t know about all of them /but I think a lot of them felt as though church was a place to hide because you could be a priest and /you’re actually more respected than almost any other profession you could have been in /and then he doesn’t have to say I’m not getting married because I like men /he can just say I’m not getting married because I’m a priest
[S1] Right
[S3] It’s a much more respected way in that time to be able to say that
[S1] Right, and there’s many instances of /you know /years back men getting married and not even being attracted /you know /having kids and the whole nine yards to hide the fact that they were homosexual when in fact they weren’t attracted /they admitted later when it became OK to become openly gay /they weren’t attracted to their wives and they didn’t want to have kids with their wives /it was just the lifestyle that was chosen for them as a man /so
[S3] I feel like that was definitely a factor in it. If not, then it would have changed a lot /that was definitely part of it
[S1] Which, on that topic /I think that /um /the stance on homosexuality in the church is /um /should be adjusted /um because it’s being proven that /um /as far as I know that /um /it is some kind of chemical or genetic or ya know some sort of /I don’t know what word I want to use /but um I think the church should take that into consideration
[S4] I feel like they don’t want to change their view because that would be a sign of weakness on their part
[S1] Yeah
[S4] Even though they kinda know that they’re wrong.
[S3] If it does come out that it is a genetic difference /it’s almost being like if you have blonde hair you’re not allowed to be part of the church /that it comes on that level /or if like you suffer from a disability or a birth defect or something like that or something genetic like down’s syndrome /it’s like saying you can’t be part of the church because of that /so I feel like if it does /which I’ve seen that too that they’re getting closer and closer to saying what is the source of it /they almost would have to because then it becomes a discrimination issue
[S1] Well they have gotten to the point where they’re /you know /they say we recognize that it’s a situation that we need to deal with and that people who are homosexual will be accepted in the church, however the lifestyle of a homosexual will not /so I don’t know /they have said that at least
[S2] It’s kind of funny /cause I mean /wasn’t it within the past like half century that the church has admitted that the earth was round or something like that
[S4] Yeah, I think so.
[S1] You’re right.
[S4] I think it was like 97 that they /uh /like released Galileo’s books from the list of banned books.
[S3] I feel like they’re very stubborn in a lot of ways /like that /so even if like today they said /um being homosexual is a genetic difference from /they probably I mean who knows when they would actually say alright /I guess we’ll recognize that
[S2] Well
[S1] Right /but I mean should /sorry go ahead
[S2] Um /I mean I think they can’t be quick to change with everything because then it’d just trivialize the entire message of the church /it would just kinda be like a fad that just changes with people’s views /doesn’t really mean anything
[S1] I agree.
[S3] I do think they’re a little slow.
[Laughter]
[S1] Well that’s because /I mean we’re in such a fast paced culture now /I mean we /think of how much has changed in our lives in the past five years /how much ya know /I mean even just with religion /think of how more devout /my grandmother went everyday /I don’t even attend on weekends now /maybe holidays /you know /it’s just /it’s very different in general /when I hear of people that go every week /I’m almost like wow, people still do that? /so I think that we expect so much from the church /you know to change /but in some ways I’m impressed that their strong hold /you know some of the issues really get me mad that they haven’t changed or you know adapted to culture /but sometimes I’m impressed that they can be strong and that culture is so wavy sometimes /you know /and 
[S3] It’s almost like if we aren’t giving very much to them /how can we expect them to do much back for us when they’re like when was the last time you went to church?
[S1] Right
[S3] You’re trying to take a stand against it /I mean not to say there aren’t people that are upset with it that do go every week, but there isn’t much of a following /I bet /compared to even probably 20 years ago /but definitely back to when our grandparents /definitely not near as much of a following
[S1] And it’s not /it’s not as if this is the first time the church has dealt with such a situation of backlash /I mean think back to /you know /Luther and you know /when people just didn’t want /they said this is done /we don’t believe in the things you’re doing /we’re not going to pay you everything we want to make a um /what’s the word I’m looking for?
[S4] Indulgences?
[S1] Right, yeah /it just /you know /this is not the first time this has happened so /you just have to take that into consideration
[Do you guys want to talk a little bit more about the marriage subject, or allowing female priests? Well you were saying /um /that you think that priests should devote their whole lives to the church, but maybe what do you think about other religions where the pastors are allowed to get married? What do you think the difference is there?]
[S1]  I mean I really can’t speak for /I don’t know /I’ve never seen /my only knowledge of a pastor is watching 7th Heaven probably /[laughter] /so I really cant speak to that /um /I really don’t know how they do it /for me, watching my priest /you know /do what he does /I cant imagine him having a wife with /you know watching my own mother in her needs of my father /you know and you know with him going to our games growing up or you know whatever the issue /that I couldn’t imagine one man being able to /you know /people do that in other religions /I have no idea how they do it /but I really don’t have any knowledge of it either so
[S3] I think it also goes back to a tradition really /because in these traditions they have been allowed to marry for at least as long as I’ve been alive /ya know? /so they /and they have maybe I think /as much as I’m sure they can find a balance /I think maybe priests /all of a sudden people would feel like they were slacking and they weren’t doing what they should be doing /whereas maybe /you know maybe we’re asking too much and maybe they can marry /but people would think immediately that they were slacking and weren’t being as good as they were before
[S2] I could imagine /like um in some religions /for marriage to be essential /cause like that feeling of love could tie you to even like deeper to whatever God you are thinking about
[S4] I think some of the Protestant religions allow it because they just haven’t been around as long as the Catholic Church /so they have /I don’t know /less tradition
[S3] Cause even like you said /the celibacy was tied back to like how Jesus was celibate /and like other religions kind of don’t have that ties back to the one /[laughter]
[Are there any other areas of the church that you can think maybe need to be a little bit more modernized? Any other beliefs?]
[S1] Um /maybe birth control
[S4] That’s a good topic, yeah.
[S1] As a general topic /you know not just birth control, but natural family planning or wherever you want to go with that /um /I’m in support of the use of birth control /you know obviously
[S3] And even with natural family planning /I mean you can wed /and I mean you’re married for even 20 years /and I mean you can try and be the best you can but what happens when oh you have four kids and you are able to support all four kids and then life throws you another one /is it better to now have five kids that you might not be able to give as best a life that you could and can’t provide for them as well or should you have stopped at four? Just planning always doesn’t work out the way you would like it to /it’s not very consistent
[S1] Right /I mean there’s a big difference between /you know /I want two kids because that’s how I thought my life would turn out and really being able to afford up to you know however many or for a woman’s health /you know? /if you physically can’t /because I /my cousin couldn’t have anymore kids /she got /she had lupis and she couldn’t physically have any more children /then you’re in a position /she was only 26 years old /you know /are you supposed to never have sex again with your husband? /It just doesn’t seem
[S3] Especially at the age of /you’re 26 /it’s not like she was /ya know? /I mean not that you should even be told that you can’t /but especially at the age of 26
[S1] Right, she wasn’t close to /you know /menopause or anything to a point where she couldn’t get pregnant /she was still of child-bearing age and
[S3] But just couldn’t have children.
[S1] Right
[S2] Well, I think with that /like again to like Catholics /like the act of making love or whatever is supposed to be like the ultimate gift from God /so I mean they just don’t want us to trivialize it and just treat it like /you know an everyday thing /it’s supposed to be like a gift that you like take with responsibility
[S3] Which I can understand that view on maybe like their other views on sex when you’re younger /things like that /like before marriage /those kind of things /but again like in the case of your cousin /when it becomes something like that where you are married and it was something where you’re devoted to one person and then you still /like you said /like what are they supposed to /tell her never again /like she’s only 26
[S1] And, you know natural family planning only goes so far /I mean that’s /you’re taking a much larger risk using that as a form of birth control then a ya know condom or whatever /the pill /whatever form
[S3] Yeah, any form
[S1] It’s much more risky to use that.
[Do you have any opinion on this subject?]
[S4] Um /I don’t know /I think they should change their opinion on sex in general /they see it as just a way to procreate /kinda like see it as I don’t know dirty to do it for other reasons /so I think they should change their opinions on that
[S2] Yeah /that’s kind of trivializing it in itself /I mean /you know /kind of dulling it down
[S4] Right
[S3] And even in the past, I mean like [inaudible] /but think about how much more open our society has become to things such as sex and even talking openly about birth control and those kinds of things /I mean you can’t turn the T.V. on without a commercial for something /and even the way that it is so publicly and so well known /and I mean so out /so open /I mean the church is /I still think again I mean a little bit behind in that /I mean when we think about a couple of things /but you’re right not to say they can change everything /or they’d be changing everyday and we wouldn’t even pay attention to them anymore /but this is something that has been /it’s enough of an issue that something should be done
[S4] And plus birth control’s been a /such a great thing for humanity in general cause the world’s over-populated as it is /it’s true
[S1] And there’s definitely people having children that don’t /can’t afford it and shouldn’t
[S3] Yeah and then can’t provide for them and then that goes back to the same thing of so 
[S1] Or abortions /it leads to abortions
[S3] Right /it’s the kind of thing where you’re just gonna end up having /you’re gonna have a lot of people with kids that don’t necessarily want them and don’t necessarily /I mean even just not being /even if you wanted a child and can’t provide for them /it’s almost like well this could have been prevented wouldn’t that have been a better thing? /wouldn’t that have been a better idea?
[S1] Yeah
[S3] To prevent something like that
[S1] Right, and life doesn’t always work out as well as /you know they go into a /you know they get adopted immediately and have this wonderful family /it’s just /you know even thought there’s great people that want children and there’s these kids that need parents /it doesn’t always connect this easily 
[S3] There’s kids everywhere that don’t have a family or have a home or anything like that.
[S1] Right /in this country and other countries
[S3] Of course.
[Any other thoughts about the Catholic Church that you would change or things you want to keep the same? OK /alright, we’ll stop there]
