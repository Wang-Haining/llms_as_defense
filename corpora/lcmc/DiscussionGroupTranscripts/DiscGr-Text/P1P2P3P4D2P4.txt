GROUP 1234
PRIVACY RIGHTS
[Recently school officials prevented a school shooting because one of the shooters posted a Myspace bulletin. Do you think that this was an invasion of privacy? And, who would like to start us off?]
[S2] Well I think /um /Myspace is kind of like /um /known to be like public /cause it’s kinda of like a public forum /I mean I don’t know like the specifics of the Myspace posts, but I’m assuming that you could just go to any Myspace and type in slash whatever and just get information without having any prior qualification or having to belong to any kind of group or anything like that /so I think it’s legitimate to use that kind of information /or for the [inaudible] /like information off of that kinda page
[S4] And I think it’s like a /it’s got to be a situational kind of thing because if it’s to prevent a school shooting then obviously you got to act on that information whether or not it’s an invasion of privacy.
[S1] You have to know that anything you’re posting on the internet can and will be found by someone /there’s very few things /even if you delete it off of a website like Myspace or Facebook, it’s still not on the internet somewhere /it never disappears /it’s always out there
[S2] I think they still have to withhold or uphold /um / like privacy concerns though /like if it’s a private group /even though that information should stay on, you shouldn’t have to worry that it can be accessed by anyone
[S1] Right, but with a post or something like that 
[S2] On Myspace
[S1] Yeah, like on Myspace or something like that /I know the bulletins when you make them it goes to /anyone who’s your friend can see it, and a lot of people don’t have restrictions on who can see it /so if you’re putting it out there like you kinda have to know that anyone could see it
[S3] Right /um / at my school there was a situation that even went /in high school /um / as far as somebody said something /I don’t know the details /it was probably pretty bad, but something mean about another girl on their Myspace /and they ended up getting suspended for it /um /it wasn’t a death threat or anything of that nature /um / I guess it was some sort of slander or something of that nature, but /um / so I don’t know if that is necessarily appropriate /you know /preventing a school shooting is one thing, but to say something mean about somebody in writing then can you get in trouble every time you do that? /I don’t know /doesn’t seem right to me
[S2] Well, again, that’s like /that’s public information /I mean that could be technically /um /classified as like slander /couldn’t it?
[S3] Yeah, that’s what /that’s what it was /I don’t know /I just don’t know if I agree with /you know /I don’t personally have one and that’s why /you know /somebody has complete access to everything you say, and I don’t /you know /you don’t want that, but um /I don’t know if they should have the right to just look on every person’s and everything you say /if you use a swear word on Myspace /are you gonna start getting in trouble at school? /or if you do /you know
[S1] I think it’s the kind of thing for appropriate reason /I don’t know if necessarily /like I hope they don’t have enough time to go on every student’s webpage and try to see what /exactly what they’re saying about everyone /you know /that would be a ridiculous job /but, if it’s for something where /someone brings it to their attention that there was a threat or there was /something like that then /then like you say it was public information and anyone could see it, so 
[S3] I believe they /sorry I didn’t mean to cut you off
[S1] No, it’s ok.
[S3] I believe they changed the privacy setting so that you could make it so that only the people you’re friends with can see, however a lot of people still have /um /you know /you can just literally type Myspace dot com slash that person’s name if you know it and get /you know everything /minus maybe their pictures or something like that /but I think /um /even if you have a Myspace you can see anybody’s right?
[S1] Yes
[S3] So, you don’t even have to be friends with them.
[S1] There’s like a certain way /I think it works /the certain way is that you can have a limited profile where like you can only see the person’s name and where they’re from and their main picture, but you can limit it to /but then most people don’t limit it /anyone in the entire world can see it
[S3] That’s just ridiculous in its own way.
[S1] Yeah
[S2] I think you gotta realize thought that the internet’s not the most secure place to put information. 
[S3] Absolutely
[S1] Absolutely not /so it goes kinda along the same way as if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say it /like don’t type it either /you know /like all those sort of things /anything /you have to expect that like everyone and like their mother can see your /anything you write ever on the internet /so you have to know that before you post anything /you have to almost wonder if the guy with the school shooting was like looking to get caught /putting a bulletin up on Myspace being like I’m gonna shoot the school up /you kinda have to wonder if he was looking to get caught
[S2] Well
[S3] Well, a lot of /sorry, go ahead
[S2] No, that’s ok. So, do you guys think that they should be able to use information that’s like part of a private group type thing? Or
[S4] I don’t think they should actively seek it out /like have a commission that looks at students’ profiles, but if they’ve come across information that could 
[S1] Like if it’s brought to their attention /like someone was probably like, hey I read something about our school getting /um /you know somebody shooting up our school /then sure, check it out /but I don’t know if you necessarily need to spend all your free time looking at your students and trying to figure out what they’re doing wrong
[S3] From what I understand /um /at Loyola they have /um /people in the student association or something like that, have access to Facebook /unless you have a certain like /nobody can see my profile unless they’re friends with me /um / you know /so that you couldn’t see a picture or you couldn’t see anything but their name and their year /um/ but there’s people who have gotten in trouble at Loyola /can’t quote me on that, but for having things in their Facebook profile /so
[S2] I think they established that they’re allowed to use that, right? Pictures and 
[S1] But, I /I agree /I think they did do that because I mean any of it /I guess /is like evidence, but I think it’s also that when you’re getting in trouble for something /they can use that as evidence /I don’t know if necessarily they were just like, oh today I’m gonna look up this person and then call you and be like, haha I hope you had a good weekend /I’m gonna get you in trouble now /so I think it’s something that they use it as kind of a tool for proof and evidence /but I don’t know if they’re necessarily searching for it /cause I don’t know if you should necessarily be looking /it’s like looking for trouble /I mean like I don’t know [inaudible] /you just need to know what you’re putting out there /you need to know if you post a picture of something that’s not exactly right /then you should know that people can see it
[S4] Although, if you’re talking about pictures where like you’re holding a beer can, that still doesn’t prove that you were drinking. There’s no way to prove from a picture that you were doing anything, at least drinking.
[S2] Well, possession of alcohol I guess.
[S4] That’s true.
[S2] I mean you can never really tell anything from a picture just because it’s like static /like even if you’re going like that you can just say you were /spit it our after or it’s water /for the recorder, I was holding a beer can 
[Laughter]
[S3] However, I bet you people really don’t use that one anymore.
[Laughter]
[S1] Probably not, how many times ya gonna believe that one? Um, they’ve also said that some places /um / like check up on you on Facebook and like Myspace if you have a job.
[S3] Yup
[S1] If they’re hiring you for a job
[S3] Right
[S1] And, they’ll like kinda check out /what do we think about that?
[S2] Say that again.
[S1] Um, some places when you go to apply for a job /they’ll look you up on Facebook or Myspace and kinda look at all that kinda stuff /how do you feel about that?
[S2] Huh, that’s interesting. Well, like Facebook, how would they access that?
[S1] I’m not sure how it works, I just heard they /that some companies /I mean maybe someone has a Facebook account or has a Myspace account and will kinda type your name in and see if 
[S3] Depends on your network and who 
[S1] Right, depends on your network and again it depends on if you’re being safe about it and only having your friends view it, or if everyone can view it.
[S3] Well, I think that in /in the workplace, I know that you do represent you know your work community, but I do feel that when you are in /as long as you’re not coming to work /you know drunk or publicly slandering the company or you know /acting out of line at work /if you perform our job accordingly and /um /you’re above the age of 21 /it’s like what more do you want from me?
[S1] I agree, like from nine to five I’ll do what you ask me to do.
[S3] Like, I don’t think you should be /you can’t be doing anything like be a rapist or anything
[S1] Right
[S3] You know that’s /that’s gonna be a problem /[laughter]
[S1] But, I don’t know if that’s /if they’re necessarily checking for a rapist
[S3] I mean, but drinking wise
[S2] Look at this, rapist /occupation
[Laughter]
[S3] Um, but otherwise I don’t think that it’s appropriate for them to use it against an employee.
[S1] Yeah, like what are they gonna say? You drink too much? It’s like, thanks mom. You know /like thanks for checking up on me
[S3] Because if they hire you 
[S2] What about if you work at a /uh / brewry /brew-er-ry /that could be a conflict of interest with your job
[S1] I think that’s an extreme case though.
[S3] Wait, what?
[S2] What if you’re an alcoholic working at a brewery, and they /you know /looking into your personal life or whatever /I mean that could effect your /it’s just an example /I don’t know 
[S3] I mean, yeah, but how /what is /you’re not stealing from the company /you know /are you? /is that what you’re /I don’t know what you mean
[Laughter]
[S2] I guess it would have to be some kind of action that warrants certain
[S1] Pictures of him in like the back store room searching through all their stuff.
[S3] Oh, ok /I don’t know /I don’t think that 
[S1] I feel like for the /I feel like you have your job from nine to five and then afterwards /after five it’s kind of your time and like you said /as long as you’re of age /you do what you gotta do /just be ready to go to work at nine again
[S3] Right
[S1] And not be drinking during the day or /you know /anything like that /and then I don’t really know if they /it was surprising to me though that a lot of companies would care cause I guess I agree with you that like you represent the company, but at the same time /you can’t tell me like the big bosses in the company don’t have a good time on the weekends /[laughter] /you know /so /you don’t almost /I don’t know 
[S2] What do you guys think about /uh /the [inaudible] 
[S3] Well /um 
[S2] Well first of all, do you support it or?
[S3] I’m /I’m not sure to be honest with you /I think that it’s necessary to do some screening, but what is listening or taping my phone conversations helping /you know /I meant can’t they establish a place for you know to see if mainstream terrorists are using a phone /or /you know /using the internet /like what does reading my emails from my Mom or talking to my friend on the phone helping them? It just kind of skeeves you out to know somebody could be listening or taping.
[S2] Well, I don’t think it would be possible to /for them to like a mainstream /you know /terrorists /like where they go hang out
[S1] [Laughter] /where they go make their phone calls
[S3] I just don’t understand how it works.
[S4] I think that it’d be necessary to have a system where they listen for code words like bomb or assassinate /those kinds of things /I think it’s something like in the D.C. area /they monitor more heavily /but like that /that doesn’t mean they’re listening /they’re listening for like the words /and then they would listen in on those conversations
[S1] The way I see it /I mean if /it’s one of those kind of things where /like you said /why do you have to listen to my conversations with my Mom /but, if I’m talking to my Mom and we’re talking about what happened to me that day /like first of all they’re not listening, but if I happen to say the word bomb to my Mom and they do start listening /if /they’re not gonna necessarily find anything by me and I’m not gonna really be saying anything about being a terrorist because I’m not /but, if this program can even catch one terrorist /and so you had to listen to me tell my Mom about a test I had /then like isn’t that worth it? /you know, if we can catch even one person more than we would have even without listening to phone calls at what /the risk of them having hear me talk about my weekend /then I don’t care
[S4] Right, it’s for our own safety/ so
[S1] Right, and if they find that it works and they can really catch them or stop something from happening from this then go for it.
[S2] I would support it as long as I can be guaranteed that that information won’t be used for anything else besides catching terrorists. I mean otherwise, it’s just like a total invasion of privacy.
[S3] Right, which is what I /I mean when I hear /when I think about it /I just /it’s so like big brother /just like somebody watching what you do /reading your emails, listening to you on the phone even if it is
[S2] As long as it does have that one purpose, I mean nothing bad can ever come
[S1] But, then again I feel like half the conversations that I have /I don’t even want to listen to them /much less someone else listening to them /and I mean most of the things /and that’s why /cause I do understand it’s like the whole feeling of like is someone seeing me right now? Like is someone listening to me? Why do you have to /you know why do you have to always feel like you’re being watched?  But, at the same time, I’m not gonna do anything wrong, so go ahead /listen to me talk for hours on the phone about anything /you know /as long as I'm not gonna /and I agree with you, as long as it’s not gonna be used like somehow against me /anything that I say /as long as it has that one purpose then go for it /catch that one person
[S3] It’s just that in the United States, I feel that we /we have our rights, and one of them is privacy, and I /I think as my understanding of privacy /we’re supposed to have complete right to talk as we please /you know /why should the up and coming technology mean that they get to listen to our business /even if /even if they’re not literally /you know /listening to what we’re saying /laughing about you know /if I’m talking to someone and wanted to say something embarrassing /I realize it’s not to that extent, but if our right is to have privacy, why should that be expended at this? And, I feel like there wasn’t enough explanation along with the terrorist /along with the [inaudible] /you know /it was just here it is
[S2] Also, I think that when somebody established those rights /like they never imagined we could be in this kind of war /where it could be /you know /any attack at any time /and it’s just so like internal /all these insurgents all over the place
[S1] And, I mean they definitely weren’t like ever thinking that there’d be a way to tap phone conversations and /I mean first of all
[Laughter]
[S1] And they were never thinking that there could be a way people would be able to have their private conversations / uh / I don’t know /cause I agree with you on how like why are we even violating that right basically /but, at the same time
[S3] I’m all for protection.
[S1] Right, exactly /I’m all for if you can stop something from happening or catch one person /then you know it’s worth having you to /worth me feeling /cause honestly I don’t sit around and like /wow, wish I had more privacy on the phone /it’s like one of those things that doesn’t really effect me /so whether it’s happening or not /try to catch someone /like stop something from happening /then I’ll be ok with it
[S4] I think people are against it because it seems like racial profiling because a lot of the calls they pick up are from Middle Eastern /you know /terrorist [inaudible] /so I mean it seems kind of racial, but that’s just the way /it’s just the way it is
[S1] I mean yeah, but /I mean when you /and it might be racial profiling /like they could see it as that, but again like they’re not gonna track all the calls from here to Wisconsin because /I mean what are the chances?
[S2] Why is it racial profiling? Because most of the calls they pick up are Middle Easter in origin or?
[S4] Right, the ones that are threats.
[S2] Ok
[S1] And, so obviously /like the ones that they’re gonna be listening more for are those kinda calls to and from the Middle East or those calls /so it’s kinda like well I’m just trying to call back home.
[S2] Oh, I got ya.
[S1] You know, like I’m trying to call my family or trying to call somebody I know there and then you’re being listened to just based on that one reason. But again, I mean kind of how are you gonna /how else would they do it? Like you know /if that’s where they’re finding that these terrorists are coming from /then again like it is reality /you’re not gonna track /they would be wasting time tracking from here to Alaska /it wouldn’t make any sense /they need to kind of /you know
[S2] Hmm. Well, I guess it kinda depends on if /I mean /I don’t know /it just makes more sense /we’re in a war with the Middle East right now /so if you’re gonna /if there’s calls going there
[S1] That’s gonna be where the terrorists are gonna be.
[S2] Yeah
[S1] If there are
[S2] If we intercept a call of like some terrorist cell in like some other country /it would just be more scary /[laughter] /like what a /what’ a /like what’s going on there now?
[S1] I mean you can never get away from some people /are gonna think /some people are gonna think it’s racial profiling no matter where you do it
[S3] As long as we’re not going as far as like /you know /World War two when they were putting /you know after the attack on Pearl Harbor they were putting /um /people /Japanese in internment jails /I mean
[S1] Oh yeah, things could get out of control /that would be racial profiling
[S2] Yeah, that’s not good rapport right there.
[So where do you think that you draw the line on /as to how much they can invade your privacy /for your safety]
[S3] I agree with him when he said if you use it for the purpose solely of /you know /you listen in /you don’t hear anything /you know nobody’s sitting around and laughing at the conversation you had with your friend /or you know /if you say something /if they know you’re under 18 or under 21 and you’re talking about drinking /they come and find you /I mean I think that’s a /you know /I just /if they’re using it for the purpose of terrorist attacks that are going to leave thousands of people /you know dead due to a /ok / you know
[S1] Yes, then please do.
[S3] Even a small terrorist attack /um /however, if you’re using it for other purposes /then we have rights /issues
[S4] I think that there’s not enough man power just strictly bases on that to
[S1] Right, I mean they have a big enough issue at hand trying to find terrorists /they’re not really gonna be /so again if they’re not really worrying about anything else and they’re focusing on the issue at hand /then that’s fine
[S3] All for it
[S1] Yeah
[S2] But, also /um / I mean they have to draw the line between like what /like where it’s /where it goes from an invasion of privacy to being necessary for like security reasons /I mean like you know obviously this is one extreme we’re talking about /like preventing a terrorist attack by you know temporary invasion of privacy /but, I mean like if the crime is a lot more less /I’m not talking about the [inaudible] I’m talking more in like general /like where do you draw that line?
[S4] Like a drug related thing
[S2] Could be that, yeah /true /or even like the school stuff /well school shooting is pretty big /[laughter] 
[S3] Yeah. I don’t know. I don’t /I mean I don’t know if you can use it to prevent everything. I don’t know if that’s /I don’t know /I guess you have to realize that it’s going on and you can’t talk about it on the phone /I mean when you watch like shows about /you know people that are /um / in the mob or whatever /they never talk about things on the phone /they always use code words and stuff 
[S1] Yeah, I was gonna say, they use nice little code words until they can meet in person.
[S3] So, maybe if you’re involved with something that could be a serious issue /you can’t talk about it on the phone /you know / or you can’t email your friend about it and tell him about your /you know coke deal the night before /[laughter]
[S1] Right, your big plans to like
[S3] I don’t know. Assuming that we have to
[S1] But, then again whether it’s one of those things where it’s an invasion of privacy or not /it is happening, and you have to know /the same thing with even this Myspace and Facebook thing /you need to know that basically anything that you say on the phone /anything you say on the internet /through email /whatever /assume it could eventually be found by someone
[S4] Or even like a journal 
[S1] Right, yeah, you need to assume anything besides spoken word
[S4[ Unless you keep it
[S1] You know /will be found /but, in that case /that’s why you don’t /not to say that it necessarily will be /you know I’m not saying necessarily that anything you say will be found or could be found, but it’s one of those things where the same /the same kind of thing you were talking about /like a coke deal the next day /you have to assume if you’re putting it out there /it can be found
[S3] But, then like if /my concern /like this is my problem with the whole thing /is it gonna end there? /or are they going to be going to the point where they /they have /they’re listening in buildings /you know /in certain buildings where you go /to what you say /like if they’re suspicious they could put taps in your /in your home /you know /it’s just like /it’s just such a shaky line for me /I just /not that I’m involved with anything drastic, obviously /but, it’s just thinking about it /it’s /what privacy right do we have? /like this is /this is somewhat impeding on privacy and while I’m for catching terrorists /or you know /extreme children that are bringing guns to school and in justice /it’s like where’s my justice for
[S1] I think that that’s it too because when we were trying to define a line for it /I think the line’s different for many people
[S3] Right
[S1] And, so I mean that’s the kind of thing too is /where is the line? /and, really where is it? /because we don’t really know where the line is /we don't know how to define it
[S4] Doesn’t /Doesn’t the FBI uh need like a warrant to use a domestic wire tap?
[S2] Yeah
[S1] Yes 
[S4] So, I mean the judges are aware of /you know invasion of privacy /they weight that out against /you know /potential risk I guess
[S2] Yeah, but I mean it’s also an issue on like /like with schools and stuff /like outside of the government /I mean inside of the government as long as they have that warrant and everything /then I guess that’s Ok because like you said a judge can review it and see the situation
[So back to the schools, where do you think they should draw the line?]
[S1] I think you don’t go looking for it /if it’s brought to your attention and something like that /like a Myspace bulletin could prevent something /and it’s brought to their attention /that’s Ok, but I don’t /I wouldn’t think it was very fair if thee was a whole group of people devoted to finding if students were wrong and catching them and punishing them /so
[S3] And, I think that as um /a minor /you /I don’t know if I’m wrong in saying this, but you don’t have as many rights to begins with /I mean it’s different /there are different situations when you’re minor.
[S1] For lots of things, there are/
[S3] Yeah, I mean /I feel like you /I mean I feel like it’s more realistic that you can’t put things like tat online that when you’re /you of an adult and But, when you’re twenty one and someone
 finds a book of you tweaking
[S1] Alright, how was your weekend? But you know when you’re 18, 19, 20 , you know it’s a much different issue cause it’s /you’re actually breaking the law
[S3] Right, and there’s a lot of /you know /standards to be upheld /even not as like a shooting, that’s to be upheld /that you can’t /you know slander someone /or you can’t do those sorts of things when you’re a minor and you’re /you know /singed into a school where you’re supposed to /they tell you from the beginning, you have an honor code to uphold the /even here /you’re not to drink /you’re not to you know act appropriately in public places /you know you are /we are representing Loyola and as a student /not a /some employees/employers even have that /but um you know as a minor /or you know we’re not minors but we’re not of age and we’re still students /you have to uphold certain things that you wont as an adult. I don’t know if that makes sense?
[S1] No, it does.
[S4] I think /I think you gotta draw the line where like if it’s for protection of your students /then you should act on it, but you shouldn’t go actively seeking out to prosecute people
[S2] Yeah, I would agree with that.
[S1] Cause we’re all for protection and it wasn’t in this case, but in the Virginia Tech shootings, like he didn’t even post anything like that /but imagine if something had been there and it was ignored /you know there had a been a /you know this didn’t really happen so it was a very hypothetical situation /but, if there had a post or something like that, and it was not brought to the attention /and if something could have been stopped /you know something
[S3] There was, I read an article /he has written countless plays I believe /I even read one of them /they were online /but, countless plays and papers, and different sorts of things /um /that some of the students were disturbed by /so he had said something 
I know the writing reach tried to get him to go like in to a mental hospital 
[S1] [Inaudible]
[S3] right so somebody knew, so should they have acted on that? I mean I don’t know.
[S1] I mean and that’s the big argument too /is it because um that writing teacher there /um /I don’t even know if we’re talking about [inaudible] anymore /but the private teacher there brought it to the attention of the school, and it said like listen I’m worried about him
[S2] This actually directly relates to the privacy code cause /cause she brought it to the /the like board of whatever of advisors /so I guess the administration, whatever you want to call it /and they couldn’t do anything /I guess cause he could say whatever he wants, like that’s his rights /you know he /they’re not allowed to 
[S1] Tell him what he says is wrong.
[S2] Actually, I’m not sure if that’s a privacy concern really.
[S1] Yeah, but in that case
[S3] Teachers aren’t supposed to discuss /I mean if they have a [inaudible] they’re allowed to bring it up, but
[S2] It’s the same, it’s the same kind of deal /what do you exploit like a right in order to
[S1] Cause in that case you/ the teacher
[S2] Get like
[S1] From the teacher that line’s been crossed /and then you /for that board of /I don’t know /the dean /I don’t know what that was, but for that board, the line wasn’t crossed, and they didn’t feel like they had to do anything about it
[S3] Are those things that he wrote? Is that a form of /um / you know what’s to come in his head or is it like /I mean think of the people who write
[S1] I mean like , yeah, Stephen King writes horror films 
[S3] Things that are messed up /whoever wrote umm /Saw?
[S1] Yeah, the Saw, yeah / I mean he can be considered a very disgusting man /whoever wrote that
[S3] Right so /I think as a student though /you’re being upheld to certain things /and that’s /you know /might be an issue on their hands if someone’s writing like that in school
[S1] And it goes again /yeah like you said to the right of it /to the rights of a school /whereas no it might not be violating the United States of America's privacy laws, but then the school kinda has its own judgment over it /because you are a student of the school /and you know / it’s like another stipulation you have to
[You can keep on going with that if you want]
[S4] I’ve got another issue /um /with like psychologists /who are /I don’t know if this is true or not /like if their client tells them about a murder they commit /can’t they go to the police and notify them?
[S2] No, they have the client /the client-patient whatever they call it
[S4] Does that always apply?
[S1] I feel like in the instance of that /like if you know /right before I came here I killed someone 
[S2] How about priests? It’s the same thing? 
[S4] Yeah same thing
[S2] But, they would never 
[S3] Priests aren’t held by law to /um /to reveal /actually um /some /I feel like if psychiatrists or psychologists reveal that they might lose their license or something like that /if they /it’s still taken in the court of law as a /you know confession /but, I think you might lose your license for privacy /I think there’s actually a stipulation like you have to choose between don’t and job continues or /you know, hey, I’m gonna commit an attack on school /do you want those kids to die or do you want to keep the privacy /I don’t know /I’m pretty sure there’s some kind of stipulation/ I’m not positive

[S3] I watch /um /the Sopranos and one of the main relationships in the show is a /um /the therapist has /um Tony Soprano /whose a mob boss /um /and they can’t say /she won’t allow him to say certain things because that makes her a /um /you know /a um /accessory /so she’s not allowed to repeat /she has the right to repeat those things /I know that has been said /but um /I don’t know
[S1] I think going from personal judgment /I don’t know what the consequences are /like you said /like would they get their license revoked or would they be able to continue practicing, but I think they /I mean it is up to /normal things /there is patient /like therapist confidentiality
