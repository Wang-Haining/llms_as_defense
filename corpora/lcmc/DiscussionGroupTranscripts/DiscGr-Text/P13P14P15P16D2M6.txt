MARIJUANA
[Everyone’s ready? Ok. The city of Denver has decided to legalize small amounts of marijuana for person’s over 21. How do you feel about this?]

[Laughter]

[S16] I don’t know / when it comes to drugs / I feel like / like I’m not a drug addict [Laughter] but like / I feel like / they should / I don’t see the point in illegalizing them at all

[S13] In legalizing or illegalizing? 

[S16] In illegalizing / any drug / like / as long as people know the / harmful affects that it can have / just like / I see it the same way as cigarettes / like / cigarettes are legal / we know that they’re bad for us / probably worse than some drugs for us / but like / that’s allowed / and then / you just / illegalize drugs / like / if people want to use them / I think they should be able to / like  / I don’t know / it’s not really stopping anyone / like people can still get their hands on them / like whenever they want / pretty much / I don’t know / like I just / I don’t / yea / I don’t get it

[S13] you can’t really put like / cigarettes and like heroine in the same category though
[Laughter]
[S16]Yea / but they both / they’re both highly addictive though / but like / heroine / heroine I guess is seen as worse / and it might be worse / but

[S13] a little bit [Laughter]

[S16] yea / but still / if people want to do that / like / like / I guess we know that / I think that we know not to do heroine / so like / if they legalize it / we still wouldn’t do it / like I don’t think it would make a difference

[S14] Well / I mean / I agree / with you / to a certain extent / but / um / I mean / you can’t just look at the factor of like / oh / well / if people know what they’re getting into they can do it / because there’s a lot of other factors involved / such as / heroine and cocaine trafficking / like / if we legalize it / we’ll be supporting like / dictatorships in South America / and like drug lords / like we can’t hold a stance like that
[Laughter]

[S13] No. [Laughter]

[S14] So / while / I mean / I agree

[S16] Well based on just / yea / well if it’s just marijuana though / like / Canada’s even getting by / it’s legal in some parts of Canada 

[S14] it’s been / yea / I think it’s been a while now

[S16] Yea / and / yea / it really / I don’t know / like Canada seems to be getting along better than our country right now / I don’t know 

[S15] Well they don’t have the war / I don’t think that has to do with like / them getting along better / having to do with / them having legalized marijuana [laughter]

[S14] And I think / on the / ya know / other points besides just / the like / people know what they’re getting into / like / marijuana is not that bad of a drug / like / um / it’s probably better than you / better for you than / well / not / it’s not gonna be good / it’s not good for you / but / it’s not as bad as like even alcohol or cigarettes / so / I mean / I think / main reason why marijuana is illegal / and those drugs aren’t / is because the tobacco industry / and the alcohol industry are so huge in America / that / ya know / governments can’t put regulations on them / because they are supported by the businesses who own these things / so 

[S16] uh-huh / well if we did legalize it though / then like / we could just turn into like / more businesses and more jobs / like I would think / it would create more jobs / like people growing cocaine / like / just like tobacco / like it’s not a great / like it’s not the best situation but like / if that’s what people want then I think they should be able to do it

[S15] I don’t know / personally / I don’t agree with it / but / I would be more accepting of legalizing marijuana than I would be of just like / as you’re suggesting like / all drugs / like / I think that’s getting a little out of control

[S13] Yea / um / I would not go as far as to say to legalize all drugs / um / marijuana / I don’t really know what I think about it / I keep / I don’t know / I keep / teetering back and forth / I guess you’d say I’m on the fence / at this point right now / I would / say that / it’d probably be more profitable to our country / to actually legalize it / and create businesses / and / I guess / put a regulation on it / saying like / you can’t do it til like 18 / like cigarettes / put out like the warning signs / and what it’s bad for your health / cause it’s not good / and / I mean / at least it’s / in a way it’s almost slightly / better than cigarettes / cause it’s not addictive / kind of / um / but / I mean / I’m definitely not saying it’s a good drugs / but I almost think it would be / better if you legalized it / because then / instead of / throwing everyone in jail / we could manage it easier / kinda like how you manage cigarette manufacturers / and stuff like that

[S16] It would also free up a lot of jail cells [Laughter] Yea like / if people are / getting thrown into jail for like / selling marijuana / that’s just like eating up space for people / who commit like real crimes / like killing people / and like / 

[S13] And I mean / I’m not saying I’m gonna feel like this / next week / but this is how I feel like right now / so / I don’t know

[S14] um / well / just to say a couple things about the drug in general / um / and like why it’s not really a harmful drug / um / first of all / there’s the / ya know / it’s not addicting / like cigarettes and alcohol and can be / they decided to tag this term / psychologically addicting onto it / which is more of like a scare tactic / because that doesn’t mean anything / I mean / if you like something that you do / you’re going to do it again / like I mean / the first time I ate ice cream / I liked it 
[Laughter]
[S14] so / I ate it again

[S16] It’s not good for you.

[S13] I’m addicted to ice cream.

[S14] And I kept doing it after that / but like / what makes / the word addicting mean something is that it’s hard to get off of / it’s hard to / stop using / and that’s just not a problem with marijuana / I mean / if you want to stop / smoking marijuana / you just quit cold turkey / um / where it’s much more difficult to quit / if you’re a cigarette smoker or drink alcohol / um / well / I could go back to other points later if 

[Laughter]

[S16] Someone else can go.

[Inaudible] [Laughter]

[S16] I gotta think of something.

[Laughter]

[S13] That’s a pretty leaf

[Laughter]

[S13] They wear it a lot as jewelry in Spain.

[Laughter]

[S13] I know that much.

[S16] I don’t know / I mean / I’m pretty much for / I don’t see why it should be illegal / anywhere / and like

[What do you guys think about its effects in relation to / um / the effects of alcohol / comparing the two and the fact that alcohol is legal]

[S16] I think they’re pretty much the same thing / like

[Does everyone think that?]

[Laughter] 

[S16] I don’t know / I think so / I see them the same way / like / getting drunk or getting high / like / I don’t know / I think it’s the same thing / like one’s illegal / but / it really doesn’t do anything worse because / as long as you don’t do bad things while you’re like / on / when you’re like drunk or like / when you’re / high / like / I don’t see how it would be mad / if it was just for recreational use / I don’t know

[S14] um / well / I would disagree / um / but / probably / I actually think smoking marijuana is better for you / than drinking alcohol

[S16] Well yea / if anything

[S14] I mean / first of all / drinking alcohol / it is addicting / there’s / if you’re a heavy drinker there’ll be irreparable damage / on your

[S16] Liver

[S14] Yea / where as like / long term affects of smoking marijuana / um / right now / there are none / they haven’t been able to prove anything / they’ve been trying to prove that / this’ll cause lung cancer and / that / there would be other debilitating problems with it / haven’t been able to prove anything / and in fact / studies have shown / that’s not even true / and even if it was true / it would only show up in like heavy smokers / like / people who smoke everyday / and / um / where as / people who have alcohol problems / ya know / are much worse off / than / um / something else / is that / there’s like / um / alcohol / like screws you up much more than smoking pot does / um / I mean / you can O.D / I  mean / I don’t know if that’s the right word to use with alcohol

[S16] Yea / cause if you drink too much / you die / no one has ever overdosed on marijuana

[S14] Well / you can’t.

[S16] Yea.

[S14] It would take smoking pounds of marijuana to overdose.

[S16] Yea / I think you would just pass out / before it would happen

[S14] Yea / um / yea / I mean / the deaths caused by marijuana / not counting like / car crashes / or like you did something stupid cause you were high / like 

[S16] that’s the same with drunk / like driving drunk / like / if you don’t want to allow it / you can make a law against drunk driving / but like / getting drunk isn’t really / I don’t know / it’s not really legal / right / like being / at least like in public

[S13] Yea / in public

[S16] But like yea / drinking is legal / and / there’s a law against drunk drinking / because that could put other people’s lives in danger / so like / if you legalize marijuana / and just / make a law that would prevent it / from hurting other people / I think that would be the easiest solution

[S13] But like / even though there is a law / against like / drunk driving / it still happens / like a lot / and people’s lives are lost / if we like / if we legalize marijuana / and make it like / more easily accessible / aren’t we just gonna be like / increasing people driving while they’re high / as well as while they’re drunk / like / I mean / not to say people don’t do it anyway / but / I think it just / like / increases it 

[S16] yea / well / I don’t know / if / I don’t know if driving high is as bad as driving drunk / like / it’s / it’s a different type / it does a different thing to you / like / driving drunk / just like / I mean / yea / when you get drunk / it just like slows down your reflexes / and everything / and like / it has known effects that would prevent you from driving well / but / like / smoking / marijuana / like / you’re paying attention / I think you could handle it / like / better than if you were drunk

[S14] well / I mean / the major difference between alcohol and marijuana is that / alcohol is a barbiturate / it slows down your reflexes / while / um / although marijuana is considered a hallucinogenic / it also has / um / stimulant properties / and you’re gonna have an increased awareness of what’s around you / and like / um / while I don’t agree with driving high / like / it’s better than driving drunk / so 

[S15] It’s not better than driving / like

[S14] sober

[S15] Yea [laughter]

[S16] but like / I don’t know / people do it anyway / like / if / when they / when they / banned drinking / and  made prohibition laws / people still / smuggled in drinks / and drank / and I’m sure some of them / drove / but / like / it’s just the same now with marijuana / like / it’s / it’s something that / some people see as / bad / for like the wrong reasons / so like / everybody has to suffer for that / I don’t know / I think it should / definitely be legalized

[S14] well / um / to what you said about / you’re actually increasing / I don’t think that would happen at all / ya know / part of the reason / why marijuana is such a problem is because it’s illegal / because / it’s more / interesting and fun to do / than drinking / I think countries that have legalized it / it’s just like Holland and Netherlands / Switzerland / um / it’s actually decreased teen smoking / so / I don’t know [laughter]

[S13] Um / when you say / decrease teen smoking do you mean cigarettes or meaning

[S14] Meaning / smoking pot

[S15] I don’t know / the more I hear about it / um / I agree with it being legalized / because / it doesn’t like / crazy / it’s / I don’t know / I guess I just agree / cause like / it’s not as bad as / giving you lung cancer / it’s not gonna give you cirrhosis of the liver / it’s / I’m sure there’s some affect but it’s not really known yet / um / but / I feel like half the time / people / like smoking is the because of the thrill of / oh / I’m doing something illegal / and / this is fun / so / if you make it legal / then / that thrill is going to be taken away / and / it’ll just be left with / this is a social thing / and / that’s basically it

[S13] I don’t know / I mean / like I said / I’m on the fence with this issue right now / but / that’s how I feel / now 

[S14] I guess something else we’ve been talking about / it’s like / negative aspects / and why it isn’t as bad as other drugs / um / haven’t brought up / like / it’s positive aspects at all / which there / ya know / plenty / obviously using it for medicinal purposes / is / been / like proven to help / like / alleviate symptoms / of / um / I’m not even sure / I think it’s like cancer patients 

[S16] Glaucoma

[S14] Yea / and / I had another point but I forgot it

[S15] Also / if you do make it legal / you could regulate what you put it in / because / sometimes / I know with drugs / it’s not just the drug that’s put in / it’s like other random crap

[S16] they just like lace it with cocaine or whatever

[S15] right / so if you legalize it / you can probably regulate it / and it’ll just be like the pure 

[S16] Yea / cause like the government / like / if you / if you don’t want to legalize it / because it might have / like harmful effects / like / I don’t really think the government cares about that / because then they would illegalize smoking / cause they know it’s bad / like they can’t just / illegalize everything that they think is bad for you / I mean / there’s a lot of things that are bad for us that are legal

[S14] Um / I mean / definitely / if they do legalize it / they’ll be making profit off the

[S16] tax it

[S14] There’s a sin tax / like / how much does the government make off of alcohol / porn

[S16] Yea

[S14] cigarettes / so / yea

[Do you want to talk more about its effects compared to alcohol? How do you feel about it being legalized or]

[S15] Well / I know you don’t feel like it should be legalized / what are some more effects why / you feel / it should not be legalized 

[Laughter]

[S13] no no / I absolutely hate the smell of it

[You can talk about that stuff / it’s fine]

[S15] I don’t like the smell either.

[S13] like / I mean / I hate the smell of cigarettes / and like / I hate walking behind people / who are smoking / but like / I guess just like / I’m more used to that / but like / I don’t know / I absolutely hate the smell / so / like I would not want to be like standing outside where like / ya know / if people are smoking / then it’s like legal

[S15] It smells like burnt cauliflower.

[Laughter]

[S13] I know that’s like a stupid reason / but like / I would really hate that / like when I / I’ve been to the Netherlands / and like / I just like / I did not like that / like / I would just be sitting outside somewhere / and like / oh great / now I’m smelling it again / I don’t know / I don’t like it

[S14] I don’t know / I mean / if you said it was legal / and you had like bars where you could go to / to get high / which I think is a great idea / like / the smell can be like / put in different places / like they could have places where it’s legal to smoke / um / and / also think about if you’re like / if it’s legal and you can smoke it outside / like / that’s better than like the guys next door smoking it in the bathroom making your entire hallway smell like it 

[S13] That’s very true. [Laughter] Having it come up it the vents and like reek in your room / disgusting

[S14] Yea / our bathroom smells like it all the time / cause the vent comes

[S14] I guess / I don’t know / I was considering / debating this / like kinda in a mock way / just because / I feel like so strongly about it / I was thinking about like negative things that could happen / um / like for example / if it’s legalized / restaurants could use it in your food without telling you / so then you’ll eat more

[Laughter]

[S13] Oh my G-d.

[S15] Ew. That’s disgusting.  Ok / if they made it legalized / there would be a ton of rules that would be played into effect / cause I don’t want to be eating tobacco in my food / I don’t want to be eating pot in my food

[S14] well / I mean / it wouldn’t be tobacco

[S15] well I mean / I’m just saying / you smoke that / and you smoke / pot / I don’t want to have it in my food.  So you’d have to make a ton of regulations / I think that they should just start off like that / I know how / in Maryland recently they banned cigarette smoking in bars / so / maybe what they should do / be like what you said / have specific bars / and only at those bars / can you like smoke / and / um / then like / so many feet from like a building / and like in public places / are not / and not putting it in your food [Laughter]

[S13] Are you saying they could do that without it being like / advertised on the menu / or it would specifically say that it was gonna be there?

[S14] Well / I’m just [Laughter] this is just a silly thing / but / um 

[S13] Something to talk about 

[S14] I mean / you can put it in popcorn or brownies / without even knowing it / and / ya know / pretty soon / you eat like five plates / of the restaurants food / and you gotta pay like / fifty dollars / I don’t know

[S13] I would have to say that / if they’re gonna put it in food / they have to say it on the menu.

[S15] Yea.
[Laughter]
[S15] Like a little / at least a little asterisk / like look below / warning / this food may contain marijuana 
[Laughter]
[S14] Well / it’s not gonna happen [laughter]

[S15} Well no / it’s a good point / like [laughter] it’s good

[S14] No / it’s not

[S15] I don’t really have much to say about it / like I don’t feel that strongly about it / I just don’t like the smell so / I don’t want it to be / like / all over the place [laughter] that’s really my main reason 

[S13] There’s nothing really else?

[S15] I don’t know / this is not something that effects me / and I don’t really give it much thought / so / no / I don’t really have / a strong opinion on it / um / and / it’s hard to like think of things / especially when like / I hear / like everybody else says / it’s fine / so then I don’t / I’m not getting any aid in my reasons

[S13] This is why I’m telling you / to go for it

[S15] Yea / but I don’t have anything to say / I don’t know / but

[S13] Ok / so / I’ll go on your side for a little while / how about that / cause I’m on the fence / I guess

[S14] I’m gonna stick to my side 

[Laughter]

[S13] You’re fine. Um / ok / I know in the past / I was really against it / because / I was taught it was a drug / and / you can’t think as clearly on it / and / that / it was bad for you / and there was something else I was gonna say / but I cant quite remember it / I don’t know / I just know that I was really against it / when I was younger / and then / when I started to learn more about it on my own versus just my parents telling me about it / like in a school setting / um / we were still taught that it was not good for you / but then you started hearing about / how it was a little better for you than getting cancer [Laughter] or suffering / like from cigarette smoking / or for like / for the medicinal purposes / and / stop laughing / I’m trying to be on your side. And so / I don’t know / what I’m trying to say / that’s why / yea / I should just stop talking

[S15] I don’t know / I can’t really think of like a good reason / like / why not / but / I understand / yes / I agree it’s not as bad for you / and like / I can see what you’re saying how / if the government / like / is gonna allow alcohol and cigarettes / that are proven to be bad for you / that / ya know / they could just / let marijuana too / I don’t know / I don’t really care that much [Laughter] 

[S13] Maybe they can make it smell better. 

[Laughter]

[S15] I think it smells like what it smells like

[S14] Well / I mean / it’s possible to make it smell 

[S13] It’s like sickeningly sweet / I hate it. [Laughter]

[S15] I don’t think it smells sweet.

[S13] It is sweet.

[S15] I feel like it smells like / really / bitter / and like / burnt bad cauliflower [laughter]

[S14] Well I mean / you look at / um / gosh / what do they call it / um / you go to the bars that are like where you can smoke

[S13] Oh / hookah?

[S14] Yea / hookah bars.
[S13] Oh.

[S14] I mean / they make hookah smell good

[S13] Yea / that’s true / I’ve never been there / but that’s what I heard

[S14] And like / just cause pot dealers don’t care what it smells like

[S13]  Yea [Laughter]

[S14] I mean / something else I was thinking / ya know / if the government regulates this / I mean / ya know / you go out to buy some pot / now / and you go / you don’t know if it’s good stuff or / ya know / how weak it is or whatever / you just buy it / at whatever price / and go back to smoke it / if it’s weak stuff / ya know / I mean / you’re just screwed / if the government / or like / organizes it / you know / you got good shit / so 

[Laughter]

[Do you guys want to give another thought? Final thought?]

[S15] I don’t really care what they do / personally it doesn’t effect me.

[S13] I don’t know / if someone says something else / maybe I’ll think of something / I don’t know.

[What’s your final thought on this?]

[Laughter]

[S14] I was gonna throw something out there that maybe we could argue about

[S15] Ok.

[S14] But / um / I mean / some critics of drugs say that / it can be used as a gateway drug to other drugs

[S15] Ok.

[S13] This is true. That was one reason why I am against it / for that / aspect / I don’t know [Laughter]

[S13] No / I / I mean / I think that’s like / I mean / I don’t know if that’s true / but I think / from like what I’ve heard / that that like seems to be true / because / you think that because marijuana doesn’t have all of these side effects / it’s not / well / like / like / well / it’s not gonna give you like diseases / or anything / that’s what I meant / um / and / it’s not addictive / like / that could be the one where you could be like / oh / well like / I’ll try this / and then you’re like / oh / I like / I had some sort of drug and it felt great / and now I can like / try something else / like that turns out to be / not enough / um / so / if / I / I guess / what / I guess what / I guess maybe I can think of another reason why I would be against it / is that like / by legalizing it / it’s more / like / giving the message that like / it’s / it’s not / it’s fine / like you can / like you can do it / like it’s not like / it’s not bad / and / I know that / like / as a little kid / you see / like adults smoking cigarettes and drinking / and you’re like / that’s fine / it’s just kinda like something you do when you grow up / so it’s like / if that’s like / legalized / it’s gonna just be another thing / so then / like / now we’ve like put marijuana in that category that it’s fine to do that / so now / then / like / what’s next / like now we still have / people aren’t going to be satisfied / like / there’s gotta be something that’s gonna be like / the bad thing that you can do / like / so / if now we put like / cause at least most / well not most people / like / a lot of people / I would say a lot of people that smoke pot are content with like / doing that / like they don’t need to do another drug but if we take / their drug / and / put that / as like being ok / now like / more people might do it / and then / there’s not / then they lose the thrill / and they want / now more people might look for something else to do instead that’s gonna give them like / the thrill of doing that illegal thing

[S15] That’s a valid point. That’d be funny if they illegalized cigarettes and legalized marijuana.

[S13] Um / I don’t know if they could do that.

[Inaudible]

[S14] Well / just to comment on your comments

[S13] My long speech [Laughter]

[S14] And my own comments / um / well / you said / that / um / legalizing it sends a message to / children about what they should and shouldn’t do / but / I mean / by the time that a child gets to an age where like / I mean / the child’s not gonna be smoking at like age 10 / I mean 

[S13] I mean / people now smoke at age 10

[S15] Yea / a lot of people do

[S14] Well / they also do other things / like

[S13] Yea.

[S15] Yea / that’s true.

[S14] Um / and / I don’t know / I mean / I guess like / I don’t know / but by the time they get to the point where they can really make this decision / like / for themselves about it / they should already know / like / about the government / and about like / ya know / they should be reasonable enough to make their own decisions / like this is not / I don’t know / and especially if we legalize it / it’s probably not going to be as much of a problem for younger children / and / also / about what I said / about it being a gateway drug / um / that’s not true / um / sure / like / people who smoke / like things worse than that / I mean / cocaine / heroine / all that / they would do that anyway / whether or not they had smoked pot / it just makes sense for them to smoke pot / if pot wasn’t there / they would’ve just / have gone to like heroine or cocaine first / um / and / ya know / there’s a statistic / that was mentioned on the blog thing / by the / discussion starter or whatever / that said 40% of Americans have like / um / admitted to trying marijuana / and / like / if marijuana was really a gateway drug / we’d have like such a huger problem with it / and like / not only that / but / I mean / these forty percent surely were experimenting / and just seeing what was out there / I mean / we should actually be like / thankful / that marijuana is here / because / it’s / like such a like / I don’t know / it’s not that hard a drug / so / if it wasn’t here / those 40% of experimenters would be trying other things / which would not be good for them / so / let’s just thank G-d that 40% of Americans haven’t smoked rocks

[S15] I don’t agree when you say that / it’s not a gateway drugs / because / you can’t just say it’s not because I’m sure it is for some people 

[S14] Well

[S15] And / I mean / I know that there’s gonna be some people out there / like / I have personally known people who smoked pot and be like / I want something more / I’ve known a lot of people actually / and they were all like / I don’t know / not in good situations / obviously / but / so you can’t just like come out and say it’s not a gateway drug 

[S14] What I’m saying is / if pot didn’t exist 

[S15] Well I’m not sure if they would have actually / to tell you the truth / just knowing like their personality types / and knowing these people / I don’t know if they would have / it / it’s / you / you couldn’t really do that study unless marijuana wasn’t here / and you can’t ever do that / so

[S13] This is like going away from the gateway drug thing / but / um / not even like talking about like driving while you’re high or anything / but what about / like / just if marijuana was legalized / what sort of regulations would be put on it because cigarettes / you’re allowed to smoke like / whenever you want / you now just / we’ve put in like regulations / that ya know / like certain office buildings / like ya know / you can’t smoke inside / you have to go outside / or like / you can’t smoke in bars in certain states now / but / what sort of laws would be / put into effect with marijuana because / like / you can / I think you could link it / like you might think of it more as like / oh / like you can just go smoke on your break / but / like you can’t just drink on your break from work / like

[S14] Well / why would / I don’t know see how we would have different standards for / like / pot / than / like / I mean / if you come back from your break high / I mean / you’re just gonna get fired / that’s your own stupid fault [laughter] / like / I mean / and I think that the regulations are gonna be / I mean / very similar to / ya know / the regulations on alcohol right now / um / I mean / I’m sure you wouldn’t be able to buy it / or like legally smoke it / until like / a specified age / like 18

[S15] Would it be 18 or 21? Because like
[S14] [Laughter] Well / I mean / there’s also a question of whether alcohol should be 18 or 21.

[S15] Right.

[S14] But / I don’t know / I think those are like / things that can be worked out / I mean / I’m also sure that there would be places that you couldn’t smoke / it wouldn’t be legal to smoke / I’m sure it wouldn’t be illegal to sell it / or / and I’m sure that you could only buy certain quantities of it / and I mean / these are the way that / um / bars in Amsterdam work / and / like / it seems to be working for them really well

[S15] Like / prostitution is legal over there [Laughing] / like do you think that should be 

[S14] Well / I mean / that’s / that’s a whole different subject with whole different implications

[S15] Yea / but / for it to like work / I don’t know

[S13] I’d have to see a good proposal on if they legalized it / what the laws would be / in order to make judgment / and decision / I’d have to see both sides

[Laughter]

[S14] Well / I mean / certainly before they / ya know / legalize it for the entire population / they gotta start / like / I mean / first it would be only like / legalized for medicinal purposes / and you’d have to have a note from like your doctor to get it / um / I don’t know about growing it / I don’t know how that would work / but I’m sure that / ya know however many congressmen

[S15] Can’t people grow their own tobacco?

[S14]  I don’t know 

[S13] I feel like no / but I’m not really sure

[S15] Um / if you like legalize it for medicinal purposes though / like / I mean / there’s like / a little like underground market for people get like certain painkillers prescribed to them / and then like sell them / and / um / I don’t know / they’re gonna run into like similar problem with that / but / I mean / I guess you have to figure out how big of a problem is that really / cause it’s already readily available / like you could get it if you want it / like / which / I guess is kind of / makes it almost / like / silly to debate this whole thing because / if you want / to get your hands on any kind of drug / like you can / which / I guess then / that’s why you would say / at least if it’s regulated by the government / I don’t know / I don’t really know what I think about this / so 

[S14] I mean / just on that point / the / I mean / what legalizing it would do would be taking / ya know / the money out of the hands of like / the drug dealers and / ya know / actually giving it to the government / I don’t know how I feel about that / but like / I don’t know

[I think we can stop here. Ok. End of Discussion]
