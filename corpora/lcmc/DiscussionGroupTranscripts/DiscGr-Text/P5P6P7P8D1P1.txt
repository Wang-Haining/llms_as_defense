PRIVACY RIGHTS

[ID Number, D1P1. Is everyone ready to begin?]

[S7] Uh-huh

[S5] Yea

[Ok. Recently school officials prevented a school shooting because one of the shooters posted a Myspace bulletin. Do you think that this was an invasion of privacy? Who would like to begin? Anyone?]

[S8] Alright

[Number 8?]

[S8] Yea / I don’t really think it was an invasion of privacy / considering they posted a Myspace bulletin I think you’re kind of setting yourself up for that one / if you’re gonna kind of setting yourself up for that one / if you’re gonna post it somewhere open / in the open where anybody who you’re friends with / or / even anybody in general has access to that / so 

[S7] Um / I like totally agree with that / because / I know I have / um / people in my high school got in trouble / and expelled because of things that were on Facebook and MySpace / so / with putting things out on MySpace / even though it is / like / um / password and user name / ya know / protected / anyone can get one / so 

[S5] I agree. [Laughter] For the same reasons 

[S6] I think it’s kind of like a bulletin board / that’s like being angry for somebody reading your blog

[S8] Yea

[S6] Or something like that

[S5] What did they get expelled for / posting?

[S7] Um / pictures of / them / it was like girl on girl / like / sexual things / it wasn’t like sexual like their clothes off / but it’s an all girls Catholic high school

[S5] And they were able to get expelled for that?

[S7] Uh-huh / because it gives the school a bad name

[S5] Oh / wow

[S7] And our school doesn’t accept stuff like that / so / it’s ok if it’s like in your walls but once it gets / like / within the school / cause I know I got suspended for something like that / but it was within the school / but / it was / once you put it out / like / there / on Facebook or anyone 

[S5] Uh-huh

[S7] Cause teachers have Facebooks / and it got to the point that / you couldn’t on Facebook / you couldn’t put like / here’s a teachers name and here’s a quiz that you’re taking

[S5] Uh-huh

[S7] You have to like / you have to take any type of identification of the teacher / off of Facebook / so / got a little crazy [inaudible]

[S5] Yea / I think it’s one thing to keep in your own mind / but it’s another thing to post it somewhere in public / where / everybody can see it / I mean / you can’t really bust somebody for what they have in their mind / because / you can’t think for them / or / hear their thoughts

[S5] See / I don’t think they should have gotten expelled / for that though

[Can you elaborate a little bit on why?]

[S5] Why I don’t think / I agree with you / like / ya know / it’s people / I guess / it’s like / not that / I do that type of stuff / but / I guess / those people were kind of expressing themselves

[S7] Yea

[S5] In some way / like / it was / whatever / but / I mean / maybe get reprimanded or get something / have to do / something with the school but I don’t think they should have gotten expelled 

[S6] Are you talking about the students from her school?

[S5] Oh / from her school

[S6] Ok

[S5] Oh yea / no / I agree / like / with them / coming in on like a gun shooting / something like that where it could be physically harmful but / when they have this / it’s / they got expelled / and / did the kid in the situation even get expelled? Do we even know?

[I’m not sure. It’s kind of vague]

[S5] So we can’t even

[S6] There’s a big difference between what private schools can do to their students and what public schools can do though because

[S5] Was that a public school / with the My / the shooting / that situation?

[S6] Yea / with the MySpace situation / I think it was a public school.

[S5] Ok

[S7] I know private schools are a lot stricter

[S6] Yea / they have a / they have their own little domain

[S7] Yea / they’re like / all up in your business / ya know / you basically get no type of privacy / as soon as you put down a High School’s name / your privacy is gone / so / that sucks

[S6] There was an incidence at my high school where / um / somebody / cause I went to a Catholic high school too / and somebody created / like / a mockup webpage / that was a parody of our home / our high school homepage 

[S7] Oh

[S6] And they took like the school seal and like made it a marijuana leaf / and everything / and / the administrators found it and the kids got suspended for a really long time

[S5] Were you a public school or private?

[S6] Private 

[S5] Private?

[S7] Well / at least they got suspended for it / but / I mean / it wasn’t even like they were just doing it / because / I mean / there’s no guys there / so / you just / kind of found a girl and just was like / well let’s do this / and just / it was just like for the fun of it / you know / that’s so / I don’t know / it was just real stupid / I was like / it’s just real fun / and I feel like in Catholic schools you are not really allowed to have fun / it’s all about like / they’re getting real strict about it / you can’t have / your hair color needs to be natural / no streaks no out there things / you have to have one inch solid headbands / I’m like / y’all want everyone to be real uniform / I’m like / you’re giving no one their individuality / and it’s like you’re making like a little cult / of / I don’t like that / but

[S6] Of plaid

[S7] I’m glad I’m gone / that’s all that matters [Laughter]

[Number 8, do you have anything else to add to that? Or anything?]

[S8] I guess / when it / when it comes down to something like / any of these situations / you’re posting everything on a public server which gives / I mean / plenty of people access to it / it’s not really / it’s not really anybody’s server so / you’re school can’t say like / oh / I don’t know what I’m saying / oh / it’s not like your server / so if the school like goes and sees it / they like / you can’t say / oh / but it’s mine / so 

[S7] Yea

[S8] You invaded my privacy / it’s really / someone else’s and / they have full access to that / so / like there was a situation one time in my / high school / someone / he posted a blog online which / he had a list of names / and it was basically like a hit list / that he was planning to carry out / but / he got caught / someone searched his name on Google and found it / found that site / and / yea / that must have been scary for him / but / yea / they reported it to the school and / he got expelled

[S5] And he was expelled?

[S8] Yea

[S7] Well he deserved that one.

[S8] Yea

[Number 6 do you have anything else to say about that? Another thought?

[S6] It just seems to be that there’s a difference in forums / like / if you’re writing in your diary / or your journal that’s one thing

[S8] Yea

[S6] But / when you’re posting that kind of stuff online / like you said / anybody can see that or anybody can access it / so 

[Ok. Um / where do you think school officials should draw the line as to whether or not they are invading privacy?]

[S5] I think / they should draw the line kind of where we had it / like / when if it / if it could physically harm someone / then I think the line should be drawn / but / like / stuff / what happened in your high school / not to / how they’re expressing themselves / I don’t think the school should really be able to have a say / in / something like that

[S8] I think that’s a big problem / a big issue / I mean / the schools don’t / a lot of school officials don’t tend to understand / like / what’s the difference between someone expressing themselves and someone who’s like actually plotting something / in the background

[S7] Cause I think school officials / oh / I’m sorry / go ahead

[S8] Oh / ok / well / they like to / I don’t know / they like see someone dressed a certain way or something / and they choose to progress and like kind of invade on their territory to try to figure out what’s in their mind / even though it could just be some like really nice person / just

[S7] Having fun

[S8] Yea

[S7] Yea [Laughter] / I mean / cause I feel like / they just keep / I don’t know / I feel like school officials just / like see everything black and white / ya know / and / they / school officials think / ya know / I’m an adult / so they forget what it’s like to be a kid / and they forget like the changes that kids are going through / and / ya know / what / just / like / that stage of / I don’t know / and they think that / as a kid you’re supposed to have that stage of / I do know / as adults do / and that’s just not fair to kids / it’s like they want them to grow up / and / it’s not their time yet / they’ll have to allow to the kids to go through the stage of / you know / feeling out everything / trying everything / and / as long as it don’t kill you / I don’t see the point of / ya know [Laughter] / ya know / have fun

[Do you have anything to say about that?]

[S6] Um

[In response to what / number 7 was saying]

[S6] I mean / traditionally / the / the / like / in [Inaudible] Law and stuff like that / the line has been the difference between private and public forums / as to what school administrators can look at / when making those kinds of decisions / like / um / there have been a lot of cases about / like / people wearing in t-shirts and stuff like that to public schools and that’s a form of self expression / but / at the same time / it’s inflammatory / and while they might not be trying to commit an act of violence / you know they are provoking other people to that / so / ya know / that’s a tricky line to draw and I think it’s gotten more complicated because of the internet

[S8] It’s definitely getting more complicated because of / um / other situations like Columbine and all of that / I mean / that just / after Columbine and several other school shootings, schools just started cracking down / and / with an iron fist / and / just kind of trying to root out all the / possibilities / trying to make sure it doesn’t happen again / I mean / it’s a good cause / but / sometimes they have to learn when they’re going too far as opposed to when they’re / actually getting something done 

[S5] Uh-huh

[S7] Actually / it’s kind of like a parallel / like / the kids have to learn when things are going too far and so do the adults have to learn when things / when like / when they’re invading too much of their privacy / and kids gotta learn / well / ya know / maybe I’m showing too much stuff here / and / I mean / it’s also just the fact that / with my situation / with my high school / we had the same situation / earlier / cause like / this girl / um / brought a knife to school by pure accident / ya know / she’s the smartest girl in the world / smartest, real active / just brought a knife to school / and / I forgot the reason why / but she got expelled because of it / and she had no intention of doing anything with anyone / it’s just / she just brought the knife to school by accident / I don’t know if it was in her car / she wanted to keep it safe on her / and they went through her stuff / left her stuff on the bus / went through her stuff / and / they had no reason to / they just saw it there and decided to go through it / and then they found it

[S8] Yea / I think that’s a big of an invasion of privacy

[S7] Yea

[S8] I mean 

[S7] That’s not fair / I was like / you guys can file serious lawsuits off of stuff like that

[S6] Again / a private school though / they can pretty much go through whatever they want because they technically own the bus / and / and anything on the bus / they have / they’re able to search because that under the law / like / private schools can go through your locker at a whim / where as public schools can’t do that

[Number 5, do you have any response to what they were / saying / or?]

[S5] No / I think it was basically said

[Ok]

[Um / did you guys want to elaborate a little bit more on that example that you brought up?]

[S8] Which one?

[About the Columbine / um / how that / maybe that’s why they need stuff like this now]

[S8] Oh / yea / because / um / I mean / after Columbine / you did / there was an increase in school shootings and all of that / like / it’s impossible to say that it / I mean / there were several that followed it / people following in their footsteps / I mean / they definitely need to heighten the security / but / they don’t need to go as far as they are going in some case / where they take it to extremes / like / where they have like schools in lockdown so they can do locker searchers every / every like week / I mean / that’s just a bit / that’s just / going overboard / I think / a little bit

[S7] That’s like pressing the students / like / you know we’re gonna do it / so / you know / you know we’re gonna check your lockers / you know we’re gonna be all up in your business / so / that’s giving them a reason / like / well / um / if we know they’re gonna do it this day / then let’s try and do it another day / and just see if they can get away with it / it’s like kind of provoking them and trying to find a / something to beat them / or beat the system at

[S8] And I think imposing way too much security also / like / kind of like / puts too much control over people / I mean / if someone feels like they’re being oppressed / they’re probably going to act out against that / so / I think that sometimes it can actually worsen the situation / and increase the risk of that actually happening

[Any other thoughts on / anything that we’ve talked about? No?

[Ok. End of interview]
