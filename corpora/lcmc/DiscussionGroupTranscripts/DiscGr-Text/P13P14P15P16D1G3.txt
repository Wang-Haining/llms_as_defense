GAY MARRIAGE
[Alright, is everyone ready to begin? Yes? Okay.]
[While some states have legalized gay marriage, others are still opposed to it.  Do you think either side is right or wrong and why?]
[Who would like to begin?]

[S16] Um / I think that’s another invasion of / I don’t know uh / It’s an invasion of freedom I guess cause if you are trying to say that everyone is equal then I would think that if two / if two guys wanted to get married they should / be able to if they wanted/ they should / if they / the only problem with making it legal is that / um [PC1]/ people could take advantage of it like if two straight guys just get married for the benefits of it and / I don’t know it could be abused I guess / but there might be some way to filter that out.

[S15] I think that the problem about it is that / it’s like the religious aspect.  So I think if they called it something other than marriage more people would be like, ok.  It’s not like marriage in the traditional sense / it’s [inaudible] for a lack of a better word in like the modern sense.  And so I think more people would be like this is what they want and it doesn’t really conflict with my views on like / whatever religion it is that they are and / um / then it would be like more like accepted since its like a different culture aspect almost.  But / um / as into like what types of states / like / is it what type of states have it and why?

[Just how you feel about it / um / Different states are either opposed to it or for it and what you guys feel about that either way ]

[S15] I know like / I’m pretty sure it was like New Hampshire that like has it. Might be wrong on that / but / um / if you think about it they’re more of traditionally like a liberal state from what I remember and I guess / it’s not to like stereotype liberals but like / they’re more open to like ideas even if the names stays the same.  So if you / have like a different / like I was saying before / like a different like way of putting them together / like two women or two men together and like calling it something different and having it a little bit different than like a traditional marriage then I think it would be more accepted because it wouldn’t really conflict with anyone’s like personal /

[S16] They would / They would still feel / I would think that they would still feel that they’re not equal cause like they’re / like why can’t theirs be called a marriage? Like it / if it’s just based on / on the church’s view / that’s also / that shouldn’t be / cause like there’s supposed to be separation of church and state / so it should just be like a legal thing that they should be allowed to.  Even if they can’t in churches / like whatever, you can still get married outside of a church.

[S14]  I feel like / if like you call it something else / I mean that’s a direct violation of uh / ya know their right to get married / I mean / Why shouldn’t they have the right? Because it was ordained in some council like / a thousand years ago that marriage was the right of the church to decide / um / I mean that makes this a hugely like conservative liberal debate because I mean the conservatives want to uphold / ya know / tradition thousands of years and liberals are all about social change / So I mean, in that regard I feel like leaving it up to the states to decide is like the better course of like action right now.  Making it a federal law would be stupid.  And I feel like my personal beliefs are I don’t care, they can do what they want but it’s better to leave it to the states right now.

[S13]  I think in terms of like what you call it versus like the state versus the church / like there is a separation of church and state. And even / I know the Catholic church doesn’t necessarily / if you get married not like in a physical church / like you can’t do that within the Catholic Church.  So there’s like a difference between / you have to get married/ you get legally married and you’re also married by the church, so / 

[S15] Yea, that’s what I thought I was getting at more or less.

[S13] Uh huh, Yea, so / But like if you get married like by the state or like by a judge or something like that / that or like the marriage certificate that you get that’s called a marriage certificate / but you still / if you want to get married in the Catholic Church have to do like the whole Catholic Church thing on top of that so / I think like that a gay marriage would just be / obviously you wouldn’t have the catholic church aspect of it but you would just like have the legal part / so I think it could still be called a marriage because / 

[S15] Yea, I guess that’s what / that’s what I was trying to get at / but I didn’t like have the terminology or I didn’t think that way of putting it / but / yea / that’s exactly what I was getting at.  The separation of church and state is like a huge part and like I guess if you don’t conflict with like the church or whatever religion like cause it’s just not Catholics that believe that /um / then like people would be like, ok well they’re not trying to change my religion / or me views or like my culture / this is their views and their culture and I can accept it because they’re accepting mine and they’re not really stepping on anyone’s feet and so / yea.  But I agree also / the state should be like the one deciding because if it’s like up to every individual or town or whatnot it could be like so crazy.

[S14]  Yea / to respond to / that [PC2]you said / I just want to agree I mean / there are more churches than just the Catholic Church and first of all if I believe that you’re a gay in the Catholic Church you should probably find a different church because / um / I mean the Catholic Church is very rigid / very / ya know/ traditional / um / but I mean / I know plenty of gay people who have / well I don’t know plenty of gay people who have gotten married but / I’ve like heard of / ya know / churches that will do that and I mean / just because the heavily like / the believers who feel like this is somehow impeding their sacred vows of marriage / like / I don’t really think that’s a valid argument at all.

[S16] Um / forgot what I was gonna say / oh / um / I was just thinking about how so many / politicians have / they make decisions based sometimes on their religion and they might not mean to do it, it might just be like ingrained in them from / from um childhood or whatever / you can’t really tell them to make decisions without basing anything on their Christian morals or something but / you can’t really do that / but / I / voting / if you wanted to vote / it’s kinda hard to vote for someone who is going to be completely unbiased / religion wise because pretty much everyone has / a lot of people have religion.  And um I don’t know if you could really avoid that too much / like if you have a republican senator running your state you’re most likely not going to have gay marriage. It’s just / the way it is /

[S13] Back to what you were saying about / um / like it being a state thing versus a federal thing / um / if it’s / like if gay marriage is legal / in like a couple of states / like / is that enough? Like could people who want to get married / could they just like go to that state? Or is it gonna be /

[S15] I think that once they leave that state it’s not recognized

[S13] Oh is that it?

[S15] By some / some of the states / isn’t that the case? I could be wrong.

[S16]  I know when Massachusetts or New Hampshire one of them / when they legalized it like gay people from all over were going there to get married.  

[S13] Right, yea yea.

[S16] But I don’t know.  I / I thought it was just recognized by every state but maybe it’s not.

[S13] Do you think maybe it’s like for tax purposes and everything you have to be living in that state?

[S16] Maybe

[S13] Or / Cause otherwise / then like it / it seems / like if it is recognized / I mean if it is / I don’t know / on the one hand it seems like it’s weird that it wouldn’t be recognized in other states but / on the other hand if it is recognized by other states then could you just go that one state and get married and then go back to where you were? Like / and then like why would we need a whole bunch of states to legalize it? I don’t know.

[S16] At that point like / if you could do that / and like if you could just go to any other state and have it like recognized by the whole country / at that point you might as well just like legalize it everywhere

[S15] Right, Right

[S16] Like if someone / it’s just making it more of a hassle for people like they have to get to the state 
[laughter]
[S15] I’m pretty sure / cause I have a lot of like older people who are / like my friends / and they’re like gay or lesbian and they have partners / but I’m pretty sure / like / my state doesn’t recognize if they would get married / like it wouldn’t recognize it so / I could be wrong on that but I don’t think that they do.  But / um / like sure / if that’s what they want  I would like to see them happy but / I don’t know / I guess it’s like / it’s a tricky topic because / a lot of people are so set on like if like we legalize this it’s going to create a dominos effect and everything is just gonna like change / but / I don’t know
[S16] I don’t really see how anyone would have the right / to / to even say like / to / to not make it legal / like I / I / saying that they can’t get married / I don’t know / it just doesn’t seem right or / I don’t know / like even if you don’t like it / like the idea of gay people getting married / like it shouldn’t really / effect everyone else / like all the other people

[S14] I mean like / I don’t personally / I mean I don’t have a problem with gay people / I mean it kinda creeps me out sometimes but
[laughter][PC3]
[S14] I don’t care / like / and you see the people who are like / staunchly against this / you’re like what right of yours are you protecting by not allowing them get married? I mean at least with the privacy issue that we were just talking about / there’s some ultimate goal / some like / like reason why they’re invading our privacy / to stop terrorism and stuff like that / what is behind the opponents of gay marriage? I just / I don’t understand.

[S15] Like I was saying earlier / a lot of people it has to do with their religion / um / like / it’s / and like I said earlier it’s not just Catholics / like I’m pretty sure Jews are the same way and other / religions like a lot / um / how do you feel if gays or like lesbians get married then it goes against / like it’s a stab in like their back / saying like / oh my religions not be honored almost in a way or it’s being made fun of or something like that / so I guess that’s why I feel maybe if it’s called something different / like you can still say marriage but maybe if you have something else also

[S16] oh like a different legal name you’re saying

[S15] Yea / like

[S16] where people could just say like yea we’re married

[S15] right / but it’s kinda slightly different but like they’ll still get the benefits because they are married and like / they won’t offend anyone else because it’s not like stabbing someone else’s religion back in the back / it’s not like its own religion / but it’s different / so

[S16] I don’t know / I honestly think that people who have a problem with it because of their religion should just / they need to like just learn to get over that cause it’s not their religion / if they want any kind of separation of church and state then they have to just get past that / or else it’s never going to happen

[S14] um / a couple of points / first one is / I mean/ there already are not like officially marriage / like agreements, contracts whatever / between two people like in every state / maybe this is between a man and woman too if you’re not religious / I don’t remember what they call this right now / like a civil union or something

[S15] it’s like you live seven years or something

[S14] but um / also / I mean / the people who feel like this is some kind of like / making their religion unpure or something / like I hate the like break it to the Catholic Church but thousands of years have made your religion unpure and like / I mean / the crusades / I don’t like to bring up the crusades cause it’s so cliché but

[S16] non-involvement during the holocaust 

[S14] I mean / do these things make your religion unpure? Like do the actions of others affect what you believe ? I don’t think so.  Like / it shouldn’t make a difference.

[S16] I think / I think / a lot of people will also just use religion as an excuse / like they might just say like two gay guys are just gross 
[laughter]
[S16] like they might think that’s just gross and then they’ll just say it’s against my religion / I think a lot of people do that / so if you / if like they were telling the truth they would probably say that 

[S15] Yea / that’s a good point though / like / if people just don’t like something they’ll just say / oh well I don’t believe that so I can’t / or like / but / um / also in [inaudible] the crusades and everything / like / ok / I guess the reason why I’m trying to get it away just from Christianity and like slash Catholics it’s cause like / I don’t like it how like everyone always pins it on the Catholics or Christianity saying that / oh well they’re opposed to gay marriage so / let’s just like harp on them for not allowing it because a lot of religions in the past have been corrupt and like everyone always studies in history / oh the Christianty / the catholics / oh they had all these corrupt popes / but like there were so many religions before that and after that / now that are like / corrupt /  and like / it’s kinda glossed over / and so to pin it on like / one religion stopping gay marriages from happening / I don’t think it’s really fair but / I mean / I understand why it’s done because it’s like / what / all what people learn about in school.

[S14]  well / I’m not trying to say like / catholocism is like

[S15] No, I know

[S16] It’s pretty much anyone / who like / any religion

[S15] No, I’m not just saying that / like in general / cause like 

[S16] it’s like any religion that’s based on the bible / I think like / cause that’s where they think it’s said / a man should not lay with another man / whatever it says / I don’t know

[S14] Well /  I mean/ about that / um / you look in the bible you can find / and ya know / both sides of the argument / I mean you look in the bible  you can find anything you want to support whatever your opinions are

[S15] Yea

[S13] You can just read and take things in certain ways.

[S15] Exactly.

[S14] Also / just about / um / the Catholics / um / I mean I don’t want to pin it on just them but / like / this is America

[S15] Right

[S14] Where the majority of the population is / ya know / Christian / ya know / um / so / right now the people who are most / I mean this is just like factually / the people who are most opposed to it are like 

[S15] No / like yea / that’s because like / that’s like the majority are living here in America / but if you go like to another country you’re going to get a totally different reaction from a totally different religious group / so / I don’t know / I just / I just think how religions dictate everything

[S13] well I think the Catholic church is like / the most outspoken against it which is why / like / it’s always like / pinned on the Catholic church as opposed to it / or like outwardly opposed to it / I’m kinda changing the subject / but / um / I believe that there’s a law / like if two people are living together / for like

[S15] seven years

[S13] Yea / seven years / then they’re like considered legally married / um / now like / they wouldn’t be considered married by the Catholic church / but they’d be considered legally married

[S15] Right 

[S13] So  / would like the same rule apply to / like two males that are living together / I mean / I guess not / but if / if that / like / what about in a state where gay marriage is legal / would that law apply? And then / if so / like how do you distinguish like / let’s just say there’s just like two roommates / that are just living together / then / they like wind up being considered married / and like / I think that’s like more for taxation purposes than for anything else but / with the separation of / like church and state there’s a difference between a legal marriage and a marriage in  the church / so / if you really want to talk about a separation of church and state you can take / all the Catholic church’s opposition and all that and move that over to the church side and then when you’re left with the state marriage / like / I don’t / like what you were saying / I don’t see how you can say they can’t be married.

[S15] Yea 

[S14] For the / like taxation stuff / um / like that can be taken advantage of by anyone / like / it’s like / man and woman too / so 

[S16] Yea / men and women

[S13] Yea

[S14] it’s / I don’t know.

[S16] That could also be another reason why people are against it because they just feel like they’ll be losing money / somehow

[S14] Again / I mean / you have to pay taxes for everything / like 

[S16] uh – huh 
  
[S14] like / and / unfortunately/ the majority of our taxes are going to / like / the war right now / so / I don’t know/ there are a lot of things that / that like I’m opposed to / that I still have to support monetarily / but I just live with it

[S13] uh-huh

[Well how do you guys feel about President Bush’s push for a Constitutional amendment banning gay marriage? And do you think the Federal Government should be involved in this?]

[S13] On what basis is he pushing for this? Does anyone know?

[S15] From what I know it’s just his views / which I don’t think is good 

[S16] Fundamentalist crap
[Laughter]
[S15] I think / I don’t think there should be like a law against it / I mean that’s taking away someone’s freedom 

[S14] I think Bush should probably start /like stop trying to change the Constitution /  I think that’s a good document / the bill of rights / like

[S16] It was written by very smart people

[All] Laughter / Yea

[S16] [inaudible]

[S14] Like / the three words in the bill of rights / the most important word is rights / I mean / why would you have an amendment that says people can’t have rights?

[S16] uh-huh

[S14] it doesn’t / make sense

[S13] That’s very true
[Laughter]

[S14] Unless he’s on some kind of crusade trying to / like / break each of the original ten before
[Laughter]
[S14] his presidency’s over

[S15] I don’t think it’s [inaudible] / in that category / personally / so / I don’t think one has to really worry about that 

[S14] Especially like / not now / that / ya know Congress is now the majority Democrat

[S13/S15] Uh-huh

[S13] And what’s interesting too / like you have people who are very much opposed to it / but I think that / alright / hold on / let me start over  / um / you have people who gay marriage would actually apply to and that would only be gay people / and then you have / of like all the heterosexual people you have people w ho are very much opposed to it and other people who even though they wouldn’t really affected by any laws / like allowing or like / being against gay marriage they still realize that like / even though it doesn’t affect them they also at the same time don’t have a right to prevent it / so / I think that there’s like the majority of the people would fall into / like / not like the huge opposition category / so I don’t think that law could ever really get passed

[S16] Well / I just like / from what you just said / I just like / thought about how / um / like the one’s who are really for / like truly for gay marriage and are like willing to fight for it are gay people / like / you don’t see that many straight people fighting for it / but you see straight people fighting against it / so that like / kinda / I don’t know / it kinda like weakens their position / I don’t know / cause they don’t have like too much support / there’s more people opposing them than agreeing with them

[S13] Uh-huh

[S14] Hopefully a lot of / especially the Democratic / like / congressmen / probably got into office like with the support of like / homosexual lobbies / so / to go back against their word / I mean politicians do that but 

[Anything?]

[S13] I think we’re all pretty much [inaudible]

[Any final words from anybody? Summing up your feelings about gay marriage?]

[S16] I think we pretty much agreed that / there shouldn’t be a right to ban it / to illegalize it / that was like pretty much / the biggest solution that we came to

[S14] of course with all the like / with the Catholic church / I think / aren’t we debating that next time or something?

[Yea]

[Laughter]

[S13] inaudible

[Ok, end of discussion]

[Laughter]
[PC1]be sure to put slashes around both parts of “um” – usually that is a “thought” in and of itself, even if we do not know what that person was thinking
[PC2]“what” or “that”?
[PC3]is this several people laughing?  if so, type in “laughter” instead of “haha”
