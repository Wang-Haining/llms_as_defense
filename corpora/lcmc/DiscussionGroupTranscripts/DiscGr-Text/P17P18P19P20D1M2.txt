MARIJUANA
[Is everyone ready to begin?]
[S18] Yes.
[Ok. The city of Denver has decided to legalize small amounts of marijuana /[laughter] /
to persons over 21. How do you feel about this? I think I know who wants to begin.]
[S20] No, no. I will
[S18] That’s a momentous occasion in the history of the United States’ legal system.
[S17] That is.
[S20] Let’s get this out there. I’ve never smoked pot in my life. I just want to get that on tape.
[Laughter]
[S19] In case your parents are listening.
[S18] Yeah, yeah.
[S20] No, I seriously haven’t /so
[S18] Well yeah /I mean me too /but I’ve /I’ve come in contact with numerous people who have uh used is and I first hand have witnessed uh
[S19] The effects?
[S18] Well, yeah. You look at those people and you’re like wow /they’re having a good time but I mean you look at the kids here at Loyola /nowadays they usually /they get drunk every weekend /which just like pales in comparison /you don’t see some like stoned guy walking out urinating on the wall or like beating each other up so that the cops /I also know people who can uh operate heavy machinery and drive /quite well /actually probably better sober than when they’re high on marijuana
[S17] Better sober, or better high?
[S18] No, no. They’re better high [laughter]
[S17] Yeah. You said better sober [laughter]
[S18] Yeah /like can’t tell any difference /I’ve actually been in a car and halfway to where we’re going the person told me he was high on marijuana and I got scared for my life
[S17] That’s so scary /yeah
[S18] But then I realized there’s like no difference
[Laughter]
I mean I’ve seen numerous examples of the effects and I don’t think it even compares in degree to alcohol.
[S19] My high school was like stoner central U.S.A.
[S20] This is in New…?
[S19] New Hampshire. Yeah /pretty much everyone I know has at least tried it /and like in comparison to alcohol /it’s not even that bad /you don’t even like hear people dying of smoking too much pot.
[S17] Well, also like you have 
[S19] To smoke your body weight to die of an overdose whereas I know people that have had to go to the hospital because they’ve had their stomach pumped for drinking too much in one night.
[S18] Like I’m sure you could get high and then do stupid stuff.
[Laughter]
That may lead to death but
[S17] I was gonna say we don’t have like a fair means of comparison because one is legal and one is not so there’s the whole like adventuresome behavior of trying marijuana that’s not really associated with alcohol because it’s legal.
[S19] But then it’s not legal until you’re 21.
[S18] Yeah, yeah I was
[S17] Well for college students overall.
[S18] Yeah, but for the /I mean /ya know the same thing /if you’re gonna uh /probably uh the demographic of people who are venturing to try marijuana for the first time I would say closely correlates to the demographic who are trying alcohol for the first time
[S20] Probably a little less.
[S18] Well, no. Marijuana the first time? No /they’re probably trying the same age group as those who are trying alcohol for the first time and I would say that’s well under 21. I mean so it’s still illegal no matter which way you cut it.
[S17] Yeah, but alcohol becomes legal, and marijuana doesn’t.
[S19] Unless you’re in Denver.
[S18] Here’s the thing. [laughter] Yeah true that. Yay, Denver. Anyways /but uh /there’s this one thing in like Connecticut ya know those you know you’re from blank when /one of the things is /for Connecticut in high school no one would buy you beer but you knew six people who could get you weed.
[S19] Yeah, exactly. My high school /people would be driving around trying to get alcohol but like /pot you like
[S18] Just ask your neighbor [laughter]
[S19] Yeah, it’s so easy to find. So
[S18] Which says something about the police system
[S17] That also says that people /if pot was so easy to find that they were still looking for alcohol /that says that you’re looking for what you can’t have. So that’s partially why people want to legalize marijuana /cause they can’t have it
[S20] Can you just repeat that one more time?
[S17] Um /like the fact that marijuana was so available /no I’m sorry /yeah, and that alcohol wasn’t but people still were looking for alcohol /shows that you’re looking for what you can’t have.
[S18] Then why would they smoke
[S19] Yeah /at the same time /I know
[S18] Why would they smoke? Why would they continue smoking if it was so easily accessible to them by your logic?
[S17] Well you’re talking about people who didn’t smoke and just wanted 
[S19] No
[S17] Oh ok, I missed something.
[S19] You wouldn’t go looking for pot if you didn’t really smoke /like the people /I don’t know /most of the people who drank /smoked /all the people who smoked drank /but a lot of people who drank don’t smoke so /I mean if you’re /I don’t know /I don’t really remember what I was trying to say
[Laughter]
I don’t know /the availability of marijuana is a lot higher /at least where I’m from than alcohol /because for starters /marijuana you don’t have to find someone to buy it for you /you can just go 
[S18] That’s not always /there’s always a corollary /I mean I don’t remember the last time my friend just like drove into the city /or to the docks and was just like hey give me a crate of weed please /there’s always a system
[S19] Well no. But like you know who sells
[S18] Yeah, ok. I get your point.
[S19] And people that I grew up with and used to be my best friends sell pot. So /I don’t know /it was just a lot easier to find if you wanted it than it was to get alcohol /cause when you’re in high school how many people do you really know that are old enough to get it for you /ya know?
[S18] Yeah /um /also with the legalization thing /I don’t think there’s very /I don’t think there’s enough people pushing to the legalization for marijuana /No I mean uh I don’t think that a lot of people that would be pressing for it are pushing for the legalization of marijuana because it’s so easily and so readily available /I mean they have no problem procuring it and using and not getting caught /I mean they’re obviously under no moral obligation to get it legalized first
[S20] Yeah, I totally agree with that. I mean my friend /uh /he used to smoke pot, but then he stopped/ there’s route 1 right by my house /obviously you guys don’t know what that is /I’m just referring to it just for myself [laughter] /but uh /it’s got a barrier in the center and he went down the wrong side when he was high /and he could have died and that scared the crap out of him /so, therefore experiences like that will make a person stop smoking /um /so like we said /um /um /pot won’t exactly kill you but it will make you do things that might kill you
[S17] It’s effects will.
[S19] Same thing with alcohol.
[S18] Yeah exactly. If you’re gonna legalize marijuana /I don’t think /I mean I don’t know what Denver is /Do you know what the exact law is with Denver right now?
[Not sure. Just small amounts.]
[S18] Yeah, small amounts. But then that’s possession right? I don’t think you can /they decriminalized possession I’m pretty sure to like a ticket /it’s not even a misdemeanor.
[S20] Yeah, I swear it’s like you can possess it /you just cant sell it or something
[S18] Yeah, you can’t sell it or smoke it.
[S17] Well, how do you get it then?
[S18] Yeah, exactly. It’s just if you’re like walking around /I don’t know /I guess you're walking around with a J or something and the cops stop you and want to arrest you /but um /I mean they’re obviously not gonna /if they full-blown legalize marijuana like they do alcohol I mean they’re still gonna be restrictions like alcohol /I mean if they catch you driving high they’re still gonna /hopefully they’ll give you like a DUI /I mean if they catch you with it /Yeah I mean and they’re not just gonna let you like /I don’t know /still there’s gonna be an age limit /still there’s gonna be all those same 
[S17] Stipulations.
[S18] Yeah, that alcohol has. Exactly.
[S19] It’s not just gonna be like everyone’s running free on the streets /smoking pot
[S18] Reefer madness
[Laughter]
[S20] Well, I /I was /I was in Germany two years ago /and there was somebody smoking outside the [inaudible] /which is uh the cathedral there /I mean who smokes pot outside of a church, ya know? /like there was like a head shop down the street /and uh I was watching T.V. two nights ago and this guy said he went to Europe for his honeymoon or something like that and they said in every single picture there’s either a drunk or stoned person in the background.
[S18] Well, let Europe do what they want.
[S20] No, no, but I’m saying /ya know /the pot is also legal there as well as alcohol.
[S17] [laughter] The pot
[S18] The pot [laughter]
[S19] Their laws against drinking alcohol are also more liberal than our laws against drinking alcohol /so obviously their laws
[S17] Yeah, the drink is like under 16
[S18] Yeah, it’s a culture thing /yeah
[S19] Yeah, like obviously their laws with drugs are gonna be a lot more liberal /they /Europe all around is a lot more liberal than the united states.
[S18] Them crazy people over in Europe
[laughter]
[S17] When we had to write about this /I wrote about /um /like the addictive qualities of marijuana /because you don’t really have that with alcohol /well, you have it with alcohol /I’m sorry /but it’s the fact that marijuana is like a gateway drug so it gets you onto worse things whereas alcohol /if you develop a problem with alcohol, it’s only with alcohol
[S18] Well, I /I highly, highly disagree with that /from experience that I’ve seen /I mean if you define gateway drug /smoking cigarettes is a gateway drug
[S17] That’s true.
[S18] All my friends /I mean they smoke now /I mean oh little Timmy got a pack of cigarettes and then he’ll start to go behind school because it’s cool and you cough your lungs out and then you get addicted and there ya are /but as far as like alcohol /I don’t know a single person in my life who smoked pot and didn’t quite when they didn’t want to /and I’m talking about kids who do it more than daily /I mean /I think like whatever
[S17] But it’s still addictive
[S18] I just don’t believe that
[S17] You don’t think it’s addictive?
[S18] I think whatever research has done to prove it addictive should be re-conducted. Can you back me up on this?
[S19] I can. Like I know people who smoke pot like pretty habitually and could quit and those same people would still drink during still and on the weekends /like 
[S20] Vodka in a water bottle.
[S19] Yeah [laughter]
[S18] But, it’s also commonplace too /I mean /alcohol I would also consider a gateway drug /I mean like, like /any like level /if you like /I look at it in like levels /I mean at the very bottom there’s probably cigarettes cause short-term, whatever /then on the next level would be like alcohol and weed and then if people get bored with that level /but I mean like nobody goes to the car and says like yeah last night at the bar that was great let’s go to find some coke /like it’s the same thing with weed /I don’t feel like the people /I mean it’s there like to a certain extent yes /I mean when they get bored with weed they’ll start experimenting with other things /but that’s /that’s much more of a personal choice
[S17] I think it’s more of like the taboo of doing drugs /like once you’ve done it /like once you’ve done pot /you’re not scared of like cocaine or heroin or anything else
[S18] But, see don’t you think 
[S17] But if you drink, if you do alcohol /you could still very well be scared of drugs
[S18] But if they legalize marijuana, wouldn’t that only make it better?
[S17] Make it better for what?
[S18] Wouldn’t that only /wouldn’t that only make marijuana seem safer so it would like

[S19] Pull away the stigmatism
[S18] Well, yeah /like marijuana so far removed from that cool drug like ohh what is this that you’re feeling /is that what /is that what you’re trying to describe? /I mean the adventurous like let’s try to do drugs to see what it’ll do to us
[S19] And like part of the way marijuana works is that it’s so different from every other drug and even alcohol /it’s not like coke or even drinking that it builds up your tolerance /the more you smoke the less you have to smoke to get that same high
[S17] Right, but you’re still addicted to it.
[S20] Well, it’s mainly psychological actually.
[S19] I know plenty of people that have smoked pot and haven’t done anything else and would never do anything else besides that /Like
[S20] I think like /it’s a psychological addiction /it’s not physical definitely
[S18] Yes
[S19] It’s not.
[S20] It’s definitely psychological in my opinion. Uh, I know people /there are so many pot smokers in my uh English class /[laughter] /senior year of high school /it was stoner English class /like that’s what I referred it to or as /and I’m pretty sure my teach /well she was a dead-head [laugher] so she knows the effects, needles to say /but uh this kid was saying /he was breaking a sweat because he needed a joint in class
[S17] He said that? To the teacher in the class?
[S20] We were very open with our teacher.
[S17] He did really say that to her?
[S20] He didn’t say that to her exactly, no /he was like dying for pot because he hadn’t smoked it for two weeks and that was hard as anything for him
[S18] Then, in that case, I’d say it’s just like an alcoholic trying to quit. You bring yourself to that level of /I mean you don’t /it’s not like 
[S20] Plus ya know, it’s cool for him /ya know hey guys I really need some pot guys /I think I got the jitters /I need to smoke a J /ya know
[S18] Yeah, yeah /but it’s not like / I mean I could be wrong /if we have any doctors in here, correct me /but it’s not like crack like once you like try it your life will never be /like you’re using up chemicals in your brain that will never be there /I mean like you could get addicted to alcohol and you could get addicted to marijuana /I think it’s the same thing /if you’re a reasonable adult and you have self-control /you don’t become an alcoholic /if you’re a reasonable adult and you have self-control, you don’t become addicted to marijuana /and if you’re a reasonable adult and you have self-control, you don’t become addicted to cigarettes
[S17] Alcohol is a genetic disease though, it’s not all about self-control. Part
[S18] That’s true.
[S17] But, it’s very physical /the addiction is physical and people just spiral out of control /like if you’re an alcoholic and you relapse /you can’t stop
[S18] But see I never see
[S19] If you’re a pothead smoking and then you start again you’re not gonna like automatically go back into the cycle.
[S17] Well, that’s not the same as alcohol /I guess
[S18] Actually, alcohol would be worse in that case. Wouldn’t you agree?
[S17] Alcohol is definitely a physical and psychological addiction.
[S18] I think /the story I always tell /like /it’s not really a bonafide story to try and convert people, but it’s a humorous observation I’ve had /is like you never read about /I’ve said this in pretty much everyone of the three things /but you never really hear about some stoner Dad and coming home from work and beating his kid /I mean the worst that could happen is like little Jimmy is wondering why his Dad’s so tired and then gets overjoyed because he get treated like T.G.I.F. /to like T.G.I. Friday’s or something like that /I mean like I don’t /it’s just like you never really hear about pot-head /even, even in the campus police blogger /it’s always that same funny thing /the police bust into the room and what happens? /they find some green leafy substance [laugher] /everyone knows those three little words /but like it’s /I mean /I mean yeah /I don’t know /I just haven’t /I haven’t seen enough bad things come out of smoking marijuana to 
[S19] I mean, I really think it being illegal has caused more problems than it being legal /I mean I’m not saying that it should be legalized because I wanna go out and smoke marijuana
[S18] Yeah
[S19] I just think that like it’s not really doing any harm to legalize marijuana /it’s not gonna make other drugs legal /it’s not gonna make people wanna do it more /it’s just gonna take away the ridiculousness of putting people in jail for marijuana which isn’t any worse for you than drinking alcohol and like
[S18] Maybe better for you
[laughter]
[S19] I know.
[S20] Going back to the violence issue though with alcohol /I know a kid /I don’t know if you guys heard this in police blogger or not, but he was like lying down on the ground because he was drunk out of his mind /got up /well, no excuse me /passed out in York Road I believe or Charles Street /the cop pulled up behind him, parked his car so he wouldn’t get his because he was half way in the street /the kid got up and threw his forty at him /at the campus police officer /and then ran and fell down Notre Dame’s Campus /hid in the bushes for two minutes /then got up and got tackled and ya know /obviously taken down /that’s the whole alcohol thing /it makes people stupid /very violent [laughter] /sometimes /depends on the person /well, if you have self-control
[S18] I’ve seen kids who /one of my friends /there’s this mixture of friends of people who don’t smoke pot and people who do smoke pot and like every once in a while we’ll just be hangin out and some of them will go and get high and come back and we’ll just chill /and um /there’s this one kid /I mean he’s the antithesis of all my arguments /because this kid /he’s not like he’s smoking any insane amount of marijuana /he just get ripped man /I mean he’s like /I’ve never seen someone /I mean it’s a chemical /I guess it affects different people different ways just like /I mean small like skinny girls get drunk quicker than big, fat duded /but I mean people can do some stupid stuff on marijuana /but then again it goes back to the being controlled in a controlled place and a controlled time
[S20] A lot depends on the personality of the person as well.
[S18] Naa. I don’t think personality has anything to do with it.
[S20] Really? You don’t see like the stupid kid in class/ like the class clown /I could see him doing something more stupid than say like the straight A student going to smoke ya know some pot.
[S18] Yeah /Well yeah /exactly
[S19] A lot of people I know like that smoke marijuana /they /like the people that I know who are more relaxed when they aren’t on anything /they are more like outgoing and energetic and stuff like that /and I know people who are crazy when they’re normal/ and then when they smoke they just like sit there
[S17] Sounds like the same effects as alcohol.
[S18] Exactly, yeah.
[S19] And like I know a kid that /he was drunk and decided to drive his moped home from a party and he crashed into a telephone pole and almost died /like he had a full-ride into college playing lacrosse /but like he was in a coma for like a week and like it was terrible /he had to wear a helmet for like /he still might have to wear it /cause if anything happened to his head, he could die /and like just stupid decisions because he was drunk /but like I don’t have any personal stories
[S20] Wait he was drunk or he was high?
[S19] He was drunk. But I don’t have any stories of people smoking pot and then
[S18] Exactly.  That’s, that’s
[S19] But I know another kid that was drunk and driving and almost died /was like in the hospital /but I don’t /I don’t know
[S18] I don’t know if this has any /maybe you can help me out on this one? /I don’t know if this has any medical reference, but also if you’ve ever talked to a drunk kid and then said chill out the cops are coming /he’ll be like oh man, F the Cops, man! /if you ever talk to a guy or girl that’s high and tell them yo chill out the cops are coming/ they will come to attention/ I mean it’s like they’re in the United States army /I mean they will snap back to reality, everything /even the kid I was talking about who gets ripped /you just say like you chill and like a lap dog being trained for like animal planet
[S20] I was gonna say he’ll like hide under the table
[S18] Yeah 
[S19] Being high is a lot easier to hide though /than being drunk
[S18] Even in like a situation where you’d need to like protect yourself and protect your health /like it’s easier to snap back like /I don’t know if that has any medical like backup or anything like that /but from experience I’ve seen that if like bad things are about to happen /not only just getting in trouble but like as far as like someone’s well-being like someone can snap out of being high a lot quicker than /if you’re drunk I mean you’re drunk
[S17] Well you’re still high /you’re just not like displaying the signs of it /it’s still in your body
[S18] Yeah, I know. I totally agree, but I think you can control yourself more when you’re high as opposed to when you’re drunk.
[S17] Yeah, that’s a good way to put it.
[S20] And like your abilities aren’t always off. For instance
[S18] Yeah, they are. [laughter]
[S20] Well, no, they are. But you can still have some good ones. For instance /I hate to admit this /I lost to a high kid at pool over winter break /It was so sad. The kid beat me at pool and he was high. I was like what is this?
[S18] Yeah, but you have to understand /if someone like goes out to a restaurant /has a beer /they’re not gonna be like in a moral dilemma of whether to drive home /I mean if they’re over 21 it’s like oh I had a beer /I mean it’s to a little more extent when you’re like oh I’m just gonna smoke a bowl /I’ll be fine. But, I mean, there’s like different levels to /Right?
[S19] Yeah.
[S20] Let’s take it back to Denver /cause I think we kinda 
[S19] Digressed /What about Denver?
Well the question of Denver was just do you think it should be legalized.
[S18] How do you feel about it? /Actually, yeah / How does everybody feel about it? /That was the question right?
[Legalizing it /How do you personally feel about it?  In comparison to alcohol too /which you guys have been talking about]
[S20] What do you guys think? /Ya know if it’s just in Denver and no other states /that’s kinda ridiculous
[S18] What do ya mean?
[S20] Well I mean like why would it just be in Denver? If the national law is against it, then why are they making it legal?
[S17] Can they?
[S20] Exactly /it’s just a loophole
[S18] The federal government can do whatever they want. If they wanted to like crack down on pot /I mean /it’s not too hard for people to figure out
[S20] I mean for people to say /for glaucoma /for instance, my mom has glaucoma /um/ my mom’s not gonna smoke pot /I think that’d be hilarious, but not gonna happen /that would be funny /but she has to take eye drops every day for it /and that’s what she does /ya know /so
[S18] You’re against the medicine? Medicinal marijuana?
[S20] I’m saying /cause a lot of people say glaucoma, glaucoma /that’s why it should be legalized /that’s just their main excuse /I’d like to get people to realize that it should be legalized in their opinion /but there are different medical ways for it to um/ to treat glaucoma /so that shouldn’t be the sole reason
[S17] There’s really things that they know only marijuana can help /or so far/ they can help /I think that’s definitely a benefit.
[S18] I agree with Mr. 20 in the fact that if you’re gonna legalize it/ you shouldn’t /you shouldn’t use any like scapegoat /that’s not the right word
[S17] Rationalizations?
[S18] No /well rationalizations too /but you shouldn’t like put all your cards in one corner as far as why it should be legalized /it’s just like look I think it should be legalized because it’s not as bad as /like you shouldn’t try to hide your reasoning /well actually that works pretty damn good in California just because
[S20] Arnold
[S18] Yeah, good old Arnie.
[S17] Do you think it should be like a state or federal issue though?
[S20] I don’t think it should be /I don’t think the state should differ from federal stuff /I think like
[S19] I think in this case it should be Federal.
[S18] Ya think?
[S19] Because the whole war on drugs is federal.
[S17] Also with alcohol it’s federal [inaudible]. Well actually, this is kinda weird. I heard the age for alcohol used to be like 18 or whatever /and then 
[S18] It’s still 18 in some states.
[S17] [inaudible] and then they offered states money /who made it 21 /so like for almost every state it was better /it was more profitable
[S18] I don’t know if it was that /I think it was like
[S20] No, I think it was like that.
[S18] Yeah, there’s some like loophole like that /yeah
[S17] I think on the federal level it’s still 18, but every state has it 21 or something like that.
[S20] I do think every state does have it 21, but I think it was the highway thing because when I was in driver’s ed /they basically said they changed it from 18 to 21 so that people could get the facts of driving down before they could get alcohol into their system /before they have that feeling /so that was like the /I believe the sole reason for that /um which I felt was kinda ridiculous but /ya know /but I’m also selfish /so
[S19] You shouldn’t be drinking when you’re driving anyways /why does driving have anything to do with it?
[S20] Exactly /it’s like they automatically assume, but the majority of the population is not gonna do that.
[S17] Yeah. People know very much the dangers of drinking and driving /that’s like people have heard that message so many times.
[S20] Like you’ll get the 16 year olds who will do it [inaudible]
[S18] Actually, no. One of my best friends /first week he got his license /he drove drunk on the weekends just to see if he could do it [laughter]
[S17] Oh my God. That’s terrible.
[S18] That’s one of my best friends, and he’s /uhh /he looks back and he like scares himself with all the stupid stuff he’s done /so
[S20] Everybody’s got a friend like that.
[S18] In the same vain, I think there’s another interesting topic we could be covering up here is /um /there’s a lot of um legal drugs
[S20] Salvia.
[S18] Yeah, yeah. I’m talking about like stuff you could walk into a record store and get /forms of mushrooms
[S17] How are those legal?
[S18] Exactly.
[S20] Well it’s /it’s just politics /like I said before I was talking with my stoner friend /[laughter] /let’s call him /stoner friend Jack we’ll call him /that’s actually his name but um he was saying /I believe um the Native Americans /they has opium and then um
[S18] They had peyote. That’s a Native American thing.
[S20] No, no /I don’t know /there was like something where they had to legalize one thing .they had to choose one thing [inaudible]
[S18] Salvia since it is legal
[S20] It basically has the same effects as salvia
[S18] No, no, no, no.
[S20] That doesn’t shut off the paths to your brain somehow /so that if somebody says something, you believe it?
[S18] I don’t know what salvia chemically does. All I know, is that it’s a full-blown hallucinogen.  I mean if you /like /if you like talk to anyone who has done salvia about driving /well number one, it only lasts for like 5 minutes /but like they would just laugh because it’s just so impossible to /it’s like /I don’t even know /It would be like what mushrooms or LSD would be like. You’re completely removed from reality /like distorted from reality /Like do you know anyone who’s been on salvia in New Hampshire?
[S19] No, I never heard of it.
[S18] You’ve never heard of salvia? In New Hampshire? Really! Wow.
[S20] For instance, one of my really good friends here at Loyola /he’s not a stoner by any means /uh he smoked salvia once /his friend /you can call him like the storyteller basically /uh /what happened was /like you said it was a hardcore hallucinogen /he was sitting there ya know /he smoked the salvia and his friend was like alright you’re on top of a mountain /you’re climbing a mountain /so like /the kid thinks he’s climbing a mountain /this is horrible but it’s great at the same time /he was like alright /alright now you’re relaxed /you’re being mauled by a bear /and he starts screaming
[S18] See, that’s awful.
[S20] It’s horrible, but it’s great at the same time. He starts balling and thinks he’s gonna die /but he’s really just high /so
[S17] That’s scary. You can get someone to do anything.
[S18] But that’s the point I’m trying to make /like I mean /this is like /if like /what, what time is it? /What is it? Seven o’clock maybe? If I wanted to, I could drive down to Towson /get some salvia and we could all be like tripping like crazy by eight o’clock /and it would be completely legal for us to do that /and marijuana /we have the green leafy substance like in the/ it’s kinda ridiculous like as far as /yeah /that something like salvia is legalized and then marijuana which pales in comparison
[S17] I’d be interested to see what like someone who’s been addicted or had a lot of drug problems /like what they would say /There was an alcohol and drug speaker last night on campus, and he like went through a lot of really bad experiences /and like I don’t know if anyone was there but if I had known we were gonna be talking about this I would have asked him what his views are /cause some people who are recovering alcoholics or drug addicts view the substance that they abused at one point as the ultimate evil, and they are opposed to like completely /like I know recovering alcoholics who just absolutely oppose /even when you’re 21 /drinking /just full out/ but they also might see it as oh well I just did it because it was so taboo so it might be a good thing /although I don’t know how they would look at it
[S20] I did the uh fast and sleep out thing. I don’t know if you guys heard about that? /and /uh /they had 45 homeless people come in and previous homeless people who had all abused drugs /they’re all obviously against /um/ the legalization of marijuana /um /but /um /they were also the people who did admit they had no self-control /uh they were not mature enough to use the drug.
[S17] Did they get in trouble when they were really young? Cause I saw 
[S20] No, there were like moms and stuff.
[S17] Oh cause when I saw a similar panel /the guy was like 10 years old.
[S20] No, the youngest person on that little panel was 35.
[S17] No, I mean like when they started.
[S20] They probably started about our age /or maybe a little bit younger /maybe like 16ish
[S18] To get back to you addiction question /your addiction thing /um /one of my very good friends started smoking marijuana when he was 12 and it got to the point where he was just like /and he’s about what? /He’s like 18 or 19 /and he’s like /it got out of control for him /and he just quit cold turkey /hasn’t smoked in 2 months.
[S20] My friend who got high and drove on the wrong side of the highway started smoking cigarettes /um /which led to pot later /when he was 11.
[S17] When he was 11?
[S20] Yeah, he told his parents he quit, and then when they threw the cigarettes out he took them from the trash. [laughter]
He’d like steal them from their purses and things.
[S17] So he had been smoking marijuana before he was 10?
[S20] No, no he started cigs when he was like 11.
[S17] Oh, oh ok.
[S18] Which goes back to my cigarette as a gateway drug
[S20] But he /God, he only smoked for maybe a year throughout his life.
[S18] That’s still a long time.
[S20] Not compared to most of the people 
[S18] What do you mean, smoking weed or smoking cigarettes?
[S20] No /like he still smokes /he’s 18
[S17] Cigarettes?
[S20] Yeah.
[S18] Oh but he was only /he only smoked marijuana for a year?
[S20] Yeah, but then he had that experience which made him stop.
[S18] Yeah, exactly. I mean a year enough
[S20] It’s not constant though, it’s not bad.
[S18] Oh, ok.
[S20] I mean it’s not good for you. You’re inhaling smoke.
[You guys have any other thoughts? Ok. End of Discussion]
