GENDER/SEX DISCRIMINATION
[Alright, everyone’s ready to begin? Ok.  Do you feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the present day United States and if so what can we do to change this?]
[S20] Let’s just go around and
[S17] I /I think it’s still a problem.
[S20] Yeah
[S19] Yes
[S19] Ohh, we got some hesitation.
[S18] Well, I mean what do you want me to say? Gender discrimination? Of course there’s always gonna be gender discrimination.
[S19] I mean ever discrimination is pretty bad.
[S18] Every /yeah exactly every discrimination is gonna be prevalent, but we can get to that later /but we’ll see what your thoughts on that are
[S20] Yes
[S18] You concur with me or
[S20] There’s always gonna be discrimination. There’s always gonna be like that person /like /I still believe in this
[S17] I think that once you’ve established some kind of disparity /that you can never really fully recover
[S18] The south may rise again.
[Laughter]
[S19] Like there’s always gonna be that thought in the back of everyone’s head that women aren’t equal because they weren’t equal for such a long time /they still aren’t really /but they were seen as really being below men and that’s still gonna be residing in the back of everyone’s mind
[S17] The good thing is that there’s like a conscious effort to overcome that.
[S18] The thing is /there’s two main points in this /I mean 
[S19] [Laughter]
[S18] What are you laughing at?
[S19] I think it’s funny.
[S17]  You sound like you’re reading a 
[S18] Well, no I mean there’s like a point where we can look back /I mean it’s foolish to say we haven’t come a long way with gender discrimination /I mean at this point like it’s not like you can’t get this job /you’re a woman /it’s like get back in the kitchen /and if I say something like that it’d understood to be a joke and like I was in /before the discussion started the family guy jokes and they like parody it but to a certain extent when you parody something /you’re prolonging it and I mean you can never /you can never completely forget what’s been done before /so like as long as it’s up there you might as well parody it and /I mean you just have to be intelligent about it and you have to know that not to take it seriously /there’s another point I was gonna make /also there are some truth to every stereotype and don’t tell me 
[S19] There is, I’m not gonna lie.
[S18] I mean, number Miss 17 /you first-hand know that in the sciences and in mathematics who is like 
[S17] Yeah, but it’s not cause like you’re better at it
[S18] No, it’s not. It’s just cause like in /historically women have just /it just
[S17] That a historical condition /it’s not truth
[S18] Yeah, I know. It’s not that they’re worse at it /it’s just like /it's just like arbitrary statistics that not as many women are
[S17] That’s true, but
[S18] And you can misread that in anyway you want and anyway besides just looking at it as an arbitrary statistic is misreading it, but it’s /I mean it’s
[S19] Well in the same light like it is like scientifically men do have better brains when it comes to like math and sciences.
[S17] I don’t think they do.
[S19] Well that’s what /that’s what studied have said /and like women have better brains when it comes to like writing
[S20] In general you are smarter than me in math. I can guarantee you.
[S19] And like women have better /are better when it comes to like language and writing and stuff like that.
[S20] It’s this like different skills /it’s just natural
[S18] Probably coming from back in the day when women
[S17] They were treated like that.
[S18] Yeah, exactly /it’s just like /I don’t know /Greg Mendel /uh genetics /it’s not just physical stereotypes 
[S20] What there’s some like /alright I’ll say /I am a secretary and it’s weird to admit that sometimes because /[laughter] /there’s the whole
[S19] No, where I work there’s a guy day secretary too.
[S20] No, no /do people go up to him and ask him if he gets pinched on the butt?
[S19] [Laugher] No.
[S20] Yeah, yeah. People ask me that /I’m like no um 
[S19] Are you sleeping with your boss? 
[Laughter]
[S18] Exactly /like yeah
[S20] Do you wear a skirt to work? I’m like no I’m straight and I’m a guy so /um /it’s weird to admit because it is a very girly job
[S17] Do you call it like an office assistant?
[S20] I like to consider myself
[S18] An administrative assistant
[S20] Um /let’s see /desk management
[S17] Where do you work?
[S20] Um /Remax American Dream /the real estate company /and um /yeah so /I don’t know /it’s /it’s a good job obviously but sometimes /ya know I always joke about it /ya know /I’m a guy and I’m a secretary /ya know /um /it’s just the whole parody where like you make fun of it /ya know
[S19] It’s weird how when men take on feminine jobs they get made of but when women take on masculine jobs it’s fine.
[S18] Ohh /you can’t say that, man /ask any
[S20] Oh, I totally agree.
[S18] Female ROTC /any guy on campus will just shudder /it’s a shame but any guy
[S19] That’s kind of /I think war is on a different level
[S18] No, that’s an occupation.
[S20] What? You’re sayin if a guy sees a girl in the ROTC he automatically oh I’m not interested.
[S18] No, I’m thinking like without no face in your mind /right /you’re not thinking of anyone right now ok? /if I said girl that’s in ROTC /just like running through like the list of people in your mind like how many /I hate to say it but how many 
[S20] I just saw today /a pretty girl that was in ROTC and I was like that’s pretty cute
[S20] But you’re /first thing that comes to my mind is butch
[Laughter]
[S18] Exactly /cause there is /you are not like a /what is it? /a misogynist? /yeah / like you’re /you don’t like treat women badly /there’s /there’s truth to everything because you have to look at like logically there are some statistics /and I mean something like whether you find a woman aesthetically pleasing to the eye is kind of
[S19] But you have to be physically capable to be in the war
[S18] Wow
[S19] And a lot of /like you’re not gonna get a lot of little Barbie doll girls that are gonna join the army and be really good
[S18] No /I’m not sayin /but I mean I don’t want to get too off topic on here, but I’ll just drop this little bomb as like 
[S20] Pun intended
[S18] Hey / I’m not talking about like /yeah there’s some very beautiful athletic women out there /but um I’m talking about /some of these girls /I mean um I wonder if like their Dad hit them in the face with a frying pan /like
[Laughter]
[S20] Number 18, how could you?
[S18] That /that was a low blow /but see I’m making a parody of it /I mean it all comes back
[S17] But, it’s mean.
[S18] No, I have some very, very ugly friends /man /like but like it’s not like /you got /you gotta take everything in stride /you gotta take everything with a grain of salt
[S17] Alright. What about other things for women that don’t have as much of a stereotype but maybe like a science career or something?
[S19] Like doctor, lawyers and like
[S17] Yeah /yeah /like high up
[S18] Actually, if you flip that /think about the male nurse /the murse
[S19] Yeah /I was gonna say that /the male nurse
[S18] Yeah /yeah
[S17] I don’t know. I had a male nurse. He was like the nicest nurse I’ve ever had.
[S18] Yeah
[S19] Like stay at home Dads
[S18] Yeah, exactly /stay at home Dads
[S20] Full House
[S17] I think that’s more accepted. Wait what do you think is more accepted, the male in the female role or the female in the male role?
[S19] I think it’s more the female in male role /minus your ROTC example /is more accepting than the male in the female role
[S20] Can you repeat that one more time?
[S17] The female in the male role or the male in the female role?
[S20] Now look at it /um /look at sports /well a guy plays field hockey /what? /no that doesn’t happen /um then you look at 
[S17] Guys do gymnastics.
[S20] That’s gymnastics /I did gymnastics when I was like a kid
[S18] No, gymnastics is crazy, man.
[S20] Like those guys are jacked.
[S17] But, it’s a female sport.
[S18] But, I get what you’re saying and yeah /but like the WNBA /it’s like yeah good for them they’re doin basketball /yeah but if like a guy
[S20] It’s a masculine sport just by history.
[S19] If a guy is a gymnast /you’re just like ok
[S18] Well, that depends 
[S19] Like a ballerina
[Laughter]
[S18] Exactly
[S19] You’re like oh
[S20] No, I know a guy here who does ballet 
[S17] Really?
[S20] And it was like /he can dance like really well /and I never would of expected it /but then when he did it /ya know /it’s funny cause you’re not used to seeing a guy who can arch sweep /but then once he shows off his moves /I guess it’s more acceptable
[S18] I think the biggest like
[S20] If, if
[S17] It’s like once you get over the hurdle 
[S20] Well, it depends. If they’re really good at it then it’s very easy to accept /but then if they do it /I wrestled and there were girls who were wrestlers with us and that was really weird /I mean I’m not gonna like /a lot of people made fun of them 
[S17] Did you wrestle them?
[S18] Yeah?
[S20] Umm /I wrestled a girl once /maybe twice
[S19] So awkward
[S20] But it was in practice /so
[S18] Thank God. 
[S20] Now when they would get on the mat in a match /I had friends that would wrestle girls in a match and /ya know /I’m not gonna hide anything /we told them if you lose we’re gonna make fun of you because you just lost to a girl and it’s just stereotypes /it’s society today still
[S17] Would guys try to be like easy on them?
[S20] When they got on the mat /no /because if they lost
[S18] If you lose, man
[S19] I think I would look down on a guy who lost to a girl in a wrestling match, and I’m a girl. Like
[S20] We actually /well actually we didn’t make fun of him /we had a kid who got annihilated by a girl and 
[S17] But, if the girl’s really good
[S20] She was terrific. She had a firm handshake /like I shook her hand and ya know /it was /not like /and she looked like I guess you could say an athletic Barbie doll /that’s what she looked like /and I was like /but then she always looked pissed off and she had a really firm hand shake /everything that the eye saw was totally wrong and when that kid lost I guess it was more like he must feel horrible so we’re just gonna let it be /and like we’ll just leave it at that
[S17] Was he the only one that ever lost a girl?
[S20] I’m not sure. I may have witnessed one other time. But, I also saw a kid lose to a blind kid, but that’s a different story.
[S18] Whoa
[S17] Well if you’re blind and you’re wrestling
[S20] [Inaudible]
[S20] Yeah ,but do you guys think a guy should be able to play field hockey?
[S18] Sure
[S17] Yeah
[S19] Yeah I guess /why not?
[S20] If you saw it what would you guys think?
[S18] Oh I’ve seen that issue of sports illustrates and the whole thing /is that what you’re talking about?
[S20] What? No, I don’t read.
[S18] No /a couple years back there was /I don’t read /[laughter] /I don’t read /um /uhh /that’s awful /I’m sorry /but there was  an issue of Sports Illustrated a while back that actually featured the same exact story /I thought that’s what you were referring to /it was like 
[S20] No
[S18] This was like when we were in middle school /it was like years ago /but um /yeah it was like /this guy’s wearing a skirt? /[laughter] /cause it was part of the uniform /like he wanted to play field hockey /ya know it was just like the girls
[S20] Probably called it a kilt.
[S18] Yes, yes /exactly /it was the whole thing /and he would /well like no /it’s like some skirt, right? /correct me if I’m wrong /for field hockey? /and so like at the /on the days of the match everyone wore their /uh /their skirts and this dude was walkin around with like a skirt
[S17] Did he wear it?
[S18] Yeah /as part of the team /so he’s wearing like this skirt around school /and I mean at first everyone /I bet ya he had to knock a couple heads in before they like let him wear it quietly /but
[S17] Did it slowly like subside?
[S18] Naw, man. The kid like persevered /that’s why it got into Sports Illustrated
[S17] But, I mean eventually did it?
[S18] Did he like break under the pressure? No
[S17] No, I mean did people start accepting him?
[S18] Yeah /yeah that was the point /like he just /he didn’t care and /like the voice in the crowd or whatever
[S20] That’s like what I was talking about earlier. Was he like good at the sport? 
[S18] I /ya know what? /I don’t even now /it was just that he wanted to play field hockey so bad
[S20] I didn’t even know they ever allowed guys to play field hockey
[S19] I think it’s weird that they allowed it. It’s like girls playing football.
[S18] It was the exception /yeah
[S20] How did they make the exception? Do you have any idea?
[S18] No
[S17] I think at my school it was like if your school doesn’t have a team for your gender /you can join the other team
[S20] Oh, wow.
[S18] Yeah, cause there was guys on the girls swimming team.
[S17] Cause you didn’t have a guys swim team?
[S18] Yeah
[S19] One year, girls joined our football team /but like our football coach was a huge jerk /so like there was no way they would ever get playing time /like and it’s weird cause they can’t go in the locker rooms during half time cause ya know
[S18] [Laughter] /Oh that’s a good point cause guys watch the girls change /gender stereotype right there /right there /male full frontal is an automatic NC-17 in a movie
[S20] Is it?
[S18] Yup.
[S20] That’s cause no one want to see it.
[S18] Yeah, it’s the ugly organ.
[Laughter]
But /um /no but like you can get brief full frontal
[S17] Remember like Titanic was like PG-13 
[S19] It should have been R [laughter]
[S18] Uh Airplane /Airplane /did anyone see Airplane with 
[S20] It was G or PG
[S18] Oh, it wasn’t G. I had to been at least PG. It was either PG or PG-13, but I’m pretty sure Airplane was PG-13.
[S20] It was not PG-13. It was either G or PG.
[S18] Yeah /Airplane with Leslie Neilson, right? /Isn’t that his name?
[S19] It couldn’t have been G. It musta been PG.
[S18] Yeah /not it couldn’t have been G /but anyways it wasn’t /it definitely wasn’t R and they have a scene parodying /like when the plane’s goin down and everyone’s running around /and they show a completely naked woman screaming, running across the /like /it’s a very funny scene 
[S20] It’s not the only time cause there’s a naked chick in like the x-rays too.
[S18] Yeah /and like /exactly /constantly
[S20] Not like I’m looking out for this.
[Laughter]
[S18] No /no like it’s a funny /yeah like things like that stick out because it’s nudity /but um yeah if you show like a naked guy running around it’d be like /ahh, oh my word
[S20] Snakes on a plane /when um the guy’s in the stall /and he’s doin his stuff and then the snake comes and /um gets him I guess
[Laughter]
Um /everybody was shocked /and that was R /and you saw
[S18] Did it show /was it brief?
[S20] You saw that much skin /I was like oh my God I saw his package /and like everybody was appalled /like that and there was a snake /ya know
[Laughter]
[S18] Oh wow
[S19] But, yeah. Two totally different things even though it’s just /ya know /the human body, but different genders /I don’t know
[So why do you guys think that is? Does anyone want to explain a little more?]
[S20] Um /just like /just art 
[Laughter]
No, no like in history
[S18] The woman’s body is a beautiful thing.
[S19] Even in history though women have been painted naked.
[S20] It is /it’s so much more beautiful than a guy’s body
[S19] Actually /I take that back /statues
[S18] Yeah /it’s like one of the most prominent 
[S20] Was that Donatello’s David?
[S18] Michelangelo’s 
[S20] Oh the –ello
[S18] Yeah, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles /but also it’s just like /there’s also the stereotype of guys being more perverted than girls
[S19] Yeah definitely. I think that’s true.
[S17] That could go along /there’s a lot more like female nudity and things like that available
[S20] Because it’s more accepted
[S18] I mean it isn’t even a problem in Europe.
[S20] Yeah, there’s naked people in Europe /in the ads and everything
[S18] Yeah, and it’s just like no big deal.
[S17] And like naked beaches and like people take their kids to it /and they’re cool with that.
[S20] It’s just part of their culture /it’s just 
[S18] But see like /what do you think like /I don’t know does that put us at a disadvantage as far as gender discrimination goes?
[S17] Cause we make a bigger deal out of it.
[S18] Well, that’s just nudity /that’s not even like gender discrimination
[S19] I don’t know how like gender discrimination works 
[S17] Well also like it makes you more aware of the differences /it could go either way
[S19] It’s ok for a woman to be portrayed as sexual objects, but if a man is /then 
[S20] What would you think? Like if you see a woman portrayed as that and then you see a man portrayed as that /as a sexual object like you just said /like what would you think?
[S19] It wouldn’t be as normal. Like you’re used to seeing a woman portrayed and selling sex and stuff like that 
[S20] Have you guys seen Beerfest?
[S19] Yeah
[S18] Yeah
[S20] Have you seen /um the Indian guy /um /that may have been the deleted scenes or whatever /but he was kinda like portrayed as the /he was a male prostitute and um 
[S19] Oh yeah
[Laughter]
[S18] Yeah
[S19] I do remember that.
[S20] It was weird.
[S19] It was weird.
[S20] Like /and that’s just society /um /like do you guys /I’m out of things /If women are nude, do you think guys should be as well?
[S19] I don’t think either should be.
[S17] But, to make it fair
[S19] To make it fair, they both should be
[S17] But, it’s not something we strive for /Ya know?
[Laughter]
[S18] I want to be portrayed as a sex symbol. I like when people look at me, Daddy.
[Laughter]
[S20] What?
[S18] I don’t know like /just like you get
[S20] I’m sitting here /I’m like I’m gonna hide
[S18] Like /I just may be a tard
[So do you think that men are ever discriminated against in the work place or in other ways?]
[S17] Like the male nurse, secretary type of thing.
[S18] Like Mr. Twenty over here and his poor pinched butt.
[S19] I think in that sense, men are but if it’s like a CEO position at a top country company /and a woman and a man are qualified for the same position /like who do you think is going to get the job?
[S17] The male because that’s more typically his role.
[S20] Yeah because they’re more /it’s been said the man is more intimidating and demanding /get the job done
[S18] Who do you think has a better shot?
[S20] At what?
[S18] Barrack Obama or Hilary Clinton?
[S19] Who’s the other one?
[S18] Hilary Clinton
[S19] Or who?
[S18] Obama
[S19] What?
[S20] The other guy /Obama
[S19] I don’t know who that is.
[S18] President elect /he’s half African American
[S19] I don’t watch the news.
[Laughter]
[S18] Oh, ok. So African American male or a white female?
[S19] That’s tricky.
[S20] That’s /that’s actually a really good topic /but he does rhyme with Osama though /so
[S17] I think white female. I think racial discrimination is more stronger
[S18] Do you think racial discrimination is more strong than gender?
[S17] Yeah, than gender.
[S19] Me too
[S20] But, I think with such powerful leaders such as Martin Luther King
[S18] He’s a man though.
[S19] Yeah and he’ll have like the whole black community behind him.
[S18] No, actually he doesn’t /not at all
[S19] Oh really?
[S18] Um /you should look into that /it’s a really big like 
[S19] Oh ok /then Hilary’s a shoe-in
[Laughter]
[S18] Yeah /but uh /yeah I mean like /I don’t know cause different countries in the world view it as like well they have a man and like it doesn’t matter /different countries in the world are like different races but like if a woman /the United States is run by a woman? /I mean like how would that look to other countries? /God, forbid /I mean like
[S19] Like women in top positions /like even in the Office /Jen /do you watch the office?
[S20] Isn’t she [inaudible]
[S19] What? She’s Michael’s boss/
[S20] Oh yeah /that’s right
[S19] Like /she gets not respect
[S20] She’s a bit intimidating though.
[S19] Yeah but like they /like they treat her as she’s
[S17] She’s really intimidating and she doesn’t get respect?
[S19] Like they don’t 
[S20] Well like /he’s like I’m gonna go have sex with Jen tonight /and like that’s what he always says and he always jokes about it /and um so there’s the whole sexual object thing brought up again /and then she’s just like /Michael, talk in the other room /it’s because they have like a brief sexual relationship
[S19] They made out in a hotel once.
[Laughter]
Like now into the third season they’ve established a relationship /but even now like none of like the people under her take her seriously /they don’t take their relationship seriously
[S18] I’ve never seen enough of the show to 
[S19] That’s a good show. You should probably watch it. But even like the way women are portrayed in that show /like one character
[S20] You have all the like different senses of like what women would be /like you have
[S19] You have the secretary
[S20] The secretary, Pam
[S19] Yeah /who her story line is based around Jim
[S20] Then you have the /um /obnoxious /um
[S19] Jim’s girlfriend
[S20] The obnoxious /the blonde /these people are 
[S19] You have the alcoholic and then you have the like homely looking one.
[S18] The homely looking one
[Laughter]
[S20] The one that looks like /kinda like a grandmother
[S19] Yeah
[S20] Yeah /glasses?
[S19] And she’s larger
[S18] Larger?
[S20] Fat
[S18] I love these /yeah
[S20] Naa /she’s not really 
[S18] P.C. word
[S19] Um /like you have your stereotypical women /and like all of their story lines are based around like relationships /like Angela is in a relationship with Dwight /Pam’s relationship with um Jim /um 
[S20] Jim’s tall and skinny?
[S19] The alcoholic doesn’t really have that big of a role /she just drinks sometimes /[laughter] /and then Phyllis has a relationship with this Bob Vance from Vance Refrigeration /[laughter]
[S18] Do you /do you think that actually has /says anything negative or positive or anything?
[S19] Oh I definitely think it says something. And Jen /it’s her relationship with Michael /I think it’s definitely negative because it’s like talking /basically their roles depend on men
[S20] And now it’s also making fun of it because it’s
[S18] And the /the one person who doesn’t have a man is an alcoholic
[S19] Is an alcoholic
[S18] OK
[S17] Ohh, yeah
[S18] That’s a good /even from what just you said /OK that makes a good point
[S19] Yeah
[S20] What’d I start to say? Maybe if someone tells me what I started to say /I just mumbled something /great show
[S19] Plug /watch the Office /8:30 Thursday nights /[laughter]
[S20] Damn. What was it?
[S18] What were you saying before? Who was saying stuff [inaudible]
[S19] Yeah /the stereotypes
[S18] Yeah, different stereotypes
[S17] Presidents
[S18] It’ll come
[S20] Now, if we look at the different /um / President elects I guess you could say /no /don’t look at their personalities /what did you guys say? /how did you feel as though /who would have a better shot? /you think the white female or the black male?
[S17] Oh, I said white female.
[S20] Like, without looking at the personalities
[S19] Well, Hilary’s more established. 
[S18] Without looking at their personalities
[S17] Without looking at the person
[S18] Just if someone said, hey black male or white chick?
[S19] I don’t know. I honestly don’t
[S17] It is a hard decision.
[S18] But, I think if you look from a /if people are looking from like a global standpoint /I think just a woman 
[S17] But, from Americans /I think racial issues are more of a problem than gender issues.
[S20] You want to expand on that?
[S17] I feel like people try not to be discriminatory against genders /it’s just like it’s been there for so long and its so deep-rooted but 
[S18] It also hasn’t been as extreme.
[S17] Yeah, racism has been
[S18] I mean we didn’t enslave any slave women.
[S17] Yeah /but people who have /people who are more racists are very racist, and they have very strong opinions /and I don’t think there’s a lot of people 
[S20] That still does go on today.
