GROUP1234
GAY MARRIAGE
[While some say to legalize gay marriage, others are still opposed to it. Do you think either side is right or wrong, and why?]
[S4] I think it should absolutely be legalized because I mean studies have shown that it’s /you know /it’s they haven’t proven /but it strongly suggests that it’s genetic /so why would you deny someone a civil right just based on genetics? That seems barbaric almost.
[S2] I think as long as it is not a choice, then it should be legalized. Cause I mean, how can you discriminate against someone /it’s just like race /I mean you have no choice in that /just like gender discussions, you know? Cause if its not your fault /you can’t discriminate against someone for that
[S3] I don’t even know if I /I mean I agree with you, but then even as far as if it is your choice what is
[S1] I still think legalize it
[S3] What’s the difference? How’s it hurting the government if it’s just a choice? If you’re living a /ok if you have two men who live very, very comparable lives /um /you know both very good people /both have their jobs /both you know /one’s gay by choice and one’s just /you know straight /what’s the difference /how’s this guy hurting /why should he not have the right to spend his life legally with someone else?
[S2] Well for one, I think /um /two men or two women raising a child /um /the child missed the other portion /like I think like a man and woman balance it out sort of like how we were talking about in the gender conversation /um /that’s for one and also one thing I was just thinking of like randomly /wondering either the [inaudible] or something /um /if you say that /if being gay was shown to be like a choice or whatever /like a complete choice /and then you say it’s ok /like you have to say it’s ok for everyone /but then like if everyone was gay then this whole thing of like population /like we wouldn’t be populating the world /I mean I thought of that like once /I don’t know
[S1] But, again though if /I mean along the same lines as people not smoking if marijuana was legal like legalize gay marriage /I’m not gonna like girls /it’s not gonna all of a sudden change me to oh now that like it’s ok to get married I’m not /even if it is a choice /I don’t think anything /I don’t think legalizing gay marriage would make anyone’s choice different
[S2] Well, if it’s a choice though /then that’s something that you can change like you might get up to a point in your life where you change that choice /you know?
[S1] No, I agree with that, but I feel like as much as /I don’t feel it’s ever going to be a hundred percent choice. I don’t think they’ll ever find that out. I don’t know, and I mean I really don’t know /but they have come so close to finding that it is something genetic /and just I mean even /I just /I don’t know /I think that even if it was a choice, that they should be able to
[S3] Well, if it’s a choice /I don’t understand why /I don’t even know what /what choice? /I mean it’s like ok I do like girls but I have to choose /I want to choose to be gay /it doesn’t make sense
[S4] And why would someone want to put up with all the crap gay people have to put up with?
[Laughter]
[S2] Exactly, yeah /why would someone choose a life of discrimination /that’s like amazing
[S1] I mean I’m not thinking like it’s a choice /to be completely honest /but again /I didn’t even study it, but I’m kinda not thinking it could be a choice /maybe its partly choice /but again /I mean its not like you wake up one day /you’re like, yup same sex today /it’s not a choice like that /you’re attracted to one or the other or sometimes both /but one or the other /you’re attracted to male or female
[S2] I could see like a teenager though just being confused /either just like being introduced to like their sexuality /you know /and all that /or just to like rebel /like just like break the norm and try like
[S3] They can’t get married anyways /you have to have your parents consent, don’t you? /if you’re under like 16 or 17
[S1] I think it should be the same / its actually /yeah /I think 18 is the legal age, but again
[S2] But, I’m saying though /instances where it could be a choice
[S3] I don’t think that’s ever gonna be an issue /I really don’t /I mean would you /uh /naturally in you know the normal state /a woman is attracted to a man and a man is attracted to a woman /you’re not gonna /I think it’s very /in a confused, young state where you’re just getting used to your sexuality /and even if you just get into that in your twenties /doesn’t mean your necessarily going to get into a marriage based on that choice /you know putting aside like /I can’t imagine myself ever being with a woman /you know what I mean? /I wouldn’t be choice or even knowing I have that choice /not gonna be my choice /so I don’t think that it would change that much /Do you know what I mean?
[S2] Yeah
[S1] And, also with like the marriage /I mean I understand there’s also like a legal side to marriage where it turns /its like a union and you’re together and you have all the rights of the same /you know give them all the rights you want /which I feel like the only restriction should be /the same way it is with heterosexual couples /you need to be 18 or have permission /but you need to be 18 to get married. Why is it any different? Why are there all these other stipulations? I mean really what a wedding /I mean besides the legal like I said /you stand up in front of everyone you know and you say I love you and they say I love you back and you have a party /you know what I mean? /and really, like what is so wrong that we have to tell them they’re not allowed to have that? That’s why when there’s like commitment ceremonies, and things like that and they do /they do the ceremony part without the whole legal /they know they’re not legally bound to each other, but you got the ring and you stand up in front of everyone and you say you love each other /like what’s so wrong that homosexual people can’t do that too?
[S2] Do you guys feel /um /that having them have like a marriage except calling it something different would be enough?
[S3] No, I think that’s a slap in face.
[S1] No, I think it’s like it’s still like saying, well I’m gonna get married, but you’re not good enough to /and it’s not like a question of good people or bad people /you know it’s not like /it doesn’t make them bad people /it doesn’t make them bad eggs /and especially if they find out its not even a choice they have /you know like /and it’s the same kind of thing /like oh you have brown hair, you’re not allowed to get married, sorry /you know like one of those /it’s the same kind of thing /it’s a genetic /it’s a genetic thing
[S2] It seems like it shouldn’t be the government’s place to decide whether this is right or wrong cause
[S3] I think it’s much more a moral issue.
[S2] Yeah
[S3] I mean, it’s more of a /you know /religious based issue. I was thinking about this when we were /when I was having my chat /it’s much more of a moral issue and why /if this is a country that’s free to have every religion /why not gay marriage/ it doesn’t make sense to me
[S4] I think that the churches had such an influence on people /still influences people /and they call it a sin /so you know /their following is kinda like oh I don’t want to go against the church
[S1] And now, I know that even /like legalizing gay marriage obviously wouldn’t necessarily mean they would get married in the Catholic Church /ya know /I mean like /ya know /but so it’s the kind of thing that’s like what about letting gay people get married /it doesn’t really affect like /I’m not affected by gay people getting married /like it doesn’t change anything for anyone else /its allowing two people who love each other to be united
[S4] And they’re gonna live with each other whether or not
[S1] And that’s what I’m saying, you tell them they’re not allowed to get married /there are gay couples all over the country who live together, who adopt children and only they’re not /only one name is on it /and that’s like another slap in the face too /is that this is your child and you both are the parents of it, but actually only one of you is legally responsible for this child /and then in other cases of um gay couples /there was a case when /I forget exactly what it was, but whereas one person /one of the /I think it was two men and one of the men was in critical condition and his partner had no say over what was gonna happen to him, or what was going to /you know I think he was on life support, and he had no say in anything that was going on because he was just /for all they knew he was just a friend and like your friends don’t have any say in that /so his parents were the ones making the decision, but the guy kept saying like I know what he wants and we’ve been together how long and /he doesn’t have the rights to then do that when he’s probably the one who knows him the closest just because they didn’t stand up and say I love you in front if people
[S3] Right /it doesn’t make sense that you have to go through a lot of money things /you can’t keep your money together
[S1] Oh yeah. You can’t do any sort of things /in a lot of cases you can’t /and even in the case of adopting a child just as where you are a heterosexual couple /I mean father and mother both sign /you know /and alright well two adopt a child, but when you’re a homosexual couple then only one person is responsible for the child /you’re just another person /you know when /you’re not even /no one even looks at you as a parent of the child /you’re just another person in this child’s life /you have no say over it
[S3] And off of /um /what /what you said about the stability of a mother and father /um / well me personal views on that is /you know /I’m going to have a husband and I believe that a family for me would be a husband and a wife /I baby-sit for a lesbian couple when I was a child /in my community home I know there’s two males who have three children they’re raising /and the children /just wonderful /I mean really good kids /like all of them /not that you know /they’re just normal kids /they don’t seem to have any problems /you know /and I think in a place where we have children who grow up /in you know /their parents beat them or their parents are alcoholics /that’s a lot more /you know why are they allowed to have their kids and not 
[S2] Well, yeah /I mean its’ definitely possible.
[S3] But, I think it’s just as loving with two fathers or two mothers as it would be with a father and a mother. It’s different, granted /but there’s so many other things in this society that are different
[S1] And it’s even now more accepted too where they’re /one thing wasn’t it would be weird /if you were like so draw a picture of your family and there were two family it was like ooo /but then it like starts to become /I mean it’s so prevalent now that even though it’s not legal /I mean I have lots of friends who are gay, and I know lots of people /even older people who are gay and/or lesbian /like whatever /and I /it’s really becoming so prevalent and so much a part of it that like I just really don’t see a single reason why they should not be married
[S4] Yeah, just look back like thirty years ago and nobody
[S1] I mean when it was so hidden, and you weren’t allowed to say you were gay. I mean you were allowed, but no one did because they were afraid of what would happen to them /and even now /I mean now we were talking about gender discrimination /things like that /I mean gay pride parades everywhere with millions of people, you know? /and all those kinds of things /it’s just so much more of an open society now, that I feel like this would be a perfect time to maybe give them gay marriage /I don’t see /and then again I [inaudible] /but I just /I don’t see /it’s not affecting me at all /in like why /how does it affect heterosexual people if homosexual people are allowed to get married?
[S4] I think some people are afraid that like a gay couple that has children /they’ll raise them to be gay, but if it’s a genetic thing /then that’s not gonna happen
[S1] Yeah, if it’s a genetic thing then that goes along with genetics /like they’d have to /I mean they’d have to figure it all out if like /you know /and I mean also not to be /but I mean it’s not even a trait that could be like carried on through reproduction because you know what I mean /like you’re adopting kids anyway
[Laughter]
And like it’s not /like it’s not something that’s gonna then be like reproducing
[S3] There’s artificial insemination.
[S1] Yes, but then they have to figure out exactly how it was 
[S3] Well, what about people /for example, my sister’s roommate freshman year /um /her mother and father split up because the Dad was gay and it was discovered when she was like six and he finally said I’m gay, I’ve been lying, you know this is what’s going on /he remarried /has you know /him and his partner adopted a child /they mother remarried /so she has quite a family or you know situation /she wasn’t /she’s not gay /she didn’t get the gene /you know so /not necessarily /it can’t be reproduced /it’s not like it’s gonna skip a generation /she’s gonna have a son. And he’s definitely gonna be gay /you know what I mean? /like
[S1] Yeah, and if they definitely decided it was genetic /they would have to figure out how exactly /I mean I guess if that was the concern
[S4] Yeah, they’re not even sure about that yet so
[S3] But, it’s not like it’s a disease.
[S1] No, no, it’s not like you’re going to get a blood disorder that is like carried through generations /it’s like
[S2] What if it was /uh /shown to actually be something that they could fix, and I put quotation marks for the reporter. 
[S3] I don’t know. Is that a right? Is that something that we’re supposed to be moving towards? You know, is that why it’s a genetic thing? I don’t know.
[S2] What if 
[S1] Or maybe you’d have to learn 
[S2] Well, it’s just like the whole marijuana, cigarette thing /I mean marijuana’s bad for you /its just more natural /I mean it /typically you go towards things that are more natural /I don’t know like in general /you know
[S1] But, also, what you have to remember to is that like people only have been coming out publicly for not so many years /like we’ve already been saying that maybe this girl’s father was kind of pushed into a marriage because he felt like he couldn’t be gay at the time /so I mean I /there are definitely /this is not something that just happened /all of a sudden people just weren’t gay in 1970 /you know /like so yeah I mean in the year 
[S3] It’s been happening for centuries.
[S1] In the year hundred there were definitely gay people /you know /especially if it turns out to be genetic /there has to be /and if we can go through /I mean it’s the year 2007 /not eight /but it’s the year 2007 and like we’ve gone all this time and /I don’t know I feel like it’s just more accepted now so people are worried about it becoming something like that and more prevalent /and are we going towards something like that /but, it’s been going on forever /or at least I believe that
[S4] And it probably will go on forever.
[S1] Yeah
[S2] I feel like /um/ being gay definitely could be a combination of like nature /but also nurture like as well /so like I mean I don’t know what kind of implications that would have /like I know you said before /um /or we were talking about this for a while /how um /the government is worried about people raising someone gay /so I don’t know /I mean if that came out what that would mean
[S1] I think it goes along with the same /I don’t know if it would work the same with other qualities like just because I mean obviously as children of our parents we are a certain part of both of them, but just because one of our parents has a certain quality /doesn’t mean that we take it that way /and I believe a lot of it is nurture and that kind of thing /but I don’t know if it’s possible to raise your child gay /like I don’t /I don’t know if that /and I really don’t know which is why I can’t really even answer your question
[S2] Well, I know a lot of times they say they can tell like /you can tell like just from a child /like /like early on /like they’ll just have certain signs, and you know when they get older they’re gonna be gay
[S1] Yeah, which is another reason why a lot of people do think it’s genetic because even early on /before you even know what sexuality is and before you even know anything /they see these kind of qualities and then find out that this child does end up being gay /so it’s another reason why like you kind of have to wonder is it something that these /and I don’t want to say like these people because it’s not /but you know whatever /it’s something that homosexual people can’t even prevent
[S3] Yeah, one of my best friends at home turned out to be gay and I felt as if I was waiting for years for him to just /it comes a time
[S1] A lot of times you know /you’re just like, ooo is he gay yet?
[S3] He always wanted to /I mean as a child he was just very interested /we met when I was four years old /very interested in playing with my dolls and you know did dress up with me /I mean honestly that was a true situation /we /he would play princess with me and you know what I mean /and all these different things /and my mom you know /discussed it before he even came out  /you know /she was like well he did /and she said all these things /and I was like you’re right /he had to come over for all these things /and we played tea parties and stuff /it kinda made sense, and I know for a fact that his father didn’t teach him that /you know to be gay or whatever /and his Mom didn’t
[S1] Yeah, no one handed him Barbies, and was like you are playing with these.
[S2] But, I’m sure if like they’d you know given him all these big trucks and G.I. Joe’s /he probably woulda turned out the same
[S3] Yeah, I mean at home his dad was always like 
[S2] Giving him trucks and G.I. Joe’s
[S3] Yeah, I mean it wasn’t like /you know /he always seemed more interested /almost to the point where he was more interested than you know /like really we can’t play soccer today?
[S1] [Laughter] /really we’re dressing up again?
[Laughter]
[S3] Yeah /you know it’s
[S1] It’s the kind of thing too when not even /along terms of gay marriage, but if it does turn out to be something that they find to be genetic /there are um /I have a friend who came out and said he was gay /and his parents put him into counseling to try and talk him out of it /and uh /talk about not accepting your kids /but decided /they decided that this was something he could work his way out of
[S3] Overcome
[S1] Right, overcome the gayness.
[S2] Well, like I said before /like for a teenager I could see them either getting confused or something.
[S1] Yes, and that I understand, but I definitely /like of all the people I know
[S2] I’m saying /like you have to make that clarification /like
[S1] Yes, which I understand that, but maybe if they found that it was a genetic thing we wouldn’t have /I mean there are so many people who I’m gonna use the word hate /and it’s a bad word /but like hate gay people /and it’s /not to say there wouldn’t be discrimination if it did turn out to be genetic because there’s discrimination against a lot of things that are genetic things in our society
[S4] There’s overweight people.
[S1] And there’s always gonna be people who /but maybe it would somehow lessen the discrimination /because there really is just /I don’t know
[S3] But, I think maybe that’s a factor in why they’re not legalizing it. They’re just keeping people comfortable with their insecurities about /you know/and there’s very many people who are just uncomfortable about gay you
[S1] And especially in prior generations too /like along the lines of like our grandparent’s age /there’s a lot of /just because in their /when they were growing up it was not /that was when you /no one was and there were people who were, but you didn’t know
[S3] And in my Understanding Lit. class we just read the screenplay for American Beauty /and um I don’t know if anyone has seen the movie, but this /the father has a son who is just /he has neighbors who are gay and he’s keeps /excuse me for saying this /these fags /and he keeps really just letting /and they parade around here like it’s their right to do so and he’s just very, very /um /hateful and in the end we find out that he was homosexual /um /you know he felt that way
[S2] It was a defense mechanism.
[S3] What he /he never act /he didn’t think that he was supposed to act on it so that’s when he got his son and he /you better not act like a faggot /excuse me again /um /but he says these things /these hateful things /and really it’s just his own hatred for the way he turned out or was born or whatever reason
[S1] Right, however it works out.
[S3] Um / played out in other people /so I think that happens a lot
[S1] And there’s another evidence for it being genetic because a lot of times /even in the case of people /um / like your sister’s roommate’s parents who /and I obviously don’t know specifically /but who feel like husband, wife, having kids /is the way it’s supposed to be /so they almost fight it /fight their feelings and /whereas not necessarily hiding it because it’s legal /cause like we said it’s not legal and there are people everywhere fighting these feelings /but, you kinda feel like that’s the way it’s supposed to be /the natural way /you know quote, end quote /but, what’s the way to say there can’t be two different ways /[laughter] /you know /why /I don’t 
[S4] People should just accept the fact that people are different.
[S1] Right, and obviously we’re never gonna get the entire population to accept it, but you can’t get anyone to accept everything. There’s nothing that’s one hundred percent accepted, nothing. Someone has a problem with everything. 
[S2] I mean, I can see people like /like being uncomfortable /like /and I would say that’s ok as long as like /as long as you don’t discriminate against someone or make them feel
[S1] Yeah, you can’t tell people what they’re comfortable with /you know /I mean, I guess
[S2] Yeah
[S1] We shouldn’t necessarily be hating on them or discriminating them because
[S2] But, I mean even you guys like /you said um /you could never picture yourself like /like being with a woman /I mean I could understand how people could be like uncomfortable /like don’t want to like /you know see like /gay people you know 
[S1] Yeah
[S3] It’s your natural reaction.
[S1] And, that’s definitely understood, and that’s fine /but I don’t know if necessarily that means that the people who want to practice that way should not be able to 
[S3] And I think that even there’s many gay people who understand /you know /the don’t push it in people’s face /you know /they don’t say /you know /this is /you know /they don’t push it in your face /they don’t
[S1] Right
[S3] Call them their lovers /they’re /this is a partner that we live with
[S2] Even like a regular couple doesn’t
[S1] And I mean /it’s one of my /one of my friends went away to school and her roommate has a girlfriend /which again /two girls you know /and um /it was the kind of thing where she said in the very beginning /she’s like it’s not that you have a girlfriend /it’s that I don’t want to watch people make out every night /you know that kind of thing /she’s like doesn’t matter if you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend /I mean that’s not everyone’s view, but she has like a liberal view on it /she’s like honestly I just don’t want anything pushed in my face /I don’t care if it’s a girlfriend or a boyfriend /I don’t really need you to
[S3] I’m not that touchy-feely.
[S1] Right, I’m not really into having not /like having to be uncomfortable in my own room because your girlfriend’s here /and so it’s that kind of thing where it /and I understand that some people are uncomfortable with the fact that it is the same sex /but it goes for the same way /you don’t really want to watch anyone /really /like you know /so
[S2] Yeah
[S3] Nobody likes that 
[S1] Nobody likes that couple that you go out with and you’re like, yup they’re together /[laughter] /you could always tell
[S3] Yeah /um / I think also this /um /non-acceptance by our government leads to /I mean there’s people who commit suicide over this /because they feel unaccepted /you know my friend that I was talking about with the doll that was younger had depression and /you know /felt like he let his family down /you know his father went through so many hard times because of it when in reality if it was just an accepted thing /it’s not his choice so I mean if he thought he was allowed to do it, maybe he wouldn’t have gone through all that terrible stuff /if you know or people that
[S1] Oh yeah, and even like I said /like the friend that I have that /who’s parents forced him into therapy /like that kind of thing /that takes a toll on you /when you come out your parents /you’re like, listen you’re the two people that should understand me /this is what I’m going through /this is what I’m dealing with /and they’re like, oh no you’re not /like how do you even /if you can’t feel comfortable like in your own family /how are you gonna feel comfortable anywhere else? /and then right on top of it /I mean I’m sure there will still be parents who do the same /who try and do the same kind of things /but, if it’s legal and you’re gonna be able to practice what you want
[S2] Um /something I just thought of /remember when we talked about gender discrimination? /we said the government might not want to make it legal because it would show weakness to other countries /um /because they might not respect /you know /women /like especially like the Middle East /do you think there could be that side of it for this issue also? /I mean I don’t know like foreign stances on gay marriage really
[S4] I don’t think it would be as big an issue of having a woman president because /because it’s like normal citizens don’t have like power positions
[S1] Like publicized, you know?
[S2] It’s not like a gay couple’s going to be the president together /or you know what I mean? /it’s like /they already /other countries are already well aware of the upri- /I mean watch any of our TV sitcoms
[S1] I mean there’s no /I mean Will and Grace /you know what I mean? /I mean /and really I don’t think they’re /I mean I’m sure if we really tried to think about it we could think of a million shows and movies and everything that you know that has that /and even just when you just think about /I mean I don’t know obviously personally /but just thinking of all the people I know who are homosexual /and the people that my friends know are /you know /it’s kind of almost just so prevalent in our society that you kind of /couldn’t even /not that we’d want to hide from it /but, you couldn’t even if you wanted to /you can’t get away from how prevalent it is in pop culture /you can’t get away from how prevalent it is in just everyday life
[S3] I just think /I just think it’s a complete disrespectful gesture from our country that allows so many things and so many rights /you know to some extent /to not allow these people to do the things that we do /you know get in front of /obviously it means something to get in front of the people you love and you know say I love this person /and your I do’s /whatever /so why should we say that that group of people doesn’t have that same right /just seems absurd to me
[S1] Right, and again /they’re not forcing people to say now you have to marry someone of your same sex /it’s not anything like that /just want to be able to practice the same things that all heterosexual couples can practice /and have the same rights which again that goes back to how we were talking about /um /adopting a child and rights when if someone is in critical condition /so you know or anything like that /you want to be able to be like yes that is my wife or my husband /you know whatever you want to be able to have the same role that a heterosexual couple does /you know your spouse has like a huge role in your life /even legal responsibilities and those kinds of things /and then to not give them those rights just because you’re of the same sex /I don’t think like it’s fair
[S4] I’m trying to think /um 
[S2] It’d be /it’s kind of almost outrageous to think that it’s not legal /I mean if they prove for sure that it’s not a choice /then I mean how could the government discriminate /I mean how could they justify
[S1] That would be really what would /I think that would be really what would make it
[S2] Make some changes happen
[S1] I think that’s the only thing that could be holding them back /is that it’s not something that can’t be avoided /that you want to /and not that /and there are a lot of people that are gay /and I’m not gonna say all because I have not spoken to every single one, but there are a lot of people /um /who would not say that they had a choice or not /or have something where they /I mean obviously you’re attracted to certain people /you know you’re attracted to certain people /if you’re attracted to someone of the same sex /like how much do you control do you really have over it? Think of in heterosexual couples, when you’re attracted to someone /like there’s not much you can do about that
[S4] Hmm. That’s true. Do you ever /do you think they’ll ever find the gay gene? Isolate it and prove that it’s genetic?
[S2] What have they proved so far? Do you guys know?
[S1] I don’t know specifically, I just know that there’s been
[S2] Research about it?
[S1] Yes
[S3] Um / another thing is that maybe there’s been not threats, but promises from the church /and you know not such good /um you know they’re not gonna be like we’re gonna stand behind you /you know the United States government, if they legalize it /which could be a big issue cause I think that /that might out the church and government at odds /you know they might say this is one of the largest issues in our church right now and you’re gonna go ahead and legalize it? So that might be something keeping
[S2] Yeah that’s true.
[S1] Separation of church and state
[S3] Yeah
[S4] I think that’s an issue the church has to modernize on.
