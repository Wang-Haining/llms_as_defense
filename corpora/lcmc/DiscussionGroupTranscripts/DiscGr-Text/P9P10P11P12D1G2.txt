GROUP 9101112
GAY MARRIAGE
[Alright, is everyone ready to begin? While some states have legalized gay marriage others are still opposed to it. Do you think either side is right or wrong, and why? I think I’m gonna start with you this time.]
[Laughter]
[S12] Um /personally, I would be for it /um /a friend of mine /actually, a few friends of mine are gay /and based on that /I used to disagree, but /um /I would say that /yeah um /it’s /if they can be happy then it seems like a good thing.
[S9] Wait /so your friends changed your mind about it? 
[S12] Yes. I didn’t really have any experience or any real knowledge of um /like a gay presence /like I thought they were very, very, very small minority /um/ and initially thought that they shouldn’t /uh /be able to get married or have unions or what not /but, over time I realized that it /that just didn’t make sense
[S11] I think when it comes to like a legal union /absolutely /um /when it comes to being able to get a spouse’s pension /being able to get healthcare /den-, dent- , dentistry /ah /sorry /dental care /etcetera /and when it comes to tax issues /absolutely, there’s no reason that they shouldn’t be able to /and, when it comes to religious that’s a different thing completely, and I don’t think it should be brought in although I know it is a lot, especially in our country which is so heavily Christian /which /you know separation of church and state /please /um
[S9] Well, I mean separation of church and state isn’t actually in the Constitution.
[S11] Yes, unfortunately, idealistically /idealistically /the religion has nothing to do with it /this is /I mean at a lot of /and I know I’ve heard arguments for it that are /that say, oh you know they’re more frivolous and their unions are shorter and /fifty percent of all marriages end in divorce nowadays so really /not a valid argument
[S9] Exactly, it wouldn’t seem to harm the state to [inaudible]
[S10] What’s missing is every time it happens, they’re all on the daily news /you know it’s like /it’s like um / the third or fourth story you hear about in your local news everyday /you got the St. Mary’s or the not St. Mary’s /it wouldn’t be at St. Mary’s, but whatever 
[S11] At city hall
[S10] Yeah
[S11] Did anyone hear about a meeting at Washington state /they wanted to pass /they um / the government in the state was saying that the reason that they didn’t want gay marriage was because they couldn’t have children or they had no intent to have children without artificial insemination /so the um GLBT community in the area /uh /wrote up a bill saying, OK if the heterosexual couple is planning not to have children or cannot have children /they can’t get married either /which, honestly /they did it to make a point /they didn’t do it to get the law passed, but it makes so much sense 
[S9] Yeah
[S11] Cause these arguments that are made against gay marriage
[S10] Yeah, it seems like there isn’t actually a valid argument against it.
[S11] There isn’t. 
[S9] I can’t believe they did that. So wait, what was your reaction to that?
[S11] My reaction to that? Or just in general?
[S9] No /they reacted /they what /they petitioned or?
[S11] They didn’t petition, they /they just kinda wrote it up and spread it around /it never actually went through /they were trying to make a point
[S10] I was gonna say I still think it’s very generational /we’re at a time right now where people already are becoming more accepting /it’s already more of the culture like you said /like you have two friends that are probably around the same age as you maybe, but they’re out per say /like you know they’re gay /whereas like /it was a type of situation where the generation before us /if those same kids would have come out their parents would have kicked them out of the house /they would become pariahs not only with their family but with the community /now it’s like you go /there’s certain cities /certain cultures /where you can go to and be accepted, thus making it more a part of our country in general /like being gay is not like /it’s not being necessarily a minority /you’re just part of whatever you are, and you have a different sexual preference /it’s more accepted, it’s not close
[S11] Yeah, I was just gonna say
[S10] It’s still not perfect.
[S11] I mean look at /um /what his name? /from uh 
[S12] Matthew Shepherd? 
[S11] No, not Matthew Shepherd
[S12] Middle America example for you
[S11] Yeah, well, exactly /the priest who’s been going around saying that all the deaths in the Iraq war are because America accepts homosexuals
[S9] Really?
[S11] Same guy who /you saw the play /uh Laramie Project, right? The signs /you know who I’m talking about?
[S12] That’s the priest?
[S11] That’s the priest, it’s an actual man um /I can’t remember his name /I just read it like three hours ago /uh /I can’t remember his name, but um /but cause people /that’s actually a big mentality in our country though /it doesn’t seem like it because we are in this urban environment /and we are /especially in our school /there’s a huge if not gay, lesbian population /it’s very accepting here
[S10] Anybody lives in the northeastern /pretty close to it
[S11] Or from L.A.
[S10] You’re from L.A.?
[S11] I’m not, two of my gay friends are. But, you’re either from the coast, you’re not really from 
[S9] The Midwest /it’s not like it’s the first time that states have /you know /made laws that they ban certain types of marriages, you know I can /I just wonder if it’s not just you know twenty first century version of /you know, banning interracial marriages /and even that you know /there is still plenty of racism in this country
[S11] Oh, absolutely.
[S9] And, and so 
[S11] It just changes from year to year /which it is
[S9] Yeah, and so I mean I agree with you /you said you know you think there’s still a lot of people in this country who really are not OK with it, and criticize it, and things like that, but I /um /in terms of /I guess /civil unions versus marriage /I /I think they should be able to get married /I don’t know /what is it, Vermont is civil union and New Jersey is civil union
[S12] Isn’t Massachusetts?
[S9] Massachusetts is actual marriage I think.
[S11] Either /although technically /I mean /then we have the things called common law marriage /should that be applied? Because technically, if a woman and a man live in a house for I think seven years /federally, they’re married /common law marriage is still in effect /it’s a law that’s still on the books
[S10] I didn’t know that.
[S11] I think it’s seven years, it may be more /I could be wrong, but I know that if you live in the same house and you’re not related /you’re technically married, and if you split off /you separate the assets
[S10] Like Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins?
[S11] I don’t even /honestly who’s Tim Robbins?
[S10] I was just giving you an example 
[Laughter]
[S11] Unless it’s the speaker 
[S10] You don’t know who Tim Robbins is? Tim Robbins is the guy from Shawshank Redemption /been in a lot of other movies
[S11] I honestly don’t. This is gonna sound really bad /I don’t watch a lot of movies from this decade /I watch old movies, so uh /like Humphrey Bogart, Carey Grant /I’m great /but, I have no idea who that is /um but, it’s a common law marriage so /would that apply /like would it apply? Because then /I mean obviously if it’s homosexual people who are just living together /um would it apply /would common law marriage /things like that /apply? 
[S12] Well first, in terms of policy and the definition, you’d have to go with the homosexual union or what not to be included in the
[S11] Well, obviously. But, I’m saying, what so you guys think? Like if you think, it works /if they’d have to like /do you get what I’m saying /am I making sense?
[S9] Yeah
[S10] No, I [inaudible] /absolutely /I just really don’t like the topic in general because I think it’s just like /it’s like blatant /like bigotry or whatever you want to call it /like it’s in front of people’s eyes but everyone has opinions about it /like if everybody was /was completely um respectful of everybody else’s personal preferences of sexuality and what not /then there would be no question about it
[S11] So when does that happen? When does that happen when everybody agrees?
[S10] So, it’s blatant discrimination, but people are cool with it. Most of our country is cool with it apparently. 
[S11] It’s blatant discrimination with a lot of things /I mean there’s still blatant discrimination with /my father’s from Germany, right? There’s still blatant discrimination against him, we’ve gone into restaurants and people have /wouldn’t have talked to him because he’s German /we’ve gone to like Gold’s Deli /I don’t know if any of you /my Dad has a very thick German accent, so he’s gotten /it’s everywhere /it just doesn’t /it just depends on who the person 
[S12] I guess that’s what makes being gay so different though, is like you have to be told /you can’t just /hey, you’re talking 
[S9] My aunt married /um / a black man /and my grandparents after /uh /my grandfather retired /they used to live in New York /uh / they moved to North Carolina /and to a very rural area /then my aunt /her family won’t go down there cause there’s /you know racism still exists and
[S11] I know. Most people who think they’re thinking are really just rearranging their prejudices /so
[S10] Oh /um /to some people it’s not so clear cut /um /well, that’s part of the controversy /um /at least one of the things that’s been brought up /some cite it as a disease or sickness in the sense that it’s a result of a biochemical imbalance in the brain and there’s some places /some churches that offer therapy to correct /um
[S12] Oh yeah, you have your own sect of house moms that have kids they think might be gay that they take to church to have priests and so forth try to fix em.
[S11] Well, there’s also the whole thing that if /they’ve now found that /what they think is the gay gene /do you guys know /I didn’t get to it /I had class, but I’ve read his rating before. The whole problem with that is every single church in existence is going to have to completely rewrite what they’re saying /I mean how /cause technically /alright, speaking Catholic, ok? 
[S12] Churches won’t look at that.
[S11] Yes /oh wanna bet?
[S12] Well, ok then /there’s the whole evolution thing too that would be a little more important to buy us some
[S11] Well cause there’s still /there’s still /I don’t know /when it comes to religion / cause this is one of the cardinal sins /you know? /homosexuality is one of the huge sins /but technically /everyone’s born with original sin, right? /so, and they’re baptized, they get forgiven /this is from the Catholic point of view
[S12] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[S11] I’m not Catholic, but /Catholic high school, Catholic junior high, Catholic college /it’s kind of gotten in my head
[Laughter]
[S11] Um / so /would it be forgiven already? /if you’re Catholic and you’ve been baptized?
[S9] Homosexuality?
[S11] Cause you’re born /if, if it’s genetic, and you’re born with it /how can you have a genetic predisposition to a sin /that somebody else doesn’t have /they’re gonna have to completely rethink things, and when it comes to evolution it’s a little different I think /it’s a different kind of thing
[S12] Well, I mean /but, it’s all in the same science
[S11] Mmmm /I think this is more about the people in the church
[S12] I’ve never even heard that argument before /the whole original sin /baptism 
[S11] Oh, no, that’s what baptism is /you can get rid of original sin
[S12] No, I know what that is. I’m just saying in terms of /does that mean they’re already forgiven? / in terms of /I never really looked at it in terms of homosexuality I suppose, but I mean /it makes sense /I suppose /you could tie it together
[S9] I mean, I don’t know if the church’s policy has turned out all that well /I mean can’t help but think that the repression of homosexuality had something to do with you know /the priests
[S11] Oh, it also /the Catholic Church opposed the fork /so
[S10] What?
[Laughter]
[S11] Yeah, they opposed utensils. 
[S12] It was a long time ago.
[S11] It was a very long time ago, but still /ok /this is /they change /that’s what I’m saying /things can change /they do change /look at Vatican two /look at what you know /some sects actually won’t admit that it happened, but that’s a different thing all together /the Catholic Church is so interesting
[S10] Well, another part of /um / the controversy /is that some /I can’t speak to the validity of it, but /um /some people would cite environmental factors in terms of /like determining whether someone is actually gay or just confused /um /so there’s that whole issue /and it’s also /what I’ve heard anyway, and part of the argument against homosexuals being able to adopt /um /is that it might /um /pervert the child’s world view, whereas I think it would rather lend them a more open mind
[S9] I mean, you /I mean kids are brought up by so many different kinds of families /now /I mean by grandparents, single parents, or aunts, uncles /whatever /I mean at least /and many kids grow up without a loving family or a good home or anything like that /so /I don’t know why not /you know /then
[S11] There’s also the argument that /who says that kids are being perverted by parents who are close-minded and racist and /you know /any other number of things /who’s to say 
[S9] At least there’s full proof for that.
[S11] Yeah, exactly /and who’s to say it’s a perversion? /who’s to say it’s just not natural? /you are /yes /it’s nature and nurture /it’s not one or the other /it’s both /it’s not white, it’s not black, it’s gray /that’s another situation where there is no black and white
[S10] Another thing that /well /that I read about /I can’t remember where /um / that’s not good /um 
[S11] It happens, it happens
[S10] But, with regard to /um / genetic planning or family planning /um /like say /uh / handicapped people /there’s a debate over this /um /have the option to have a child that is handicapped /um they can go in and actually do that /like a deaf couple actually wants a deaf child that would have otherwise been normal /there’s been debate though /I think it’s speculative at this point /um /concerning whether or not a gay couple could /if they chose artificial insemination or something like that /could do that /assuming they could isolate a gene for that 
[S11] To be honest, I don’t think people would because just because of the way it’s looked at in our society /just the stigma that comes with it which is /I’m not saying it’s right, but 
[S9] I don’t think that’s right to begin with.
[S11] I don’t think genetic altering in /in /ugh / just mmm / totally different situation /just totally different /mmm
[S12] Could you make a kid left-handed per say /if you wanted to have like a better athlete /just throwing this out there
[S10] Uh /I don’t know
[S11] Well, yeah, you could /if it’s a recessive gene, you could
[S12] Lefty /[inaudible]
[S11] Yeah, left hand is recessive, red hair is recessive, blue eyes, blonde hair, light eyes are recessive /so if you have recessive gene, you could pass anything /so it’s /anything that’s genetic can be tweaked /theoretically /they don’t have the science to do it all yet, but they could
[S9] But, I mean I used to be /I don’t think that’s right /I mean I think that you could kinda compare that even to /I mean that sounds to me like something the Nazis wanted to do
[S11] That’s exactly what I was about to say
[S9] I mean 
[S11] Ok, I want every kid I’m gonna have to have blue haired
[Laughter]
[S11] Blonde-haired, blue-eyed, white skin or red head, green eyes /you know /like 
[S9] I mean /wow 
[S11] I think that’s just messing with nature.
[S9] Yeah
[S12] A little too much
[S11] A little too much?  A lot too much. 
[S10] Some people say that it’s just /I’m not supporting it in any way /[laughter] /um /they say that that /um / it’s an extension of this idea /well if you know that say you’re child is going to have autism or what not /you can go in and change that so as to suit what you want to do /can’t you change and do that
[S11] Well they can’t /they can’t change /when it comes to things like that /I think what you’re thinking of is in the future /right now, the only they can do is abort the child / they can’t fix autism or down’s syndrome /they can’t do that /not yet /anyway
[S10] No, you’re right, that was just a thought /disease
[S11] But, like /who gives you the right to go in a tweak with somebody’s genetics?
[S9] Yeah
[How do you guys feel about a possible amendment to ban gay marriage? Do you think that the Federal Government should be involved at all?]
[S9] I think that the government has bigger problems that they need to worry about.
[S11] But, I think /I would be furious /I’m not gonna lie /that was that /when you said that my first thought was like I would be furious /my actual first thought was oh, I’m an expatriate
[Laughter]
[S11] I’m moving to Europe.
[S12] You probably would have like a lot of people moving to Europe, right? 
[S11] But
[S10] That’s what my friend said that /uh /he was serious /that uh if ever that did come to pass that he would just up and leave
[S11] I’m dead serious. I was a German citizen until I turned eighteen /I would go get my German citizenship back /I would give /like I would be living in Germany /that /that’s just /I think that’s way too 
[S12] A little personal /I mean like they don’t tell you who you can marry of the opposite sex
[S11] Exactly /ok, if they do that they have to say, ok Catholics can only marry Catholics /Christians can only marry Christians /Jews can only marry /blondes can only marry blondes /brunettes can only marry /like it’s that kind of thing /it’s not only the religion /it’s more the genetics /it’s just like how dare you tell someone how to live their life /and, I don’t mean /cause this isn’t hurting anyone
[S12] No, not at all.
[S11] It’s not hurting anyone. 
[S12] Probably helping people /like kids that wouldn’t necessarily have a stable home have people to be adopted by
[S11] Like now /people /and a lot of people /a lot of gay relationships that aren’t technically unions want to adopt and they can’t /because they won’t /a lot of places won’t /even the Federal government won’t give up children to families that are /or to people that are homosexual /which just boggles my mind
[S9] Yeah
[S11] Because there’s so many people /there’s so many children that could have homes where they’re loved and stable and taken care of /and because people are close-minded /they don’t /that just doesn’t make sense
[S10] Another statistic /I just /don’t know if it’s accurate /or the source /[laughter]
[S11] It’s ok
[S9] Throw it out there.
[S11] Throw it on the table. Poker
[S10] Um, but /um /the general trend at least is that gay couples tend to show less dissension or greater cooperation than heterosexual couples /I don’t know if that’s true or not
[S11] I’ve heard that also, actually.
[S10] In the sense of /like /in the sense of rather than they’re being conflict over like things that could be written as like a gender difference /um /that there’s a heightened level of understanding between people with similar needs and expectations /and
[S11] Which makes sense
[10] That as a result of that /that it would provide a better environment in which to raise a child 
[S11] I can actually really vouch for that because with my parents /my parents, my Dad and my brother /me and my Mom /so there’s always the split /now that my brother is old enough, and I’m old enough /there’s the split /oh, it’s a woman thing /oh, it’s a man thing /and I can totally see where that makes absolute sense because there’s always the fact that we’re /oh, we have to stay home because I’m the woman, and you’re working because you’re the man kinda thing /and it doesn’t happen /it wouldn’t happen
[S9] I mean gay couples /it isn’t likely /they have their own problems regardless of what /I mean they should still at least be given the same chance heterosexual couples are given
[S11] And, if you think about it /technically they’re not allowed to be listed as next of kin /if they’re not married /they can’t be married as next of kin /um /I had a /I know a situation where my friend’s uncle /he had a life partner and he died /and he wasn’t allowed at the funeral because the family didn’t want him there /he wasn’t allowed to say goodbye /he wasn’t allowed to get /keep anything from the house /he was evicted from the house /he wasn’t allowed to take anything /no memories, no photos, no nothing because he didn’t have any rights when it came to it /and , it’s just /they had been together for forty-five years, forty-five years, and they had no /they gave him no rights 
[S9] That’s longer than most marriages.
[S11] It’s longer than most marriages now.
[S12] Forty-five years? It’s a lot longer.
[S11] I know, but like it’s just /he had no rights whatsoever /he didn’t /nothing, nothing /didn’t get his pension /didn’t get anything /it just /ugh /doesn’t make sense /so we’re all kind of in agreement about the whole /it’s ok /it doesn’t hurt anyone /why not have it?
[S9] Got any more statistics?
[Laughter]
[Yeah, throw them out there /anything /you could make them up]
[S11] I mean, what changed your mind when you met your friends? I mean is it just the way they /did you have an opinion about how gay people were in general or
[S10] Just, I was incredibly close-minded /it was /um /probably right before high school /um / and I just went on the assumption, and like based on what I was told and based on what I had heard /um / like they were some group to be shunned, they were just there to intentionally weird out other folks /which is completely ludicrous
[S11] Oh, some people of any group do that.
[S10] Right, but I thought this applied to everyone /[inaudible]
[S11] Everyone
[S10] But, like then a friend of mine just sends me an email one day and says, look I’m gay /and like he sent it to two people /me and another friend
[S11] So you were the first people he came out to, or?
[S10] Yeah, and was like I probably will need your help now more than ever /because he was having some problems telling his parents /and his Mom sent him to a therapist to like get that checked /cause she didn’t believe him /and his Dad just /I /he still doesn’t get along too well with his father because of that /um /or at least it didn’t help anything /so it’s just /based on what he has told me /and another friend of mine /um /is bisexual /she hasn’t told her parents that /um /but, her friends and everyone /they’re very supportive of her /but, for her parents to know /they’re really traditional Indian parents /it wouldn’t be good
[Laughter]
[S11] I mean I think when you have traditional /in any culture /it’s gonna shake the /shake the walls a little bit /so /cause like oh my God, if I even /like /if anyone in my family ever told my grandmother that they /oi /I just went Yiddish for a second, I apologize /um /but, I mean it just /it was a whole just complete, automatic turn-around for you or did it take time? /I’m just curious
[S10] Um / like I was sort of confused at first, but like given a day /I just thought through it like /he’s still one of my closest friends /I’ve known him this long, I’m not gonna up and leave and /it just made me reassess what I had previously thought and /um / and I called him afterwards and saw that everything was fine /still talked to him 
[S11] You still friends with him?
[S10] Yeah, he came by to visit like a while ago.
[S9] I can’t help but think that /sorry /that an amendment banning gay marriage would do anything else but just enforce and encourage more people to discriminate against gays and be more hostile against them.
[S11] Definitely /and I mean the fact that his mother sent him to a therapist because something was wrong /ugh
[S12] One of my closest friends from home /who I played soccer with my whole life /um / he went to the University of South Carolina /where he /um / he came out /um / I guess his junior /going into summer /year /um junior summer in high school /and um /he /you know /he was one of the top athletes /uh /at our school /which was like a factory for soccer players /it was like /he was in the spotlight /you know what I mean / yeah /people knew who he was and his family /Lean family /Lean is his last name /sure, it doesn’t make a difference /um / the family was like the first soccer family of my area /like three older sisters and older brother all went to like UNC /multiple really good schools for soccer /and his Dad was an All-American at the University of Pennsylvania /so his parents in no way /still don’t know about it /uh because they /they wouldn’t want to know, but he’s brought back like his boyfriends /his boyfriends from high /from college /from the University of South Carolina, which in itself was /I mean he went there because they offered him a full soccer scholarship and they’re really good /not because they were gonna offer him the best benefits culturally /you know /for what he was looking for obviously /and, um /but hanging out with him now /opposed to when he was like a sophomore in high school, and we didn’t know /is like a thousand times better because he is actually himself for the first time /and I think that’s what like being straight or whatever you are /and, but you’re not homosexual /and you’re making all these judgments about /what it all really breaks down to /for me at least, is just the people /to be yourself /like in a lot of ways, your sexuality is very important /you can’t hide half of who you are /you know /cause then you’re never gonna actually understand /you know /the person /or they won’t actually be able to express themselves fully towards you because they’re constantly living a lie /and when /if you’re gonna ban that or keep making people hide under the /you know
[S9] And then you feel the only way you can have kids is if you do a conventional, heterosexual marriage /and then you
[S11] You’re lying to yourself
[S12] Absolutely
[S9] And the whole family
[S12] Right /that happens way too often
[S11] I was really lucky, my high school /um /it was an all girls school, but anyone that was /was very open with who they were /and I /two of my best friends from my high school are dating, and I am so happy to finally see them together because they danced around it for four years /but we all kinda knew, and it didn’t really matter /we were /I feel really lucky to have had that environment because there was nobody that was shunned for anything in that kind of situation
[S12] I want to ask you /um /what part of the country are you from?
[S11] New York City
[S12] New York City, well
[S11] Which I absolutely know /that’s why
[S12] And that’s 
[S11] And I feel absolutely lucky for it because
[S12] Right, and like we’re all gonna sit here and preach to the choir cause I’m positive like everyone in this room is from like one of five states /you know what I’m saying
[S11] Where are you guys from?
[S10] Maryland
[S9] New Jersey
[S12] And Pennsylvania and New York
[S11] What part of Pennsylvania are you from?
[S12] Swarthmore, the most liberal part of Pennsylvania /Swarthmore, Pennsylvania
[S11] My Mom grew up in Lancaster. That’s all I have to say.
[S9] I’m from northern New Jersey like ten minutes from New York City.
[S11] Ok, yeah /so 
[S12] Right /so I mean like we all have situations where like our friends come out and that’s the best thing that’s happened to them /but, like there’s vast parts of our country where people /not only do they not come out, but should they come out /will not be living where their home is
[S11] Well, I’ve had situations like that too, actually /um / my uh /one of my best friends back home came out to her family /she lived in /um / Stroudsburg /kicked her out of the house /I mean it’s /she came to live with her step Mom who got divorced from her Dad /she accepted her /it’s completely different in other parts of the world
[S12] Yeah, people in the rest of the world [inaudible] homosexuality in general
[S11] The rest of the world with a lot of things in general /really /America’s kind of puritan /a little bit /you know like it’s the 21st Century /um and it’s just /it’ scary thought sometimes to just think about how different the majority of our country thinks about it /it’s scary /I don’t know about you guys /it scares the shit out of me
