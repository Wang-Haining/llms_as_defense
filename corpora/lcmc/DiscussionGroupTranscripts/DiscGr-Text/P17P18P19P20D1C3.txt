GROUP 17181920
CATHOLIC CHURCH
[Is everyone ready to begin? In your opinion does the catholic church need to change it’s ways to adapt to life in the 21st century?]
[participant laughter] 
[Who would like to begin?]
[S18] Um/ I don’t think it’s /Isn’t there a second part of the question too about the priest’s scandal, the sexual abuse scandal?
[You can talk about that too]
[S18] [laughter] 
Ok/ Well I was gonna say
[S17] Do you like memorize these questions?
[laughter]
[S18] Yeah, yeah I know, but they kinda coincide for me /I mean with the catholic church I don’t think there’s anything so outdated where like/ alright let’s see [inaudible] /like we need to turn the catholic church up on it’s ears and completely reform it /But, um /Cause some of the stuff with like the priests and the sexual abuse scandal /I mean priests went centuries without feeling the need to do that.
[S20] Oh you don’t know that it might just not have been 
[S18] I mean there’s always the conspiracy that /but I mean /it’s gotten along for two millennia just fine, so I don’t think /and I mean there was the second Vatican, in the 60’s?
[S20] I don’t know
[S18] I don’t know /something like that /but I mean I don’t think that there’s so much wrong in the catholic church right now that it needs to be updated, but if it did at any point become obvious that it needs to be updated /I would be all for it /I mean I think it could be updated now, but there’s no pressing/there’s no real necessity to it at this point.
[S17] I think things /like we talked about gay marriage before /a lot of people are for it, but the catholic church isn’t and if the catholic church were they’d probably be fine with it. So, maybe that’s one aspect where they could just generally go more with the 21st century view of things.
[S18] What’s the exact wording of the question again?
[Um, in your opinion does the catholic church need to change it’s ways to adapt to life in the 21st century?]
[S18] Change it’s ways I think is the key phrase /I mean that’s not /I wouldn’t say /like maybe they could change one idea /but I still don’t think even if they did like the gay marriage /they said like alright /I still don’t think/besides the obvious like functionality of the sense of like marriage and stuff /I don’t think they would need to change like the fundamental way they work.
[S17] I think the beliefs are fine, but it’s more of like how they practice them.
[S19] But, I feel like if you’re gonna /Ok, sorry /If you’re gonna /sorry
[S18] Can you /Can you expand on that? Do you mind if /the way they practice it?
[S17] Well, I don’t know /it’s just the catholic church reputation for being like close-minded.
[S18] I think people are so /they’re so like/they misunderstand the catholic church so much that it’s, it’s a crime /and like I do, I, I am not like a strong catholic at all /I mean I consider myself a catholic /like I disagree and I believe what I want to /it just happens, it just happens that I follow the catholic church more closely than most.
[S20] That’s because you’re raised that way.
[S18] Well/ no [laughter] /I mean I was raised /like my dad’s really /but I’m still not /like I’m not as religious as my dad/but um /I just think as a whole I mean there’s so many that call themselves catholic and um have nothing to do with it. I don’t know /it’s just a shame /the way it’s construed.
[S20] Very true. I know a lot of people ya know that they say they’re catholic and they do not show it at all. 
[S18] I mean there’s a certain level of
[S20] Just catholic by name 
[S18] Yeah, I know. Like there’s a certain level of like participation and like /yeah a certain sense of like community/that you need to participate in /I mean you can’t just call yourself a catholic and be like oh yeah I mean I went to church like last Easter
[S19] [inaudible]
[S18] Yeah 
[S17] Well I mean that’s the problem with like every religion I think. People just cling to a part of it until it really [inaudible]
[S20] I mean I’m catholic but like I’m going to mass after this /to get my ashes for ash Wednesday /I mean that’s /I can actually say I am because I actually do the actual practice.
[S18] Yeah.
[S17] But there’s more to being a catholic than
[S20] Well yeah /you need to lead your actual life
[S18] But, I’m, I’m just sayin’
[S17] A lot of people think that since they go to church every weekend like they’re set. But, that’s also another way you can misinterpret it.
[S18} Yeah I mean I don’t go to church every week
[S17] But, you do other things
[S18] But, but I think I try to live as a catholic /I mean I don’t think I could I go to church [laughter] /I think I’d have to go to confession once or go to confession a couple of times before I could receive again /Yeah.
[S20] Well just throwing this out there /when you receive that’s basically saying you’re forgiven of all your sins.
[S18] Not if you have a mortal sin.
[S20] Well, ok
[laughter]
[S18] Yeah, but like /yeah /there’s, there’s like some couple /one thing /um / me and this friend worked with this one kid/like really muslim /like really into the muslim /I mean I don’t know /he was like this regular guy /just happened to be really into Islam /so we were talking to him and he thought /uh /he didn’t know /and we went and we back into work and asked a bunch of people if they knew this and no one did /that catholics believe that if you’re catholic, if you’re a Jew, if you’re a Muslim, you can all get into heaven /that is true
[S19] So catholics believe that like Muslims can get into heaven, but Protestants can’t?
[S18] No, you’re /uh /Christian
[S19] Well you said Catholics.
[S18] Oh /Christians sorry /you’re damned to hell /no
[laughter]
[S18] Christian, Jew /right?
[S20] Why not muslims?
[S18] I’m pretty sure /right?
[S20] This is news to me /uh
[S18] No /I,I,I was almost positive
[S20] Ya know what /this is how the people nowadays are more lenient /ya know if people aren’t catholic, they’re not gonna go to hell in my opinion
[S18] No, no they aren’t /exactly
[S20] If you’re a good person /ya know /goin to hell /no /that’s bull crap in my opinion
[S17] So you think it’s like a more personality thing?
[S20] Yeah, totally.
[S18] Yeah, well it is. 
[S20] Nowadays, it isn’t like as strict /like we don’t have nuns like pray now in class.
[S18] Yeah /well I grew up with that but
[S20] Oh really?
[S18] Well we said pray is like [inaudible] /but it’s not like you’re gonna go to hell /it’s not like that /literal fear instilled in you / I mean there’s fear of God in that sense /but not that literal fear I think you’re referring to as in the old days.
[S19] Purgatory
[S18] Yeah /well purgatory /but um /yeah /but if you talk to like a catholic and you talk to a muslim /they will have more of their beliefs in common than a catholic and a fundamentalist Christian /that is true.
[S20] Some of it’s true.
[S18] No, no, no I mean some of these fundamentalist Christians /I mean between that and like 
[S17] What do you mean by fundamentalist Christian? 
[S18] Fundamentalist Christian? Like um
[S17] Like Catholics? Extreme Catholics?
[S18] No, no, these people are not Catholics. I don’t um
[S17] Do they claim to be Catholic though?
[S18] No they don’t claim to be Catholic at all /but um /um /I’m not trying to offend anyone here
[S20] Southern Baptist? Is that what you’re trying to get to?
[S18] Well /no but
[S19] I don’t know what you mean
[S18] I’m trying to like define it more.
[S20] Who’s that Indian guy that like beats people on the head?
[S18] That guy’s awesome. [laughter] I don’t care/he’s like going to hell but/that guy’s crazy /he smacked an old woman in the head/did you see that one?
[S19] Oh my God,
[S18] He’s like one of those faith healers that they televise /he’s like give me your money and I will free you of your sins/there’s an old woman who’s like crippled and he like smacked her in the face
[S19] I can’t believe that’s the good thing to do.
[S18] We’re kinda getting’ off topic/but like people who /I wish I woulda prepared my views /usually I’m
[S20] I believe that /well first of all everybody always picks on Catholics /I mean what the crap stop it
[S18] No, they can pick on us /let them pick on us
[S20] No /but
[S18] No cause if they keep pickin on us /I mean they’re gonna keep pickin on us and eventually they’re gonna get something wrong /and they’re gonna misunderstand something and we can say well /I mean I pick on the catholic church
[laughter]
[S20] Yeah /well I mean you gotta be able to joke about yourself in order to joke around with other people /that’s ya know /I joke about the catholic church all the time /uh /but I believe that it is a religion /why should you change your religion to suit people’s wants more so than needs. Why should the catholic church change for people want gay marriages /they don’t need that
[S17] I feel like in views like that /like more political views /like gay marriage, abortion,things like that /if the catholic church has to change their views on that then every other denomination has to change their views on that.
[S18] Exactly /I mean like 
[S17] So
[S20] Everybody’s pickin on us Catholics
[S18] I know but / I
[S17] So when it says like change their ways /I feel like they are referring to priesthood, and priests not being able to marry and no women priests/things like that
[S20] Well I mean it is a religion like I said /um /can you repeat the last part that you were saying?
[S18] You go for the recruitment of female priests and allow priests to marry?
[S17] Yeah /well I’m just saying I feel like change your ways can’t apply to like principles stuff like that /Cause then like every person in the world that feels that gays shouldn’t be allowed to marry has to change the way they think about it /ya know?
[S18] Yeah, I think that /um
[S19] What about like female priests,like you said?
[S17] I mean basically our society is moving towards gender equality and women’s rights and things like that but
[S20] That’s for another discussion
[laughter]
[S17] Ok /to have Catholicism opposed to that seems like counterproductive towards society’s rules /so
[S20] If people have a problem with it /I mean they can convert /I mean they don’t need to change the views of the entire church just because of their views.
[S17] Don’t you think less and less people will become Catholic?
[S20] I really don’t care how many people are catholic. I just want the religion to be the way it is /cause that’s what the people believe
[S17] But then
[S20] I really don’t care how many people
[S18] I would actually say that the female priests /I see that as the closest thing that’s gonna come to a head first in reforming the catholic church /I mean cause it’s gonna be like a functional thing /I mean what are you gonna have /I mean people joining seminaries is down /I mean it just doesn’t make sense in my opinion to not let females be priests.
[S17] That’s just because our society’s so accepting of women /and if other things change in out society like we become more accepting of gay marriage then we’d probably want the catholic church to change it
[S18] Well then again /you’re talking about the catholic church /you’re not talking about the catholic church in the United States
[S19] That’s true
[S18] That’s a big point / we just, we just kinda overlooked throughout this whole
[S20] I never even considered that
[S18] There’s, there’s /my favorite story/my best friend is Polish /his cousin is Polish /he’s afraid to tell his mom about his best friend because he’s a Jew /he lives in Poland /his cousin is 31 years old /it’s like that embedded in other cultures /I mean /we’re kinda liberal /we’re very liberal compared to other countries /I mean there’s like Poland /Roman Catholic /just like /I don’t know
[S20] Especially with all of our ways
[S18] What do you mean all of our ways?
[S20] As in like the way people doubt worship nowadays /the people used to be like memorize prayers, kneel down seriously, you never crack a smile /Nowadays you break out the guitar /all that stuff /it’s just a lot more liberal way of worship
[S19] That’s how it is here, but that doesn’t mean that’s how it is everywhere else.
[S20] No, I’m talking about in the United States.
[S19] And I think in order for /like it’s not the United States where the catholic Church is gonna change. I think it’s gotta be in Europe first /ya know /cause that’s where it originated and that’s where it’s roots are from
[S18] Yeah /or I mean we can’t have like a United States coup of the Catholic Church
[laughter]
Where we all like fly [inaudible]
[S19] Yeah /so I feel like changing the catholic church is like in regards to 
women being priests /I don’t know if that will happen
[S18] Exactly. Cause like over here its like yeah why not /over in Europe I mean who knows /its like what?! [laughter]
[S18} I don’t understand it’s like
[S17] But then honestly I don’t think it’s like taking away from the religion that women can’t be priests. That may be sexist but [laughter]/ I’m a girl and I don’t think that women should be priests
[S20] Wait /what? Can you repeat that?
[S19] By limiting them you don’t think that it’s a big deal
[S17] Yeah kind of
[S18] Oh. Disallowing women is like whatever?
[S17] Yeah, I mean I think it’s like unfair to the women that want to be priests /but I don’t think like it’s gonna bring like
[S20] Well I mean it’d be nice but
[S17] Yeah /but I don’t think that it would necessarily bring anything more to
[S18] It’d be weird first /I mean I admit it /going to church and seeing a girl priest /it’s be like woah
[S20] Well I mean everything’s weird with change
[S18] Wow /in the words of flava flave
[S19] Like I don’t even know/like I feel like a women priest wouldn’t get as much respect /people wouldn’t necessarily go/be gung-ho to go to a church with a woman priest /I feel like it would be hard for
[S18] Gender discrimination
[S19] I’m not saying that’s a reason why women shouldn’t be allowed to be priests but I’m just saying it would be hard for a women priest to get the same respect in the church.
[S17] Yeah
[S20] Well that’s just general in the world today. Guys generally get more respect than women. And that’s not in the U.S. That’s in the entire world.
[S17] Yeah, but to combat it/the only thing to do would be to let women be priests [inaudible]
[S18] Well who knew we were gonna have the priests facing us when they were saying mass? Who knew we were gonna have mass spoken in English? I mean just go back a hundred years.
[S19] It’s true.
[S20] Not even a hundred years with the 
[S18] Well I’m just saying a hundred years cause we couldn’t pinpoint it earlier. So I’m just saying a hundred years.
[S20] The Latin masses were set up til like the 60’s or 70’s.
[S19] Completely?
[S20] Yeah. Everything was in Latin /couldn’t understand a word
[S18] It was like oh this is what this part means
[S17] If it took that long for the catholic church to change that aspect I think
[S18] Yeah exactly
[S17] I think women priests is a whole different can of worms.
[S18] That’s not even /that’s not even like an issue right now /that’s not even like on the table for discussion /it’s just like ah nope not gonna happen /no way no how /I’m not saying that’s the way it should be but
[S20] And I mean /I’m not /probably goes back to discrimination but only males were priests probably for some reason when religion /actually ya know what /I take that back /I really don’t know
[S18] That was the culture back then.
[S20] Yeah /that was the culture so it may not have been a really terrific reason but on the other hand it may have been.
[S18] Well it was just like /back then it just wouldn’t have made sense for a woman to be a priest /like what?
[S17] And I mean even in the bible /in the old testament the person that was considered a priest is one who gives a sacrifice for a community and like all you hear about is men in the bible that did that.
[S18] Ooo. Whippin out the primary source.
[laughter]
[S17] So obviously, if the catholic church is gonna base their practice on what is biblical and what is biblical obviously men are head of the family /they are head of most things
[S20] Let’s go back to the /uh /respect issue that you brought up.
[S19] It’s really hard to base things on the bible though cause there’s so many ways to interpret it. You can construe it however you want.
[S18] Agreed.
[S19] That’s why churches are so different.
[S17] That was the problem with the Protestant church. 
[S18] Well yeah, you could use the Bible to argue any point/anyways/just like God said so!
[S19] Cause it’s kind of inconsistent within itself and you don’t know how literal or how figuratively to take things.
[S18] And no one knows how many authors there are.
[Well /um /regarding all the accusations against catholic priests regarding pedophilia/do you think that these could have been prevented if the catholic church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]
[S20] I feel as though /as though a majority of them probably would have been prevented /um /but I mean that’s just a personal issue for those priests /I mean they’re screwed up in the head.
[S19] I think especially the being allowed to marry could affect it /with female priests I mean I don’t really see that connection as much.
[S18] I don’t /I don’t know about that /there is some dividing line here /I don’t know how think it is, between saying wow that women’s beautiful and wow that 12 year old boy’s beautiful /I mean you gotta have something predisposed up in your head to find
[S20] It’s a pretty thick line
[S18] Uh /yeah it’s a pretty thick line /yeah /but /I think there’s gotta be something else /I mean I don’t know
[S19] It might not have come out though
[S17] I mean it could have helped like honestly you don’t’ know /[laughter] /but like at the same time there are men that are married that still are like pedophiles so
[S18] Yeah. Exactly /I mean that’s the point that I’m tryin to make.
[S19] I wonder if the majority of pedophiles are married or unmarried.
[S20] I’d imagine unmarried.
[S18] Uh /yeah I would imagine unmarried as well.
[S20] Just cause they’re not getting
[S19] Well like if it’s true that more unmarried are pedophile then it would be like repressed sexual desires that are causing them to do these things to children which would mean that priests would be more likely to be pedophiles because they have repressed sexual desires /so that would be an argument for it
[S20] That’s still not a good reason to be a pedophile.
[S19] It’s not a reason
[S17] It’s a contributing factor
[S18] Self-control /there’s the overwhelming majority of catholic priests /well who knows overwhelming /but there is catholic priests who find it perfectly easy to go throughout the day and not destroy and not destroy some 12 year old boy’s psyche /I mean like it is possible /these, these priests should be like tortured.
[S17] Yeah I feel like it’s more at the fault of the Priest than it is with the religion cause
[S20] Yes, that’s a good point.
[S17] Because if you have those feelings anyways then you have no business being a priest.
[S19] Well, yeah. You definitely need the priest to have something messed up inside of him to want to do that.
[S18] To become a priest?
[laughter]
[S19] To become a pedophile. But the church might also contribute to it. It can exist without the person also being messed up and it can exist without the church.
[S20] Naa. He’s probably messed up if he goes for a little boy.
[S19] Well yeah/ but that goes without saying.
[S18] So you’re saying it can’t exist without him being messed up and it can exist without the church?
[S19] Yeah.
[S18] That’s what you said?
[S19] Yeah/ I think I meant to say that.
[S18] Well that’s what you said. Is that what you meant?
[S19]I think /well /let me try and explain it. You definitely the person to be messed up in order for them to be a pedophile and if the church.
[Laughter]
[S18] This is great terminology we’re using here /there has to be a predisposition to
[S19] A predisposition towards pedophilia /um /and if the church says that he can’t marry it may also contribute to it but only if he already has that predisposition.
[S18] So you’re sayin it a crapshoot, right?
[laughter]
[S19] So if the church said marriage was not fine as it currently is /it wouldn’t make priests who weren’t already predisposed toward pedophilia become pedophiles /they have to have that already.
[S17] Any psych majors? /diathesis-stress model?
[Laughter]
[S17] Um /it’s you inherit the risk of developing a psychological disorder and it may or may not be triggered by the environment. So obviously priesthood would be the nurturing environment
[S19] But they already have to have the predisposition.
[S18] But that means you’re predisposed/means that somewhere in your lineage the male was a priest /correct?
[S19] What?
[S17] No, you’re predisposed towards pedophilia not towards priesthood.
[S18] I see /I was saying there’s something, something, another piece to the puzzle
[laughter]
[S20] The church doesn’t necessarily need to change their views in my opinion /uh /they can however change their ways /in that /um /when the priests do go um before they are priests /when they do go to become a priest/ um /ya know they obviously need to go through changing /they don’t just oh you’re a priest /they obviously need to get tested and everything /but um /maybe if they tested them more so /I can’t really explain it /on um how they generally tend to flow /um /be more strenuous in that area/obviously that would limit some /uh we don’t really have a good flow of people going to become priests right now /this would obviously diminish that even more which stinks for us /but obviously that’s worth getting those creep shows out of the church /I wanna smack em’ in the face
[S18] Wait /psychological evaluations?
[S20] Yeah,yeah.
[S18] I think there should be real evaluations /cause I don’t think /Is there any real evaluation process right now? Yeah /I don’t think
[S20] Need like a lie detector or something
[S19] I feel like as soon as you’re a priest, you’re a priest.
[S18] Then again, I believe that people should have like psych like driver’s license tests every year /so maybe I’m skewed towards/that would suck
[S17] That would
[S19] That would be helpful /well /maybe not every year but every like five years
[S18] I just bought that up cause maybe that skews my opinion
[S20] You guys think like psychological tests more strenuous to become priests would be a good idea?
[S18] Of course /it’s always a good thing.
[S20] Yeah exactly /but ya know/the way/church doesn’t exactly need to change it’s views to please people but they can change their ways in that process /it’s not really changing their religion /just weeding out the good from the bad
[S18] Making it better,stronger, faster
[laughter]
[S20] Sounds like an army commercial
[S19] Do you think there’d be like enough priests like that if they weeded out people?
[S20] We already do have a low flow
[S19] Especially compared to the historically/less people wanna be priests nowadays I’d say
[S18] People sharing priests /sharing churches
[S20] It’s like a very sexual oriented society we live in today so that’s obviously like a main reason why people don’t want to become a priest /on the other hand that’s also what is giving priests the trouble /so that’s another thing to look at /anyone wants to expand on that? Cause I really have nothing to talk about.
[laughter]
[S17] So changing that one point of view/it would attract more people to priesthood /but then it would be sacrificing one of the principles of the religion
[S18] Exactly /one of the whole keys to symbolism there is you’re supposed to be married to the church /so I mean I think what would/ in a way if you’re thinking about it /you’d probably allow female priests before you’d allow priests to marry
[S20] Or maybe priests marry the female priests?
[Laughter]
[S18] It could be one big threesome of catholic love
[laughter]
Sorry if I’m using slang /vulgar terminology
[S20] I’m not gonna say anything cause I know I’ll upset my grandfathers /all that stuff /up in heaven /dead silence
[Do you guys have anymore thoughts?]
[S18] I think we’ll wrap it up with a threesome of catholic love.
[laughter]
[Ok, end of discussion]
