MARIJUANA

[Everyone ready to begin? And try to speak up if you can to. Ok. So everything gets heard /  The city of Denver has decided to legalize small amounts of marijuana for person’s over 21. How do you feel about this? And / who would like to begin? Anyone have a thought?]

[S22] Decriminalized it / didn’t they? / So if you’re caught with it you just get fined instead of it being a criminal charge

[S21] Did they?

[S22] Yea 

[Do you just want to explain a little more about what you’ve heard about that?]

[S22] Um / yea / uh / I / I think it was different from California cause it wasn’t like a medical use statute / it was a / it was a decriminalization / so it takes it from a status of a criminal charge / which is permanent on your record to more like a traffic ticket / so if you’re caught with a small / like selling is still a felony / but if you’re caught with a small amount you don’t have like / a bail set or a mandatory minimum sentence / it’s like a slap on the wrist / kind of like a traffic ticket would be

[S24] I thought it was that / that we were actually legalizing it in small amounts / not that there was any ticket / I mean / just from reading the question / I wasn’t sure though

[S21] Yea / that’s what I thought

[S23] Yea

[Is that / you / you heard that about Denver?]

[S22] Yea / yea / maybe I’m wrong / but / either way 

[S21] Well / if it was [laughter]

[S22] Yea / I mean 

[Yea / what are your feelings towards that / I mean / anyone]

[S22] It’s like / half legalization

[S21] Yea

[S22] It’s like / pretty much

[S21] I think / um / I know when we were talking about it / like / in chat / or like whatever like that / um / like / we were talking about like / this versus alcohol / like legalization or whatever / and like / we felt like / if you were gonna legalize it / then / you can’t just legalize it in a small amount / like who’s gonna say what’s a small amount / so / either legalize it or don’t legalize it / so that’s kinda what we decided on

[S23] Yea / I mean / there’s no way to keep people from getting drunk on alcohol and there’s no way to keep them from going overboard on pot either

[S21] Right / right

[S23] So

[S21] Yea

[S24] That was my huge debate / was how they were planning on rationing out

[S21] Deciding on what’s a small amount / Yea

[S23] Yea

[S24] And then [inaudible] controlling it so they know you’re only having that one small amount at a time / so if I go to several different stores / I’m getting small amount at each place and stockpiling

[S21] Right 

[S23] Right

[S22] Well I mean / yea / in / in L.A though / it’s a lot easier to get it cause you can go to doctors who will write you a prescription and then you can go to any one of the number of stores / and you can just pick it up

[S21] Yea

[S22] It’s just if / I mean / either way / I guess in terms of court fees / like / it costs the state a lot to bring people in and book ‘em in jail and put them through an appeals process

[S23] Right

[S21] Yea

[S22] and pay for probation and all that kind of stuff / so / I guess it’d / it’d be interesting to know if there’s a correlation between this and / all the things that people say are the harmful effects / like / ya know / car accidents

[S21] And I’m like / I’m really not that sure on like / what / like what are long term effects of / like 

[S24] I mean / I’ve only read up on it briefly / I don’t understand it to be that much worse than Alcohol or cigarette smoking for that matter

[S21] Yea / I have no idea / right / I’ve heard cigarettes were almost worse / that’s what I 

[S22] Well / yea / cause they have same / like by volume / they have just the same amount of carcinogens / but the thing is like / a cigarette smoker will smoke like / like three or four cigarettes a day / and a pothead’ll smoke like half a / a half a cigarette worth / and be / and good

[S21] More than / often / right

[S23] Yea / that’s true

[S21] Yea 

[S22] I think / the effects / it’s probably like / I think just from what I’ve heard / I think respiratory / the respiratory effects are the worst

[S23] Yea / yea / that’s probably the biggest one / I don’t know / like when I looked at it online / a lot of places said that / um / the exact effects weren’t really clear

[S21] Right

[S23] Like / there hadn’t been enough done to determine it / and / I mean / marijuana’s been around a long time

[Laughter]

[S21] Yea

[S23] And why wouldn’t / someone have researched that by now

[S21] Yea

[S22] Well / the chemical that actually does what it does / breaks down into like / four or five hundred different compounds

[S21] Really?

[S23] Wow.

[S22] Yea / and they all / do / but that’s like / I guess that’s after / the use and whatnot / but like / yea

[S21] So like / if they were gonna legalize it / I think that would have to be made a lot more clear to everybody 

[S22] Yea / yea

[S23] Yea / that’s

[S21] Otherwise / either / I don’t know 

[S23] That’s probably the biggest thing / would be the health risks / for people who didn’t / who never wanted to do it / cause it was illegal / but now that it’s legal they’re like / oh / let me try this and 

[S21] Right / uh-huh

[S24] I mean / the only thing I’ve seen online about it / is something about memory loss

[S21] Yea

[S23] Yea

[S24] And / obviously if you smoke anything

[S21] Yea

[S23] Right / yea

[S24] Regardless of what the smoke is / you’re gonna have respiratory problems

[S21] Right

[S24] So

[S22] And / I mean / it’s fat soluble too / so / it stays in your system / I mean / depending on the like the frequency of how you smoke it / it stays in your system cause it binds to your fat cells / which is why / like / it stays in your system for 30 days afterwards / is because / like / when that fat is broken down that’s how like you can test / yea

[S21] Oh / that’s why they can like test it and stuff

[S23] Doesn’t LSD do the same thing?

[S22] Unlike Alcohol

[S23] And that’s why you have / like flashbacks?

[S22] I think / LSD goes to your spine.

[S23] Really?

[S22] Yea

[S21] Yea

[S23] Oh / I thought it was like / I thought it was / stored in your fat a little / and like released years later

[S22] It might be / it might be / I don’t know

[S21] Really? Oh wow [Laughter]

[S23] So that’s / well that’s why they get like / have you heard like / people get flashbacks / and all of a sudden they think/  they’re in / weird places

[S21] Right

[S23] Yea / so that’s weird to think like / marijuana having an effect like that / but

[S22] Yea / I mean 

[S23] I’ve never heard that with it.

[S22] It seems like / you hear a lot about people / doing stupid things when they’re drunk / right?

[S21] Right

[S22] And you hear a lot about people like / running over kids in the street and all that kinda stuff / um / and / the only real bad thing you ever hear about people doing when they’re stoned is getting arrested for / being stoned

[Laughter]

[S21] Right

[S23] Yea

[S22] Which is

[S21] But like / would you think there would be more / like / if it were legalized / do you guys think there would be more like / I guess / driving under the influence / or / things like that

[S22] Well / it wouldn’t be a good idea to legalize it now because it has such a novelty attached to it / that as soon as they legalize it / it would just / it would blow up

[S21] Right

[S22] and / people would have no sense of mind / I mean / it wouldn’t be like / I don’t know / I guess / if you’re like a 16 year old kid and you’re trying to rebel against your parents / doing something that’s against the law is cool 

[Laughter]

[S23] Yea

[S22] Ya know / if it’s not against the law it’s not as cool 

[S24] I mean / and you wonder how many people who’ve actually tried it / and / maybe some people / it’s just enticing because it’s against the law / that’s a factor / so

[S22] Oh / absolutely

[S21] Right

[S22] Absolutely

[S24] It’s just like / maybe then candy at that point / ya know / it’s not illegal / why would I 

[S21] just / it’s like why underage kids / like / whatever

[S23] Right / but that’s still / I mean / there’s still a / a limit / at least in New York / of 18 on cigarettes / and plenty of / 16 year olds go out and buy them

[S21] Right

[S23] So / I mean / they were talking about making the legal age for marijuana 21 / so 

[S21] Yea / you’re still gonna have to deal with like / underage kids buying it

[S23] Yea / Yea

[S24] Cause you’ll have people buying it for them / so

[S21] Right

[S23] That creates kind of like / a whole other black market 

[S21] Yea

[S22] Yea / no / it definitely / cause / it pushes it underground / it’s like / I mean / did / did prohibition do more good or bad? The prohibition of alcohol

[S23] Yea / definitely bad

[S22] Like people got shot / with Tommy guns / all the time [laughter] ya know?

[S23] Yea

[S24] But / you’ve gotta wonder / at the same time / a lot of the crime you read about the in the newspapers / or on / you see on the news / that’s related to drug deals / whether or not / ya know / if it’s not illegal anymore / is that / is that gonna be as much of a problem / drug related shootings / and stuff like that

[S23] Yea / but I mean / are we gonna legalize cocaine?

[S24] Normally that’s a little bit of / I know / and I’m just saying / normally that’s harder drugs

[S23] Yea

[S24] But / um / I mean / certainly there are crimes associated with marijuana too / that you’d think would decrease

[S22] I mean like / I’m not sticking up for it / but like

[S21] Right

[S22] A lot of those crimes are just / are crimes of necessity / because like / I mean / if you live in a place where you really / there are no jobs for you / and / there’s no childcare / and / yea

[S21] It’s just like fight over territory

[S22] Yea

[S21] Like who’s gonna sell where / who’s gonna do whatever

[S22] Exactly

[S21] So / it’s really not even about the drug [laughter] it’s about who has / who’s been selling where [laughter]

[S23] Yea / it’s all business

[S22] yea / it’s about the paper / it’s about the money

[S21] So

[S24] But / if / um / if it was no longer illegal to sell that or have it in possession / it would blow up so much / that that territory issue wouldn’t even be a thing anymore

[S21] I think after a while / like / if they did legalize it / there would be a period where just things would be like / out of control / because / it would be so easy to get to now / it’ll probably be / so much more expensive / then it already is / but / I mean / I think people would still go crazy over it / but / um / I think after a while / it would / kinda / phase out

[S24] It might also be interesting to see / that / if um / if it was legalized / they’d probably start / have companies / that would come up / with it / because you’re not just gonna be buying it off the street

[S22] Yea

[S21] Right

[S23] It’d be so weird

[Laughter]

[S24] And then maybe there would be like standards come up by the

[S21] You could just got to 7-11 and buy pot

[S23] Yea / you’d have like huge / you’d have huge pot fields

[S24] some sort of standards on your marijuana

[S22] it would end up being so commercialized

[S21] Right

[S23] Yea

[S21] That’s so weird

[S22] Yea / I mean / it would end up being a very / very very commercial thing / and / it probably would blow up like that

[S21] Yea

[S22] Like right off the bat

[S24] Definitely

[S21] And it would be really really expensive cause they’d probably / tax / like / put heavy taxes on it

[S22] Oh / Yea

[S23] That’s true

[S22] Well / I mean / the government would make / a lot of money on that / but I think realistically / the economy would slow down

[S21] Yea

[S22] Because everyone would be high all the time

[Laughter]

[S22] So / like

[Laughter]

[S22] People would / I mean / honestly / I think a lot of things / would slow down

[S21] Yea

[S22] If it happened

[S24] I mean / people don’t drink while they work though / I mean / generally speaking

[S23] generally speaking 

[Laughter]

[S23] [Inaudible] the guy with a bottle of scotch in the bottom drawer] 

[Laughter]

[S22] True / true

[Laughter]

[S22] But / it’s like / it’s a different kind of incapacitation though / isn’t it / like / smoking versus drinking 

[S21] I think that / I / I think that / I mean / I wouldn’t / I really don’t know / but I think they’re totally different / just in the way people act

[S23] Yea / I mean / if it lasts longer too / like / you said it stays in your system for a month / like / if a high lasts longer than being drunk even / not like a month / but a / day or so / that could create a lot of problems

[S22] Yea / definitely / I mean / if there’s not as much of a / like / pass out 

[S23] Yea

[S22] Kinda thing / like there is with alcohol / ya know / I don’t know

[S21] The only thing I’d be concerned about is the driving thing / cause I mean / if so many / like if the high lasts for longer and like / just / things like that / I don’t know / like / I don’t know

[S23] Yea 

[S21] I think that would be a lot more common / like / I really don’t hear about that / I really don’t / like / I hear of DWIs but like / not a lot of like / driving under the influence

[S22] No

[S21] Like I really never

[S23] I think it’s starting to become like / a little more a problem

[S21] Yea

[S23] Cause they’ve started having the commercials / like / there’s commercials out about it

[S21] Yea

[S23] And stuff / trying to get / yea / I think that would be like the biggest problem cause / yea

[S22] Well / I mean / I think / like / substances that are illegal in their illegal state they induce people to ask questions

[S21] Right

[S22] If it / from a standpoint of maintaining an ordered society / the questions that you don’t want people to be asking / like / the whole / the whole like / end the Vietnam War era that our parents were all about in the sixties / like / that was / ya know / on Capitol Hill / that was really / people said it was like a drug induced phenomenon

[Laughter]

[S22] Ya know / and I think it just contributed to 

[S21] Right

[S22] To all the outlawing and whatnot / I mean / if someone does something / and they’re like / this is illegal / I’ve heard this is bad my whole life / but / I feel fine

[S21] Yea

[S22] Then it just kinda / downplays / like / just the whole / the whole concept of laws [Laughter]

[S21] Right

[S23] Yea

[S22] Yea / but about the whole crimes of necessity thing / like / people don’t have jobs / that’s why they’re gonna turn to / selling drugs / and whatever 

[S24] But / I mean / if it is legal / even they’ll get pushed away by these / uh / businesses that would come up and start doing it / anyway

[S22] It’s nothing that hasn’t happened before 

[S21] Yea

[S23] Yea 

[S24] You mean like / uh / you’re saying big marijuana stores have come up and push them off before

[S21]  I think they would / but they wouldn’t / because

[S22]  No / I mean / just the consolidation of small businesses into larger ones / that’s what I mean

[S24] I’m just saying / you don’t see people / like / selling gas on the corner because you have a gas station / I’m saying / if you had a store that would sell this drug / you’re really not gonna see them on the corner anymore / cause why would people go to them / when you can go to a trusted business

[S22] Yea

[S21] Unless they’re underage kids / that can’t / which there will be plenty of [Laughter]

[S23] Right / they’ll always / yea 

[S24] Then the people who buy are still gonna go to that store though 

[S23] Yea	

[S22] And / I mean / if it was legal to have / I feel like so many people would not even buy it / they would just grow it / themselves

[S21] Yea / I don’t know

[S23] Yea / like how would that be regulated? Would growing your own pot still be illegal?

[S22] I don’t know. That’s a whole other question 

[S21] Yea / wanna talk about it?

[Laughter] 

[S22] It / it would probably be 

[S21] I think that would still be illegal / only because the amount / only because like / you wouldn’t be growing / like / that much / like 

[S24] You’d think there’d be some sort of license imposed on you 

[S21] Yea

[S23] Yea / good call / like a liquor license [Laughter]

[S24] Yea / something like that / like / exactly like a bar

[S23] Yea

[S24] So you are able to grow and sell it

[S22] That’s what it would probably be

[S21] Yea

[S22] It would be / but then / then enforcing that license would take a whole new / ya know / budgetary concern / cause it’d be expensive

[S24] Same problem enforcing the / liquor licenses nowadays

[S22] Yea / exactly / but you’d probably see the same kind of consolidation / of like / mom and pop grocery stores / and then / Stop and Shops / and Big Y’s / and Wal-Marts / ya know 

[S21] Uh-huh

[S23] Uh-huh

[S22] Which would be interesting 

[S21] Yea / I think it would be crazy / the first / like / right when they do it though / it would just be / insane 

[S22] Well / it would be / but / the whole / the whole attitude of it being taboo / would / would remain

[S21] Uh-huh

[S22] For a while / like / I / I don’t think people would warm up to it / like it would be / I think certain demographics would / jump on it / like shit on Velcro / and certain demographics would still / like / our grandparents wouldn’t be pleased

[S23] Oh yea 

[Laughter]

[S21] G-d willing

[Laughter]

[S22] Yea / seriously 

[Laughter]

[S23] I don’t know about your grandparents

[S22] Yea

[S23] Yea

[S22] I don’t know / it could be very interesting 

[S23] Do you think more people would turn to like harder drugs / if pot was legal / because it wouldn’t be as much of a thrill and a challenge?

[S22] Um

[S21] I don’t know / [Laughter]

[S24] It seems like there’s such an emphasis on health concerns these days / that if that was legalized / and it was easy to obtain / that / so / there’d probably still be the thrill seekers who would go after the harder stuff 

[S22] Yea

[S21] Yea

[S24] But / I mean / if that’s available to them / um / not to say it’s / by any means healthy / but relatively / better for you / so

[S23] I kinda think less people would go to harder stuff / cause / like / they wouldn’t have to go to the street corners or whatever and / find the / dealer / and / be exposed / to like harder stuff

[S24] They just go to the drug store

[S22] I mean / does drinking make you want to smoke crack?

[S21] um

[S22] I think / no more than smoking pot would / you wouldn’t do coke or anything 

[S23] Right / [Laughter]

[S22] Yea

[S23] I don’t know / you always learn in health class that it’s a gateway drug or whatever

[S21] Right / right

[S23] But / I mean / I’ve / I know people here who do pot / and I’m pretty sure they don’t do like 

[Laughter]

[S22] Yea

[S21] A lot / a lot of my friends like / they do pot / and like / I know that they would never go near the other stuff

[S23] Right

[S21] So I really don’t / I don’t know / I don’t think that would be / that much of a problem

[S22] I mean / also

[S21] There’s always gonna be the people who do it [Laughter]

[S22] Yea

[S21] But / I mean / I don’t know

[S22] I learned in my high school health class that if you have sex before you get married you go straight to hell 

[Laughter]

[S23] Yea

[S22] And / I mean / it’s all about / like the epistemology / like / how do you get to the point that you accept something as fact / and what are you’re assumptions underneath it / ya know / [sigh] / that would be interesting

[Laughter]

[S22] Might modify American culture a little bit / I think a lot more people would buy video games and snack food

[Laughter]

[S23] Yea / the snack food industry

[S21] Grandma’s boy

[S22] Yea

[S24] Is it legal in Amsterdam? Does anybody know how that’s dealt with over there?

[S21] Um / cafés and stuff / [Laughter]

[S22] It’s regulated / but / it’s pretty much

[S22] Is there a tax on it? Do you know?

[S21] Is it regulated?

[S22] I’m sure / yea / well / I mean / it’s regulated like a liquor license 

[S21] Oh / right / right / right

[S22] And so are like / mushrooms / and prostitution  

[S21] Right / Yea

[S22] And pretty much everything else

[Laughter]

[S24] So I don’t understand how they can make something illegal in this country / that / when we have drugs like alcohol and cigarettes available to us that are clearly more dangerous 

[S23] Yea

[S24] And they don’t even know / problems with this / haven’t been able to prove anything yet / um / maybe there’s the fear of the unknown / they don’t really know at this point / but / it seems awkward to me 

[S22] But / I mean / but / from the standpoint of someone who’s been elected / like / you owe it to your constituents to keep them happy / so / if you think you’re gonna keep them happy by leading a moral crusade against / like penguins

[S21] Uh-huh

[S22] Then / you will lead a moral crusade against penguins / because you’re constituents will think you’re the man / ya know / and / that / that just seems like the same kinda like / random thing / just / people decided they were gonna lead a moral crusade against weed / but not alcohol / when / it could realistically / just as easily see alcohol being banned / as marijuana / for the exact same reasons

[S24] Well / do you see / I mean / cause clearly that was the case / decades ago 

[S22] Yea

[S24] And maybe up til not too long ago / do you see that changing?

[S22] What do you mean?

[S24] Cause this generation doesn’t seem to see the problem with it / we’re not really on a moral crusade against it

[S22] Against / marijuana?

[S24] Against marijuana / would you see that changing?

[S22] well / but / neither were our parents when they were our age / I mean / not all of our parents / but probably more of them than they would admit to us

[S24] I mean / you would probably see some of the older law makers against it / but / I mean / that generation is working its way out / and ours in / that doesn’t really / have a problem with it / and can’t find scientific data against it / at this point
[S22] But / but / there’s still a big / I mean / it’s very important to consider that there’s still / like / a big / thing / in our culture / like / it’s not a mature thing to do / like / once you’re out of college / you’re just / an asshole

[S21] It’s kinda like over with [Laughter]

[S22] Yea / once you’re out of college / it’s really frowned upon

[S21] You still do that? / [Laughter]

[S22] Oh / you still do that / yea / it’s like / you didn’t kick that already?

[Laughter]

[S22] And so / I guess that kind keeps it in a healthy balance on its own

[S21] Yea

[S22] Because like / and I / I still don’t / I don’t think that / that would go away / if it were legalized

[S21] Yea / I don’t think it would it / only because / you really / like / you just can’t [Laughter] / you / I don’t know / I don’t think you can

[S23] That’s true / that’s a really weird stigma

[S21] Yea

[S23] Cause it’s perfectly fine to drink / every weekend after college / but / yea

[S21] I don’t get it

[S22] Yea / I don’t think anyone does

[Laughter]

[S22] Well / I mean / obviously / if you smoke marijuana / you do things like shoot your friend in the face by accident / ya know/ wait / you guys didn’t see that commercial?

[Laughter]

[S24] I’ve seen it.

[S22] You’ve seen that commercial?

[S23] No / I’ve seen the one where / the kid runs over his little sister on her bike / on her birthday

[S21] Oh my G-d / that’s awful / [Laughter]

[S23] It’s so depressing

[S22] Yea / there was this commercial / where the kid’s like / I’m so high right now / and he picks up a gun and shoots his friend in the face

[S24] Harold and Kumar

[Laughter]

[S22] Harold and Kumar made fun of that

[Laughter]

[S22] They made fun of the commercial

[S23] All the time

[S22] Yea / it’s craziness / but I mean / there are still places where it’s illegal but it’s accepted

[S21] Right

[S22] Like Jamaica

[Laughter]

[S22] You have anymore questions?

[Well / do you guys want to talk a little more about / um / the effects of alcohol / and compare them to the effects of marijuana / if you think that’s a reason it should be legalize]

[S21] Um / I really don’t know [laughter] / like / the difference / I don’t know / I don’t know / I’m not really / like educated [laughter] / on the differences / that much
 
[S24] Yea / I don’t really know any of the scientific / differences / but just from experience seeing friends / who / would go out and drink for an evening / and those same friends would normally say / that if they were going to / have marijuana that evening / they wouldn’t drink / and it wouldn’t be anywhere nearly / the amount / or equivalent of alcohol / I just think / just the way people use it / it’s not / gonna be taken to that degree / people wouldn’t just like / binge marijuana smoke / if that makes sense

[S23] Yea

[S22] I mean / and / professors at this school have told me / on multiple / and / and / I / and professors at other schools / like / professors all over the place / like some of the smartest people we know / have told me that / like / in college / in their college experience / they sat around and smoked / and / intellectualized with their friends / like / they got very into the philosophical material they were learning / current events / about debates and all that thing / and / it / I don’t know / it / it’s just interesting / and I’ve seen a lot of that go on here / like I’ve seen kids who are in the same philosophy class / just smoke / and get in like / huge discussions / if their professors were there / they’d be like so happy that these kids were discussing the material outside of class / they’d like give them extra credit points / even though they’re high as shit [Laughter] like

[S21] I know / like one of the kids back home / like / um / he / supposedly took his SAT high and got a 1520

[S23] Wow

[S22] Yea

[S21] I mean / like I’ve heard other stories like that / but / I mean / I’m guessing / that / that only / that happens very rarely

[S24] You tend to see the same thing with alcohol though / maybe not on quite the intellectual high / but the ability to just open up / and talk / about

[S23] Yea

[S21] Yea / a lot more social

[Laughter]

[S22] Well / but / like / but at the same time / there’s something very very hypocritical about / if a kid has ADD / we prescribe / schedule 2 narcotics / to our four and five year olds / we give them / Ritalin / which if you’re caught with it on the street without a prescription / it’s a felony / if you have it in the right quantity / and we give it to kids / to make them / like easier to manage

[Laughter]

[S22] But at the same time / like / there’s something just very hypocritical about / I mean / even / even / just like / just like / Ritalin / and Adderall 

[S21] Oh G-D

[S22] Like / they’re / they are stimulants / that are very illegal to carry in one context / but encouraged in one / in another context / and actually / encouraged and sold by an industry which is very very very powerful and accounts for a big percentage of our economy

[S23] Uh-huh

[S22] Ya know / the pharmaceutical industry / I wonder what would happen if the pharmaceutical industry totally got behind the idea of medicinal marijuana / I wonder if that’s what it would take for it to all of a sudden be like / cool / ya know

[Laughter]

[S22] I don’t know [laughter]

[You guys have any thoughts about that / about what he just said]

[S24] I don’t know / they seem to subject matter expects / I would guess / them in the medical field / so / if you got them behind it / and / the doctors / PhDs 

[S21] I think if they made like / yea / if they made like / um / the effects / like / the long-term effects more clear / and like / I guess they weren’t as bad as everyone thought / and that’s why they legalized it / I’m sure they would definitely get behind it because they would make so much money off of it / I don’t know why they wouldn’t be behind it 

[S23] Right / well I think that’s what would need to happen for / marijuana to be legalized and accepted

[S21] Yea

[S23] Is someone to tell like the parents and the grandparents that / hey / this is ok / your daughter’s not going to shoot someone in the face or 

[Laughter]

[S24] Exactly / like the lawmakers looked / the decision makers looked to them

[S23] Right / as long as / if they put like / they put like limits on it / like medical limits / like this is how much you can consume without such an such effects / but it needs to be defined / I think

[S22] Well / but / the scientists who define that / there’s the FDA / who like / regulates / and then there’s the people in the pharmaceutical industry / so automatically / the people in the pharmaceutical industry have very big vested interest in the FDA / cause the FDA basically like / squeezes their wallet

[S23] Uh-huh

[S21] Right 

[S22] When it wants to / and so those are the scientists who are all working together / to do this / and so / if they’re the scientists who said that like / Ritalin is ok / and who said Adderall is ok / and who said Zoloft and Paxil are ok / Zoloff and Paxil do the exact same thing that ecstasy does / just / in a very very very small and controlled way / it’s the same chemical in your brain / serotonin / it’s the same thing that ecstasy does

[S21] Right / uh-huh

[S22] And / what’s even more / you can build up a tolerance to those drugs

[S21] Right

[S22] And the same thing / to the point where you have kids who are taking 15 to 20 milligrams a day / at the age of  7 / and this / and we’ve only been doing this for 10 or 15 years / so / down the road / like 

[S21] Uh –huh

[S22] I mean / we don’t even know what psychological effects we’re gonna have / and I think people should be equally as skeptical of that as they should be of weed

[S21] Right 

[You guys have any thoughts about that?]

[S24] It’s just the same argument for alcohol and cigarettes / I mean 

[S22] Yea

[S24] They’re causing the same problem / and that stuff’s legalized 

[S23] Yea / well / I think there has been / a big movement / like recently / to / more / research medications on your own and actually find out / side effects and stuff / because there’s been / so many bad drugs out there / like the heart one / that ended up killing a lot of people / and / causing permanent damage / and / I think people are becoming a lot more wary of the system / and / what the FDA says and the pharmaceutical companies / but / I mean / if marijuana’s been around / in / in big public usage / a lot longer than some of those drugs like Zoloft / then / I don’t / I don’t know why / Zoloft / would be / widely accepted / and used 

[Laughter]

[S23] And Ritalin / and stuff like that / and not marijuana

[S21] Yea 

[S22] They’re all drugs 

[You guys have any other thoughts on this topic? Ok. End of discussion]
