CATHOLIC CHURCH

[Is everyone ready to begin? Ok. In your opinion, does the Catholic Church need to change its ways to adapt to life in the 21st century? Who would like to begin?]

[S7] Ok [Laughter]

[Number 7? Ok]

[S7] Um / I guess I feel like / the Catholic Church does / cause I’m Episcopalian / so it’s like a / branched off / it’s like the same thing but / there’s a couple / like / variations to it / and / I feel like / they do / because the fact that / I feel like the bible and / the / like / many of the teachings / were based on like / it’s like simple black and white things / and / our 21st century / everything is just / I’m / I’m a grey person / there’s not a direct answer to everything except for some things / yes / but / everything mostly in my life right now is grey / like / I wanted / like / there’s yes but then there’s no / and so I’ll try out both things / and I feel like the Catholic Church doesn’t allow for that / they don’t allow for / different circumstances / they say no to abortion, no to homosexuality / no to this, no to that / and / that’s not allowing people to figure out things / and / ya know / ya know / change their ways / and / anything / because all they have is this strict yes and no / that’s not / hm / don’t like that

[S8] I mean / on one hand / I would say that I’d / I’d want them to change / I’d want them to start opening up and start accepting all these new possibilities

[S7] Yea

[S8] Because / I’d like them to adapt to it / but / at the same time/ I want to say no / I don’t / want / think they should be forced to do anything / I don’t think they should be forced to adapt / because / I mean / you have free exercise of religion / which / I / I pretty much believe in / anybody can / do what they want / like / in terms of religion / unless it’s like too obscene / but

[S7] Yea / [Inaudible]

[S8] You gotta draw a line somewhere / but / like if something / they’re not really causing that much harm to like anybody else outside of that / so

[S7] Uh-huh

[S8] I feel it’s up to them / because some of the issues / that they side no against / like gay marriage, abortion, and all of that / you can / you can do that in other religions / maybe not legally according to the government / but

[S7] Yea [Laughter]

[S8] There’s still a / I don’t know / in other religions they accept that

[S5] Yea / so then you don’t need to be Christian / right / like Catholic if you don’t want to accept it / anymore?

[S7] Yea / I mean / cause I feel like

[S5] What of Episcopalians / don’t / aren’t black and white?

[S7] They are black and white.

[S5] They are?

[S7] Yea / well / I don’t follow them

[S5] Either

[S7] Hm?

[S5] Either / oh is the Catholic Church / is Episcopalians under the Catholic Church?

[S7] Yea / it is cause there’s like / the Catholic Church has a pope and / there’s like / this whole Virgin Mary thing / and Episcopalians / don’t have a / everyone’s a Bishop / and / not / they don’t have a high person up there

[S5] Oh they don’t have a [inaudible]

[S7] And we don’t / we only talk about the Virgin Mary on / um / Christmas 

[S5] Oh.

[S7] And some other day / but / I’m not a big / I don’t do Episcopalian things / cause they don’t / they just really / like / their sermons / I feel like when you have a sermon or a homily it’s supposed to / touch everyone / and / their homilies are so dry and for an hour you can have a really good nap / during that sermon

[Laughter]

[S5] Do you consider yourself religious?

[S7] Uh-huh / very religious / I just don’t / I like / cause I went to Johns Hopkins / I’m in the Gospel Choir here / and I went to Johns Hopkins and they had this Gospel Jubilee / and / it was like a really big Baptist thing and everybody was just talking / and I was like / it actually / I’d never been spiritually moved and that was a time / I was like crying / because I had so much in my heart / and I was like / that was / that had me spiritually / moved / and I like / I realized a lot about G-d / like / during that time / but / I feel like with the / Catholic and Episcopalian things / it’s like / the / like here’s / here are you and here’s G-d up here / and / then when you’re a Baptist it’s like / kind of like this / and that’s how I view it / I feel like G-d is like a friend / and not so much as like this higher authority / he knows everything and that which makes it a little bit higher than you / but / he’s not so much as / to just be like this overbearing, dominant, domineering person

[S8] Yea / that’s one thing I think is a problem in the Catholic Church / they think of G-d / they’re all G-d fearing / um 

[S7] Yea

[S8] He’s / gonna unleash his wrath on you [Laughter] if you do something terribly wrong / like all of that / but then there’s those other religions that see him as this / just like / kind of a friend / as you were saying / which is

[S7] Yea / that’s how I think about it

[S8] I think it’s a better way to approach the entire situation / I mean like / if you’re gonna see him as the creator / I mean / he / obviously cares about you, loves you and all of that / and he wouldn’t really want to punish you / just for / simple things / he gave you your will / so / he expects you to break it

[S6] [Inaudible]

[S8] Oh / sorry.

[S6] It’s ok.

[S8] Go ahead

[S6] I think even the structure of the Catholic Church has become outdated and I think that’s one of the most important problems it’s facing right now / because it’s still kind of based on this paternalistic structure / and it still has that same hierarchy that’s been entrenched for / G-d knows how many centuries

[S7] Yea

[S6] Um / and I think that’s become a problem for it because it’s / because of that it’s very insolated / the hierarchy / and it’s no longer really responsive to even / like / the ideas and concerns of ordinary Catholics / like / a lot of American Catholics feel the same way you do

[S7] Yea

[S6] But they can’t do anything about it because it’s not like they have a vote or anybody besides / somebody who’s been to the seminary / has worked their way up through the ranks has a say

[S7] Yea

[S8] Yea / that / that / the problems with the Catholic Church date way back when / and they’re still / even going on today / I mean / if you take Martin Luther for an example / he / basically created the Protestant Church / and / with his / um / was it 95 theses

[S7] Theses

[S8] Theses / yea / he listed all his problems with the Catholic Church / like / taking indulgences and all of that

[S7] Uh-huh

[S8] And / some of those problems still go on / I mean / you still see corruption / you still see problems with / like / pedophilia and all of that in the Catholic Church and / it’s gotta stop somewhere / I mean

[S5] The thing is / there’s human nature though

[S8] Yea

[S6] That will go on anywhere / everywhere / not just the church

[S8] But / it’s a big of  human nature but I think it also has to do with the Catholic Church repressing like all the emotions that / humans would typically feel / and then it just kind of gives these people these like little outlets where they try to / express those feelings but it always ends up in someway that / is / wrong

[S7] Exactly / yes.

[Can you elaborate a little bit more on what you’re thinking?]

[S7] Because / I feel like they just / ok / I kind of forgot what you said that I said yes to / but / the whole / what did you say? It was like

[S8] Oh / the repression of that / like emotions and all of that

[S7] Yea / the repression of emotions / like / that’s / that’s what I was talking about / like / the Bible’s like / here’s this and here’s yes and here’s no / and then like / and / as like / especially as a teenager and as like a coming adult / there are so many things that you just / you’re questioning and you’re wondering / and then here you have the Bible is like / no / you can’t go out and smoke, you can’t go out and / just try and have a casual relationship with someone, you can’t go out and have sex, you can’t go out and do this / and it’s like / that’s the human emotion / to go out and to try and to do / and they’re like suppressing that and that’s why you have / probably Catholic priests / who’re doing the whole pedophile thing because they’re like / they’re so like / ya know / it’s so like refrained and like restricted from being a total human / because / they have to / I mean / unless of course / there are some people who are spiritually guided into it / ya know / and they’re spiritually / it’s spiritually there for them to feel all of this / and / ya know / do the whole celibate thing / go for it / but [Laughter]

[S6] At the beginning when they first / like / Catholic priests were not celibate to begin with / when the church was first founded / that was / a very pragmatic decision they made because priests started having children / bequeathing church lands to their children when they died / and that was causing / and that was causing / that was causing financial problems for the church so they instituted celibacy / and I mean / when you look at it kind of from that perspective / it wasn’t even really instituted as a spiritual thing to begin with 

[S7] True

[S6] So / why is it still around / so / it’s not like they couldn’t control that now if they wanted to

[S5] Good point.

[Did you have something to say before about how / um / he was saying it was human nature / you were saying it was human nature / to / um / the thing about pedophilia / and / you were making the point of maybe it’s just kind of a human thing to do that]

[S5] Um / I / it’s such a close room [Laughter] / um / I don’t know / I just feel bad for / that the Catholic Church will sometimes get a bad rap for stuff like that / when / it could happen anywhere with anyone / and / I / I don’t know / I just / I feel like they’ve just got / kind of / labeled as like / ya know / bad priests and everything / but 

[S8] I think almost in reality / because of what / actually happened / I think it’s just because it was like a clash of like the values / pretty much in the church

[S7] Yea / and I feel like if it was like / it didn’t / it wouldn’t have mattered if / like / cause if Episcopalians / you’re allowed to get / have / um / to be married / as a priest / and so / if it were to happen in that way / then they’d have been like / well ok / but because it’s a rule / and / because as a Catholic priest they say dedicate your whole life to Jesus / then / it’s like / that includes the sexuality part / so that’s why it’s like / it’s clashing / ya know / everyone’s like / ya know / Catholic’s / Catholic priests are these pedophiles because there’s a rule against it and I feel like if there wasn’t a rule / then / people wouldn’t care as much

[S5] So if there wasn’t a rule they wouldn’t care if they were pedophiles? Or?

[S7] They wouldn’t / it wouldn’t be / they would care if they were pedophiles / but / it wouldn’t be like this big Catholic priests are bad thing / and don’t get too close to Catholic priests type thing / if it / if there wasn’t like a big strict rule about / cause isn’t like Catholic / isn’t like Catholicism the only thing / the only religion that allows for priests not to be married / is that the only one?

[S6] No / there are a lot of eastern religions that advocate celibacy

[S7] Oh / ok / but I mean on / this side

[S8] Yea / I think it’s one of the few religions in America / I believe

[S7] Yea

[S6] Yea / I mean / and it’s not like you / there are a handful of married Catholic priests around the country and the way to do it is to become an Episcopalian priest first 

[S7] And then

[S6] Because the theologies are so similar and then decide to want to convert and they’ll let you keep your wife

[S7] [Laughter] Yea

[S5] Oh, really?

[S6] Yea

[S5] So Episcopalians can be married? 

[S7] Uh-huh

[S5] What are the other / religions / that you guys know?

[S7] There’s Evangelist / um / Baptist / and

[S8] Evangelical

[S7] Yea / what did I say?

[S8] Hm?

[S7] Did you say Evangelical?

[S8] Evangelical / yea 

[S7] Yea

[S6] There are a lot of small sects of Christianity / I mean / I don’t think we could list them all even if we were out here thinking about it for a while

[S7] Yea [Laughter]

[So what do you guys think of that? Of the / possibly getting married and then / becoming a Catholic priest after?]

[S6] If you really want to be a Catholic priest and you really want to get married / I guess that’s the way to go

[S5] I didn’t even know priests / I feel kind of stupid saying this / but I didn’t even know priests like under the Catholic religion could get married / I guess I just know what I know from my town, from my church, and that’s

[S6] It’s not very common at all / like / I said / it’s like

[S8] Yea / it’s very rare / I don’t think I’ve ever / I couldn’t give any examples of when it’s happened / but / I know it does happen

[S7] I think it’s wrong though

[S5] Makes me feel a little better [Laughter]

[S7] I think it’s wrong though cause it’s like you’re using another religion to get 

[S8] Yea / that’s

[S7] Like to better yourself / that’s wrong / ya know 

[S6] Well / I mean / the theologies are so similar though / like you said / it’s just a few minor differences here and there / like 

[S8] Like / I mean / I don’t think it’s really wrong if you / like / are raised in one / raised an Episcopalian / and then like / all of a sudden your eyes open up to Catholicism / and then you decide to convert and you’re already a married priest / but 

[S7] Yea

[S8] But / if you’re just using it for that purpose / I mean / it just / kind of adds to the whole / like / the problems that we were talking about before / like / the problems that arise in the church / and all of that

[S7] Yea

[Anything?]

[S5] I guess / to continue the pedophile / thing / um / did you / I’m not very clear on the whole situation / are any of you? On what happened / like / was there a cover-up or something / I just remember hearing different rumors / about

[S8] There were a couple of cases I think up around / in the New England area 
[S5] Uh-huh

[S8] Where priests were / like / I don’t know / like / I’m not sure how exactly they were caught / if they were like reported by the children themselves / or if / they were actually like walked in on / which would probably be really awkward [Laughter]

[S7] My elementary school had a case of / there was like / it opened in 1960 something / and my elementary school / like / um / had a couple / of pedophiles

[S5] A couple cases?

[S7] Uh-huh / I was / I was in eighth grade when I one day / [Laughter] / I’m like / and I looked / cause my teacher always got the paper / and then I saw / cause I went to a school called St. Columba / and it was like, St. Columba pedophiles / and I was like, Whoa [Laughter] / and I was like / and I had everyone reading it / and like / two minutes / it was fun / but I didn’t really figure out / like / the depth behind it because I was in eighth grade / so

[S5] Were you guys impacted at all by it?

[S7] No

[S6] I actually have an uncle who’s a Catholic Priest.

[S5] Do you?

[S6] Yea.

[S5] And what did he think?

[S6] He / obviously he wasn’t happy about it / but / um / he did get a lot negative reactions cause most priests wear around / like / the Roman collar and the black / all the time / when they’re out / like / going / even doing like shopping or stuff like that / and people would walk up to him and call him a pedophile

[S5] Oh / really?

[S6] And that just wasn’t the case / but / I mean / that’s the mindset people get just from the repeated news stories

[S8] Yea / go ahead / keep going

[S6] I mean / it really was an epidemic what was happening / it wasn’t like / this wasn’t something that was happening in the Catholic Church but it’s not all over the Catholic Church / ya know?

[S8] Yea / that’s point / one thing I want to point out / like / people have to learn to understand that it’s not the entire Catholic Church / like / the Catholic Church itself does not support that / but then you have these select cases in there which are causing the problems and kind of portraying this image among the entire population cause that’s what you’ll hear about for the next couple of weeks / I mean / and just the whole image of the Catholic Church is being tarnished by these couple of / I guess scoundrels / who I guess are going out there and doing these things / which is / I mean / one reason why you could say that the Catholic Church should change it’s ways / because / this image is getting out there / and it’s not what the Catholic Church stands for / so / they really should try to solve the problem before it even gets worse / and / I think with the day and age like / progressing and all of that / and all these new / like / I guess contagions coming out / there’s / only so much you can hold back

[S5] Do you think the church would / that would / stuff like that would change / if / um / priests were able to be married?

[S8] I think it / I think it would actually help it because / I mean / with a marriage you’re able to / more or less express yourself a lot more / rather than living in solitarily

[S5] But isn’t it / like / I don’t know / I’ve heard stories like / even on TV / like Special Victims Unit and all like those Law and Order shows [Laughter] / it’s like you’ll have married couples / married men who / have / like / that secret life and they’re pedophiles

[S7] But that’s like / that’s like the same thing we were talking about / it’s like a / ya know / just those cases / but I feel like / the alter boys or who they do the pedophiles with / is like / they’re there all the time / like / because / I know I used to be a acolyte / up at my church / and / they / I was there like every Saturday / I was there for Wednesdays for Gospel Choir / for like / rehearsals / I was there all the time / and / so / with that / it’s like / they see it all the time / and you have intimate / I mean / me and my priest used to sit down and just like talk / and / then sit down and discuss things that were going on in my life / and then / I was like the senior acolyte so I had to be there a lot more than anybody else had to do because I was a senior acolyte / I was the mistress of ceremonies / so / I had to like / see out the whole mass / so I was there a lot / so / it’s easy / if he had a wife / they wouldn’t have those urges / or / a wife / or anyone else they’d want do anything with

[S5] But they do / they do have those urges even though they have a wife

[S6] Well / I don’t know how / like just because you’re a pedophile doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re gay / it’s just an outlet for repressed sexuality essentially / and the priests don’t have anywhere to go to express their sexuality / and

[S8] Yea

[S6] I’m not saying that it wouldn’t be a problem at all anymore / but / I think that would be significantly reduced as a problem because the cases here about where like / a married couple / where the husband’s a pedophile / I think that’s slightly different from the type of pedophilia that was happening in the Catholic Church

[S8] Yea / I don’t think it’s so much of them actually being pedophiles / it’s more of the act itself / it’s an act of pedophilia / but I don’t think they’re actually pedophiles / I think it’s just that they have all this built up in them / they’ve been living in solitude for so long / I mean / how much longer can they hold it in / they get to the point [Laughter] / they get to the point where stuff like that happens / I mean / where as if they were to have a wife they’d have that / outlet / and it’d be a safe outlet / and / I mean / it wouldn’t be something that’s going to impact someone’s life forever / like / tarnish their life

[S6] I think the other problem with the pedophilia / that the / pedophilia epidemic exposed was that / because the Catholic Church is so insolated they’re having a real crisis in terms of getting new priests / and because of that / they don’t have people to staff the parishes / and / they want to keep the priests they have / so even if someone is a pedophile / you would see the archbishops and bishops would just move them from parish to parish whenever cases popped up instead of reporting them / and / I mean / that’s a big issue / and I think that they would be more likely to get new priests and / they would actually conceivably be able to fire old ones if they needed to / if they had new blood coming in

[S7] Yea

[S6] And I think that would be more likely to happen / if priests had the opportunity to get married / it would be more of an attractive prospective to a lot of people / a lot of people I know would be more likely to be priests if they could get married

[S5] It’d be an easy job

[S7] Yea / it wouldn’t be / I don’t know how they do that / [Laughter]

[What do you think? Do you guys agree with that?]

[S8] Yea / definitely

[S7] Yea / I do 

[S5] I agree but I don’t think it’s ever gonna happen

[S6] No

[S5] I don’t think it will ever change.

[S6] I think that because of the / the structure of the Catholic Church / they’re just a naturally conservative institution

[S8] Yea / it’s way too conservative

[S5] They’re set in their ways

[S7] And then like / changing that would mean / like / there’d be like a cascade / like changing that would mean changing something else / and changing something else / and / I mean / if it was something like really new it would be a lot easier / but / because Catholicism has been there for like

[S5] Forever

[S7] Yea / pretty much / ya know / it’ll be really hard to change that / and

[S8] And plus / you gotta think about it’s roots / I mean / it’s roots poke over across the seas / so / this / and that’s pretty much where / like / most of the Roman Catholic religion and all of that come from 

[S7] Yea

[S8] And it’s much more prominent over there / so / you have to think / if it doesn’t / they don’t really / I guess you couldn’t really say they don’t have the same problems that we have / but / they’re not really expressed as much / over there / as they are over here / and 

[S5] Why do you think that is?

[S8] I think it’s just because of / like / a difference in society / like / where we grow up / we grow up with all these like outside pressures and all of that / and / all of it just caves in

[S5] You don’t think it’s as pressured over? 

[S8] Hm?

[S5] You don’t think it’s as pressured / life is as pressured?

[S7] They don’t have as much media as we do

[S8] Yea / the media is a lot different / like

[S5] Europe we’re talking about?

[S7] Yea 

[S8] This is a very commercial society / so / even if you’re a priest you’re gonna be exposed to some of that / I mean / you can’t live your life / in just like / living in a house and not see any 

[S7] Yea

[S8] Not see any advertisements anywhere / or hear about anything

[S5] Did you guys ever hear / there’s a new / um / movie coming out with Dakota Fanning in it / but / you heard about that?

[S6] Yea

[S5] And they’re / did you hear?

[S6] The rape scene

[S5] There’s like a rape scene / and she’s like a little girl being raped by an older man / and there were a lot of people that were / protesting / to that / just because it gives you like a / like you were saying / like a visual

[S8] Yea

[S7] That’s scary

[S8] I mean / even in the context that it’s doing it / I mean / it’s still portraying this image / and / it’s still gonna be 

[S5] Like / the idea?

[S8] Yea

[S7] I think people are just scared of seeing / like / they said the same thing about Passion of the Christ / everybody had their big old uproar about / actually seeing / I mean / when I saw it / it like had me / I was like / oh my gosh / it’s nothing / nothing’s like / reading the Bible / and then actually seeing that

[S5] I wanted to go to church after I saw it [Laughter]

[S7] That was / oh / that movie was crazy / but / I just feel like 

[S5] Yea / intense

[S7] It’s harder / it’s easier for people to not say anything when they don’t see it / and / ya know / it’s / as soon as people see it they’re like / whoa / wait a minute / ya know 

[S5] What does your uncle think?

[S6] About?

[S5] Did he ever give you / into any insight as to why he thinks / does he want priests to get married?

[S6] He has a very liberal mindset as far as most priests go / and he’s been told my the bishop of our diocese to stay quiet several times / so / he tends to not express his opinions out loud about things like that

[S5] Oh / wow

[S7] Really? He shouldn’t have.

[S6] But / he’s / like / but there have been cases where he’s given communion to people who aren’t technically Catholic which you aren’t supposed to do / and things like that / and he’s administered certain sacraments to non-Catholics

[S7] Yea

[S6] So / he’s kind of riding a fence

[S8] How can you really tell if they’re Catholic or not when they come up for Communion?

[S6] Well / a lot of people will talk to / it’s happened a couple of times / at weddings and funerals and stuff like that / where like the family will talk to him before hand and say / hey / so and so isn’t Catholic, is it ok if they receive? And he’ll just / say yes

[S8] Oh / ok / I get you now / I thought you were just talking about mass / when they get in the line

[S6] I’m sure that that happens too

[Laughter]

[S5] No / not you [Laughter]

[S8] They don’t really say anything 

[S7] That’s what I was talking about / they shouldn’t have the suppress anything / ya know / I feel like church is about ministering / to everyone / and to / ya know / you shouldn’t / I feel like sometimes with like the whole Catholic thing / it’s like / if you’re not Catholic then like / no

[S6] Uh-huh

[S7] And that’s like / the part that’s / that’s why Catholics I think are put like on this side / and then you have everyone else / because / everyone else is like / well we accept you no matter what / ya know / you may not be the same religion / but / at least come and hear what we have to say / but Catholics are like / you can’t receive communion until you’re this age / you can’t do this until you’re this age / and it’s just too many rules / I’m not a big rule person

[S5] I don’t know / I kind of appreciate that structure

[S7] You do?

[S5] Sometimes / I do / I don’t know why

[S6] I think it works better for certain people

[S7] Yea

[S6] And for certain personality types / like / if that just doesn’t work for you personality / ya know?

[S7] Yea / I’m a rule bender / I don’t do rules [Laughter]

[S8] Yea / I grew up in the Catholic Church and / I just found it way too strict / so

[S5] What are you now? Are you anything? Or?

[S8] I’m not really anything now / I consider myself agnostic / but 

[S7] What does that mean?

[S5] Oh

[S8] Um / you don’t / you don’t believe but you don’t like disbelieve / you don’t just say like / there is no G-d / it’s not like full blown atheism or anything like that / it’s like / I’m still open to new religions and all of that / I’m still listening / trying to figure out just which way I want to go 

[S7] That’s cool / so you should be allowed to [inaudible]

[S5] And what are you?

[S6] Kind of at about the same place.

[S5] With / as him?

[S6] Uh-huh / kind of / I don’t really know / to be honest

[S7] You’re a Catholic?

[S5] Yea [Laughter]

[S7] I was like / yea / she is [Laughter]

[S6] I was raised in a very, very Catholic family 

[S8] So I was I

[S7] Yea / so was I

[S6] Like / we were strict Irish-Catholics growing up / I have an uncle who’s a priest / my dad is a principal of a Catholic grade school / so / it’s not like / and I was an alter boy until I was like / um / a junior in high school / so it’s not like I wasn’t exposed to it for a very long time

[S8] Yea / my grandparents go to church every Sunday / they used to have to go to the church when they were little kids everyday

[S6] Uh-huh

[S8] Because their parents were that strict about it

[S6] My grandmother used to go everyday up until she died

[S7] I’m really / I was like it was / really ironic for me / cause I went to / I’ve been in Catholic school since I was in kindergarten / and / but yet I’m Episcopalian / so / that’s why I’m like / I can see both sides of everything / I just / I’m not / I really / I was / I was at a point in time when I was in like eighth grade / and ninth grade I was like / ya know / what / why don’t I just be baptized Catholic / I’m there all the time / might as well be [Laughter] / and then / puberty hit and I was like / oh no [Laughter]

[S6] It’s easy to be religious when you’re about 13 or 14 

[S7] Yea / [Laughter] / it is really easy cause you don’t question anything / you’re like / they say this, they say this

[S8] You just accept it all for fact

[S7] Yea / and then you hit 16 and you’re like / wait a minute / what / I don’t think I think this

[S5] What did you guys start questioning? I’m just curious. 

[S7] Like / I don’t know / let me think about that

[S5] Ok / [Laughter]

[S8] Yea / that’s actually a tough question because when / I don’t know / it’s just kind of all in the back of your mind / when you’re / when you’re thinking about it to yourself / like when you’re thinking about why you want to do this or not / but then once you’re / once you’re out of it / you just kind of forget all of that / [Laughter] / forget what actually made you tick

[S7] Yea / I don’t know / I don’t even remember / I just / I was / I used to be really devout / I was like / ya know / no abortion / I think abortion is wrong I think there are so many other options to abortion / and then / I got / I had friends / and I was like / it is way too hard to just make a decision based on that / and based on / ya know / some people / like / I just took it like one day / I was like / ya know what / what would happen if I got raped? Would I sit there and just have the kid? And I was like / I don’t think I can / cause I’m a big / I’m a mother person / and so / I can’t like / not that I want to get pregnant now / but when I would get pregnant / it’s gonna be like the happiest experience of my life and I’m / I don’t feel like / if I have that baby / if I was with that baby for 9 months / I feel like I’m gonna get attached to it / and so / I would / like / I couldn’t even do / um / like an adoption / like / even if I got pregnant now / well / school’s gonna be done / cause I’ll go back at another time / cause / I couldn’t / I couldn’t watch my child go off with someone else / ya know / I don’t know / so I just kinda / after a while / I was like / I kinda heard other people’s opinions about abortion / and / I kinda / I would go in and be like no abortion, no abortion / and then people would be like / who are you to say that / and then and got / got into like / a lot of really in depth conversations and it kind of changed my views on it / so / that’s [inaudible]

[S8] I don’t really think you could say yes or no to like an issue like that / I mean 

[S7] Until you get into that situation

[S8] Yea

[What do you think about what she was just saying about that?]

[S5] Oh / about abortion?

[Do you agree? Disagree?]

[S5] Um / I / I think it’s so easy to say / like / no abortion / but then when you are in that specific situation / it really depends on each person / like / cause I know I’ve had friends who have / ya know / had the near mishap / like / their period comes a month late / and / just / they freak out about it / and / that question comes to mind and then when you kind of sit there / thinking about it / I actually have a good friend of mine who had an abortion / when she was in the 8th grade / so / at that point in time / I guess I / would understand it but I don’t know if I would ever be able to do it

[S7] Yea

[S5] I don’t / like / I / agree with / like / the whole rape thing / that’s just an awful thing

[S7] Yea

[S5] To think about it / and / you’re right about / like / you may not want to give up the baby / once you had it in you for 9 months / and / but then / but then would you be able to live with the baby

[S7] Yea

[S5] Cause / you know what half of / that came out of such an angry / such an awful type of thing
[S7] That other person

[S8] Yea / and I think it really depends on like the situation at hand / like / depending on your lifestyle / like / if you’re someone who / doesn’t have an income / like / isn’t really living off of anything / and all of that / and you don’t have the money to afford something like that / like having a / taking care of a child

[S5] Uh-huh / No / I agree with you

[S8] Like / it’s just a really tough situation to be in because you’re just stuck with that / I mean / I know someone back at home / she had her baby when I think she was maybe 15 or 16

[S5] Uh-huh

[S8] And she still has her but she’s fine / she has a job and everything / so she’s working it out / but there’s other people out there who wouldn’t be able to do that / and / who probably don’t have the resources to like / figure all of that out on their own / so / when they’re stuck in the situation / where do they go from there?

[S7] And abortions are so expensive / like / nowadays / you can’t just / well is / well is it expensive / or is it free?

[S8] I think it’s

[S5] It’s not free / is it free? No.

[S8] No / I think it’s somewhat expensive but it’s less expensive than taking care of a child for 

[S7] Pretty much

[S8] Yea

[S7] Cause I think I / cause I was just going on basis of like movies and stuff that I’ve seen / that it costs like 4 or 500 dollars / I was like

[S5] That’s what I thought / [inaudible]

[S7] But / I think I’d rather / but then that leads into people who know they can’t come up 500 dollars / and then they go off and they / throw themselves down a / like steps / and get a miscarriage

[S8] I think in an illegal abortion / which / is not safe

[S7] They go to someone’s house and they do it?

[S8] Yea / that’s terrible / but

[S7] Yea / I’m a bio major / that’s disgusting [Laughter]

[S8] I don’t even want to think about that one.

[S5] I don’t know / cause / like / I said I was Catholic / I guess / but then / like / what is your opinion on this / like / I say that that / but then I would consider / in like a situation like that / an abortion

[S7] You’re not a devout Catholic / well / you’re not like by the book Catholic

[S5] Well to say what / I feel like / yea

[S8] I think you can be both / I mean / if the Catholic Church were to open it’s / open it’s doors to new / like / new situations at hand / that could possibly spring up / but / if / you wouldn’t have that problem / because / I mean / if they were to just take a neutral stance on something like abortion / and let it up / leave it up to the followers / I mean / condone it / but / don’t like / pull this 

[S7] [Inaudible]

[S8] Yea / just 

[Laughter] 

[S8] See it as a sin / but not as / something terrible / that you’re gonna / burn for eternity in hell

[S7] Yea

[S5] Isn’t G-d supposed to forgive us?

[S8] Yea

[S7] Yea

[Laughter]

[S7] But I had like a discussion with that / like yesterday with my friend / who was like / I told him / he’s going through this thing where he just doesn’t / like / trying to find himself / and he’s trying to find himself but also be like / a devout Christian / I’m like / you gotta / let it go / ya know / kind of / find his / cause he’s like / he doesn’t want to go off and go smoking / he doesn’t want to go do this / I’m like / G-d will forgive you in the end / and he was like / well / you know / I don’t want to take advantage of that

[S5] Is against the religion / to go / to smoke?

[S7] I don’t know / I don’t really know that / I was like / I never really heard about that / I feel like / it’s something that’s wrong / ya know / I feel like it’s kind of like a sin cause you’re / in the end / I mean / as long as you’re not like a chain smoker / ya know / that it kind of hurts your body in a way / but / do what you want / it’s your body / but

[S5] I understand the whole like / when you sin / we’re supposed to be sinning / like / at least when we have sex

[S7] Yea

[S5] Cause it’s supposed to be a sacred act / and you’re supposed to / produce / and that’s what sex is supposed to be / I just never thought about smoking as / a sin

[S8] I don’t know / there’s some places that I think / they’d consider it a sin / I mean / I live near Lancaster, Pennsylvania

[S5] Like cigarettes or like weed / stuff like?

[S8] Well both / I would say  

[S5] Both / ok

[S7] Yea / [inaudible]

[S8] In taking anything like that / I mean 

[S5] Ok / any substance

[S8] Like / yea / I live near Lancaster, Pennsylvania / and that’s / near Amish Country and when / there’s like a restaurant that I go to down there / and they always these little pamphlets in there / it always has / like / why you should quit smoking and then it goes all into this / explanation about why G-d doesn’t you to smoke / and all of that / and 

[S7] I feel like they make some of those things up / just to give you something

[S5] [Laughter] What were some the reasons why G-d / did you read it? Or you just

[S8] No / I just / [Laughter] I skimmed over them / some of them were kind of funny though / I mean / just some of the stuff you’ll see in there / like / they talk about like parties and stuff and why you shouldn’t go to parties

[S5] [Laughter]

[S8] I wish we could change that

[S7] They’re not condoning any type of fun in your life

[S8] Yea / why you should live in a farm without any electricity

[Laughter]

[S8] Pretty much / not to diss that / or anything

[S7] No deodorant or cleanliness

[S8] I mean / but / I couldn’t do that

[S7] Yea / but I think it’s cool how the Amish they like / have that time in which you turn 16 and you’re able to go out / but then it’s like a big culture shock / cause you’re like / I’ve know / like / I saw / there was like an Amish show where they like came out / and / they kind of did everything / and

[S8] I think I saw that

[S7] Yea / some of them had the choice to go back and some of them didn’t / and like / some of them chose to stay there / and I was like / you can’t / do that / for like 6 weeks and be like / well / what’s your decision / ya know / like / America / and what we do now

[S5] They only had 6 weeks?

[S7] I don’t even know if it was 6 weeks / but / it was like a 6 week show [Laughter]

[S5] Oh / ok.

[S7] So / that’s like / I just don’t feel like / you can’t / you go to Amish country / where you have no / all you do is go to church and you go to school / and you knit

[S8] And when you grow up with that / I mean / that kind of becomes your lifestyle / when you go out into the open you’re not gonna be used to that / you’re gonna be uncomfortable / therefore you’re not gonna enjoy as much

[S7] Yea / so / [inaudible]

[So / just to bring it back to Catholic Church for a minute]

[S7] Sorry / [Laughter] 

[Um / just to kind of sum up / do you want to have / say a little something / kind of / just sum up your thoughts on it / on the issue / or we can go around]

[S5]  I almost forgot what we were talking about

[S7] Yea

[Yea / it kind of went off topic]

[S8] I was trying to keep it somewhat on topic / I mean / trying to reel people back

[S7] Sorry
	
[S5] I remember you bringing it back a few times [Laughter]/ Thank you

[S6] Um / I don’t know / I think / yes / the Catholic Church does need to change if they intend to survive / long-term / but I don’t know that they will 

[S5] Ok / yea / I don’t think they will

[S7] I don’t really

[S5] I could see where you guys come from on some different points / but / yea / I just don’t think we will

[S7] Yea / cause I don’t know

[S5] I feel like it’s effortless / like you shouldn’t even try to / bother almost / I hate to say that

[S7] Bother to what? Change it?

[S5] Yea / to try to change it / cause we can’t really / you were right / like / you said / you have to be / up in the hierarchy to actually make a change / and

[S8] Yea

[S5] We / we definitely can’t [Laughter] 

[S7] Yea

[S8] Yea / I pretty much agree with him / that they / should change / I mean / it’s definitely / part of their survival to change / but / I don’t / no / I don’t think they will / I mean / it’s really / tough process to actually change the Catholic Church considering how large it is / and / how it’s all across the ocean / it’s that huge hierarchy

[S7] Sorry / and I feel like the / um / the / like / I just don’t think they will / change at that point because / they / it’ll be / like / I feel like they have this stance / like / if we / like / outlast it / and we / ya know / stick to what we say and all that type of stuff / then maybe we’ll end up winning in the end / but / it’s kind of hard because if you think about this generation / this generation is like an accepting generation / or a tolerating generation / and / we’re more people that we’re like / yes to / ya know / we may not like it but we’re not gonna diss you on it / we’re not gonna kill you off of / well / there’s some people / but

[Laughter]

[S8] Most of us / ain’t gonna kill nobody off of it / so / I feel like / with / if they don’t change it / this new generation that’s coming in with the new things we’re accepting, with the new things that we’re doing / they’re gonna lost this new generation

[S5] That’s a good point.

[Ok. Any other thoughts? Ok. End of interview]
