GAY MARRIAGE

[Ok. You guys are all ready? Alright. While some states have legalized gay marriage, others are still opposed to it. Do you think either side is right or wrong and why? And / who would like to begin?]

[S21] Ok / [Laughter] / um / I / personally / am / fine with it / um / but / like / we had this discussion before / I feel like / the term that they use / is / not right / like marriage / is not right / like if it was / like / how / I think they use like civil union / or / whatever / or / I don’t even care / but / I feel like / marriage is like a sacrament / and / it should be kept as a sacrament / just / so / just change the name / but / yea / other than that / I think it’s fine

[S24] Yea / I would agree / at the state level / government / not / not bringing religion into this at all / that / it should be some sort of / a new legal term / civil union

[S21] Yea

[S24] Definitely / should be allowed / um / on the religious level / it’s certainly a different / um / issue

[S23] I think / that would help the separation of church and state / I don’t see anything wrong with / um / making a new / name for marriage / as long as it like you said / applies to all marriages / heterosexual and homosexual / and / has the same rights / conferred with it / as a marriage license

[S22] Well / um / considering that / ya know / people’s religions views might effect / how they think about it / but it’s also only a portion of the population / what do you guys think is the / um /  relationship between / church and state should be in this situation

[S24] Completely separate / I mean / we’re living in a country where there’s at least three major religions

[S21] Yea / I don’t think / I think it should be non-existent

[S24] Um / to have any one represented in legislation

[S22] But then

[S24] Go ahead

[S22] But should people be / allowed to use religious reasoning when they’re arguing / for / or against gay marriage

[S24] You’re free to argue however you wish / but / I think / as far as putting it into our / United States legal system / I don’t think that’s a / stable argument

[S23] Yea

[S21] Like as / yea / like / making it legal in a state / or per state / I don’t think religion should matter / and / I mean / I guess / per couple / like / it / that’s their deal / but making it legal / I guess / I don’t see any problem with that

[S23] Yea / I don’t think it should be / able to be argued as a religious matter / in a political arena / like in / campaign platforms or whatever / politicians shouldn’t be / allowed to use a religious argument

[S22] But people just use it cause / it’s a marketing tool / like / in / um / in Pennsylvania / like / Rick Santorum / made it a big / big staple of his platform and he got elected for a term in the Senate / just cause / I mean / I guess it was important to his constituency / um / and they thought that way / but / I don’t know / it just kind of blurs the line between the two / in a way

[S24] Yea / I think it could work in certain segments of the country / like you said / just as merely a marketing ploy / to / get yourself into office or whatever position / just cause you know

[S21] Right

[S24] That’s what the people you are serving want / or that is their particular view / but / I mean / I’m / I’m not sure / but I think on a country-wide basis / that wouldn’t exactly work going into / a presidential position

[S22] Well do you guys feel that to grant / um / gay couples / the legal rights that come with marriage just in terms of filing for taxes and cosigning mortgages and visiting each other in the hospital and adopting kids and things like that / do you think that to grant them / a / an institution while although not called marriage / in eyes of the law is viewed equal to marriage / do you think that that would infringe upon / say / Catholic social teaching / or / any of the other popular religious / views

[S21] Maybe / I guess it / would / but / still just / the name of it / like it shouldn’t / like / if it’s not gonna be called marriage it should have absolutely nothing to do with the church unless the couple’s Catholic and they want to make it an issue / and I don’t / I don’t understand why they would even bring it into it

[S24] Do any of you outside of / um / making this a religious argument / honestly have a credible argument against it / what are like some of the opposing views?

[S23] I have no idea / all I’ve heard is / the religious argument / where a man and man / yea

[S24] So you must be bringing religion into it / yet / I wonder if you went to those same people and you asked them / if they wanted some sort of theocracy

[S23] Yea

[S24] They would agree with it

[Laughter]

[S22] Well / people argue against it on / on religious grounds / but even if / even if people don’t overtly argue against it / on a religious grounds / I think a lot of people argue against it because they say / oh well / the fabric of society will come apart / and then / ya know / people are gonna start marrying animals [Laughter] and then it’s just gonna break down / our whole future and all that / but / it might all stem from a religious / an essentially an originally religious argument

[S23] I think it really does / cause / I mean / that’s / that’s where science comes in / is doing studies of like / homosexual versus heterosexual couples / and the way they function / in neighborhoods and in raising children / and / so far / I mean / from what I’ve seen / no significant difference has been found at all / I mean / there’s dysfunctional couples on both sides / and there’s couples who are gonna get divorced and / abuse their children / but / statistically / you have the same chances / either way

[S21] Uh-huh

[S22] I think most of the gay couples who do want to get married just want to do it / like I was saying / for more of a legal status rather than for the idea of it / like / so they can do things like cosign on a mortgage / buy a house

[S21] Yea

[S23] Right / cause they’re already living together / most of the time so

[S22] Yea

[S21] I think they just want to be recognized / as any married couple would

[S23] Right / and I mean / they should be / they should be able to get like tax breaks if they’re gonna be living together anyhow / and like functioning as a / family

[S22] Yea / or at least / get / get the privileges that married couples do / even if they don’t get / ya know / communion / or / whatever

[S21] Right / I think it’ll be / like / voting for it / or anything like that / I think it’ll get easier as like / like / years down the road / cause like / people right now are like / the / main people who are voting for this right now are like / ya know / like middle aged / older people / who were raised like / to know that / homosexual couples were bad / and homosexuality is horrible / and / a lot of other stuff / we’re kind of growing up with it / and we’re seeing it as it’s normal / so / I think years down the road it won’t be / as big of a problem

[S23] That’s true.
[S24] Yea / I think it’s the same idea / slavery coming outta that

[S21] Yea

[S24] And then women’s rights that we talked about last time / just gotta work it’s way out / doesn’t happen over night / when you’re trying to change / the belief system of the whole generation

[S21] Yea

[S24] It’s just not / gonna happen

[S22] But still / I mean / say / say / hypothetically if a politician represented an area that was like / a very / like / say / Utah / it’s / that’s a very / I mean / I’m not trying to stereotype / but / there’s a lot of Mormons in Utah

[S21] Uh-huh

[S22] A lot / a lot of very faith based communities in Utah / so you do think / that then / Politicians from Utah / would be warranted using a religious argument / even if it was in political forum? like against gay marriage

[S21] Um

[S23] They shouldn’t / but I’m sure they will

[S21] Yea / [Laughter]

[S23] If they’re just trying to get the vote

[S24] I’m sure they will / but I don’t think that makes it right necessarily

[S23] And / it’s just / it’s an easy appeal to people’s emotions / to bring religion into voting

[S24] Yea / and you would hope that the voters would have the right sense of mind not to bring the religious aspect into that / that’s not what it’s all about

[S23] Yea / but I mean / that’s what gets them out in mass

[S24] Right

[S23] That’s what makes people vote / is something challenging / like / a belief system / or / something they disagree with

[S22] Or it might not be what makes them vote / but it might be what / ends up turning them into

[S24] Sways their vote

[S22] A single issue voter

[S23] Uh-huh

[S22] Where they’re voting because / of abortion / or because of gay marriage / as opposed to because of the whole picture

[S23] Yea

[S22] But / um / then / it’s / how about for another question / if it is gonna be going on a state by state basis and judges in state supreme courts are gonna be the ones who are gonna be like / passing laws / ya know / allowing / ya know / a particular / city / or judges in a particular city will say ok / well we can do it in this city / um / how do you feel about that? If they’re going against the grain / of / what’s allowed in most other places / like / do you think that / that / the judges / like a judge somewhere should be allowed to decide / just cause / that / that’s a big argument that comes up / against gay marriages / oh / well these activist judges / shouldn’t be allowed to be deciding this

[S23] Uh-huh / I think there needs to be / some / sort / of / wider consensus on it / cause then with that / you have the issue of / people getting married in one place and it not being legally recognized / like if they move to another city

[S21] Yea / I know / yea / what’s the point

[S23] So / right

[S24] And it would take forever to spread throughout the whole country

[S23] Yea.

[S22] It’s gonna be a hell of a court case

[Laughter]

[S23] Yea / but I mean / at this point / it could go one way or the other / right now / cause / there’s / Bush has already got his amendment up there / he’s trying to pass / banning gay marriage

[S22] That’s not gonna happen

[S23] Yea / I know / still / I mean 

[S24] What’s / what’s his basis for that / does anybody know?

[S23] Religion / [Laughter] / sin

[S21] [Inaudible] [Laughter]

[S22] His basis for that is / he believes that marriage should be between a man and woman / end of story

[S23] That’s / that’s 

[S22] End of story / and / but / but he’s just putting that in as a symbol though / cause he knows it’s not gonna make it through

[S23] No

[S22] He doesn’t control either house anymore / like / he knows it’s not gonna make it through / he’s just putting it up there to make all the people who voted for him because of that / happy

[S23] He still had a lot of support / I mean / I don’t think something like that would ever happen / but / I think / if / the Supreme Court accepted this issue right now / it would be / I don’t know / a lot of people would be unhappy either way 

[S21] Yea

[S22] But then you get into / questions about / who has the right to make the decision / whether it should be state by state / like the Supreme Court probably wouldn’t want to take it on / because / they / they might think that it was unconstitutional for them to legislate on something like that / and even if Congress took it on / I’m sure someone would challenge it up to the Supreme Court saying it was unconstitutional / It should be a state by state thing.  Then either way / even if like one state allowed gay marriages / I don’t know / I’m just thinking legally / could turn into a big fight / everyone’s just kinda putting it off

[S23] Yea [Laughter] / pretty much

[S22] Do you think that / um / gay couples bringing up children is detrimental to the children?

[S23] No

[S21] I don’t either.

[S24] No / I guess obviously it’s gonna be different then / um / ya know / a female and a male / but / it doesn’t mean that it’s wrong necessarily / not detrimental

[S23] Yea / I think the only thing detrimental is / to them is / how / other people might view them / like as a family

[S21] Uh-huh

[S23] And how what they might encounter growing up / but 

[S21] It’s nothing they won’t see in the future anyway

[S23] Right / if they have a secure home life

[S24] Right / again / that’s something that’s gonna have to work its way out in generations from now anyway

[S23] Right

[S22] I’m glad we all agree on this but I guess it doesn’t make for [Laughter] a very interesting conversation / um 

[S21] Someone play devil’s advocate.

[S24] Maybe / I’m stealing away from one of the other questions / cause we’re probably going to get to the church soon / but / does anybody necessarily agree with any of the church’s stance / on / gay marriage

[S22] That’s what I’m trying to do

[S21] I guess I see where they’re coming from / but / I don’t know / I don’t know 

[S22] Well / the church’s stance / at least now / what it’s been whittled down to / on / homosexuals having sex / is that / it’s not / immoral / except for in the sense that / it’s not for the purpose or procreation

[S21] Right

[S23] Right 

[S22] And so they say that procreation is the only justification for sexual activity / so / they say that’s bad

[S21] So

[S24] The way I’ve understood it / is that that lifestyle was presented to them as a chance to sin / and that they’re supposed to / um / work against it their whole life / as sort of / repenting / I mean / that’s the way I understood in my theology class / [inaudible]

[S22] It depends which / which priest would /would / it depends which priest’s rant you read because there are / a lot / or / like which theologians book you read / but

[S23] That’s true [Laughter]

[S24] I read / um / something in the Episcopalian Church right now / I don’t know if anyone saw / one of the priests / um / came / or Bishop rather / up in Boston I think / um / came out / as saying he was gay / and it was kind of causing some tension between / the Episcopalian Churches here in United States and Europe / anybody hear anything about that?

[S23] Wow

[S21] No

[S22] No / that’s pretty crazy / G-d wars

[S21] Some tension [Laughter]

[S22] Yea / seriously

[S23] So wait / is it / according to the / Catholic Church / is it ok to be homosexual / as long as you don’t act on it?

[S22] I know a Jesuit priest who’s openly gay

[S23] Ok

[S22] But he was totally celibate

[S23] Well / yea

[S24] I even know they have counseling to / try and make you become straight

[S23] Yea

[S21] Change you back

[S22] Like that South Park episode

[S23] Oh man

[S22] Yea

[S21] Yea

[S22] You are very confused

[Laughter]

[S22] Well do you think homosexuality is a choice or a genetic thing?

[S21] Genetic I think

[S24] I see that they’ve found the / strand of DNA that’s accountable for it / I mean / I’m not a science major or anything / I can’t understand it / but

[S23] Yea

[S21] Yea / I still think it’s a little bit of both

[S23] Yea / right

[S21] I mean / if you have it / you have it / but / I guess if / you can like / I guess act on it / I guess 

[S23] I mean / I’m sure some people who have like the gene for it or whatever / because of their home life and their childhood / grow up never expressing it

[S21] Yea

[S23] And not even / like / considering it

[S22] Right

[S23] Just

[S21] Right / yea

[S23] I don’t know

[S21] That’s weird

[S22] Well we don’t talk about it / but / in Ancient Greece they were all about it

[S21] Yea?

[S23] Yea / [Laughter]

[S22] It / it was their thing / it was like / did you guys see the / um / the movie / with Brad Pitt

[S23] Oh / Troy?

[S22] Troy / yea / um / his / his cousin in the movie is actually like / his / his man-bitch [Laughter] in / in the story / it’s like / his lover

[S23] Yea / didn’t like

[S22] It was like a boy who was younger than he was / and in the movie it’s like / oh cousin / how I have missed you / and my roommate called it out / he was like / um / no

[Laughter]

[S23] Thank you Brad Pitt 

[S22] I mean / yea / that just points to like the fact that homosexuality is just so taboo 

[S23] Yea

[S21] That people are just / it makes people uncomfortable / it makes some people uncomfortable

[Laughter]

[S23] Didn’t they used to like only have sex with women when they wanted children?

[S22] I don’t know

[S23] And in Rome / the men were like for pleasure

[S24] Yep / that’s how I understood it

[S23] Yea

[S21] Oh / really?

[S23] Yea / [Laughter]

[S21] I never heard that before.

[S23] Really?

[S24]  Yea / the women were more of like the / house servants

[S23] Yea

[S24] Taking care of the property / [Laughter] / and when it was time to have children / but then / as far as pleasure and personal relationships / it was men

[S21] I never heard that before / Oh my G-d

[S23] Yea / which makes sense / living in a patriarchal society / like that / I guess

[S21] Oh my G-d / this is so strange

[Laughter]

[S22] That’s just kinda strange [Laughter]

[S21] That’s nuts / I’ve never heard that before

[S22] Craziness

[Laughter]

[S21] It’s all coming together now 

[S22] What / like mythology class?

[Laughter]

[S22] Well that explains it

[S23] Things have changed a lot

[S22] So / gay marriage 

[Laughter]

[Do you want to talk more about the adoption thing?]

[S21] Um / I think it’s good / I think / I mean / with / if no one else was gonna adopt them and they’d just grow in an orphanage / and / I mean / that’s / they might as well have a family / so / if they’re willing to do that / that’s / I think that’s really good 

[S23] What / what do people think happens to these kids that are adopted by gay families / do they think they’re brainwashed into becoming gay? Or like / abused and not allowed to play with Barbies / or

[S24] I guess they just think there’s a certain maternal aspect that you’re not getting / I mean / I’m not

[S23] Yea / but 

[S22] Or paternal depending on what’s going on

[S21] Or paternal

[S24] Of course you’re not gonna / well / yea

[S23] But I mean / there’s homes with single mothers and single fathers too

[S21] Exactly

[S23] There’s just

[S21] Exactly

[S23] I don’t know

[S24] It’s just that it’s just / it’s clearly gonna be different though if you have a mother and father 

[S23] Yea / I mean

[S24] But who’s to say that it’s wrong?

[S23] Right

[S21] Yea / I mean / has anyone seen that / um / it was an MTV episode / True Life: I have Gay Parents / it was really good / they turned out normal / they go to college / end of story 

[Laughter]

[S23] Good news / good news

[S22] That’s pretty crazy

[Do you want to talk more about the implications of the / amendment banning gay marriages / [inaudible]]

[S22] Amendment banning gay marriage

[S21] Man / that’s a bad idea

[S22] Does the federal government have the right to do that?

[S21] No

[S23] No / [Laughter]

[S22] Be / because / I mean / I’m not / I’m not asking that in like / oh / a let’s start a revolution kinda way / I’m asking that in like the way legal community is gonna look at it / whoa / hold on / can they really do that

[S23] No / they really don’t

[S22] And some lawyer / who really wants to just get his name in the news / and thinks he can do a good stab at it / if / if congress stepped in / they would try and take it to the Supreme Court / I don’t know / if it would just get shot down in district court or whatever / but / there would be an appeal / going on / and then it would be up to the Supreme Court / but / um / apparently if George Bush is just gonna keep on appointing conservative judges [Laughter] then maybe it’ll hold / then would that be hijacking the political system of religious ends?

[S23] Oh my G-d yes / what / what / like / I mean / I think we’ve already determined that there’s no / legitimate reason / that somewhere doesn’t base itself in like religion / I mean / a lot of things base themselves in religion / our morals and stuff / are based on religion / but most things / I mean / you can defend in other ways / like / oh / it’s bad to kill people / more than just it’s a sin

[S21] Right

[S23] I mean / it disrupts society / it / harms families / and all that

[S22] What about / this argument from psychologists / that / boys need male role models and girls need female role models / in order to mature properly / which would be an implication / for boys in female gay couple households and girls in male gay couple households

[S23] Right / I’m sure / I’m sure they do / but

[S21] They should also have to talk

[S24] But what constitutes developing properly / I mean

[S21] They should also have to talk to single moms / and / single dads

[S23] Right / I mean / there’s role models outside of the household / a teacher can be a role model

[S21] Yea / friend and / yea / right

[S23] Yea / friends / parents of friends

[S22] [Inaudible] / exactly

[Laughter]]

[S23] I mean / it’s not like the only things in the world they’ll ever experience is / inside the home

[S21] Yea / home life / yea

[S23] I mean / they’ll know that other people grew up differently / and / meet other people

[Laughter]

[Do you have anything else from that show that you saw?]

[S21] Not really / just / there was a girl / who had / two male / ya know / parents / and then a boy who had / like / two female parents / and / the / one / the boy / he / his father was like a sperm donor / and it was really strange how they did that / really strange / like / one / it was almost like / like / well / only his / I guess only / he was related to one of the / one of his moms / I guess you would say / and it was just really awkward how they like / portrayed that / I feel like / cause then like / they / his mom like married this other lady and like / I don’t know / I guess it’s awkward for me because / again / bringing religion into it / it’s just / strange / I think 

[S23] Did they keep in touch with the father at all?

[S22] Yea / did he have a relationship with his father?

[S21] Um / he had / that was pretty much the show was about / he met him / like when he was / I think 19 / like / they got in touch or something / and / I didn’t really see what happened after that / but / um / I don’t know / I just thought it was weird how he had like / two moms / and she had two dads that just / that’s just awkward / I don’t know / I don’t know / but I still don’t see anything wrong with it

[S23] I’m sure if you grew up with it, it wouldn’t be awkward.

[S21] Oh yea / no

[Laughter]

[S22] And if it existed all over the place / it might not be awkward too.

[S23] Yea

[S22] So yea / gay marriage

[S23] About that

[Anything else?]

[S22] How about in-vitro fertilization? You guys opposed to that? Where the fertilization happens outside and then the fertilized egg is planted inside to grow

[S23] Um / not really / I mean / I think it’s / um / I don’t know / it’s not something I would look very favorably on / as an option / because of like / the chances of getting multiples / and stuff like that / and then having to like / keep the / the other eggs frozen for a long period of time just in case / there’s just a lot of / stuff going on

[S21] That’s too weird for me / [Laughter]

[S22] Well / they / they do a lot of that / like / there’s / there’s ladies in India who take like thousands of dollars just to carry pregnancies / the egg’s not theirs / the sperms not there / they didn’t actually have sex

[S23] Right

[S21] Yea

[S22] It just / they like / and then / the same couples who do that will pay like twenty-five, thirty thousand dollars / it / to find like / to find like an egg donor who has SAT scores above this

[S21] Right

[S22] And has all these / and goes to an Ivy League school / and does like all this stuff / like / I took summer classes at an Ivy League school and there were like / there were like / egg donor /advertisements around for like girls to make like $20,000 or something like that

[S23] Woo

[S22] To take all of these like hormones / and / all this stuff / and then somehow / big needle / I don’t know

[Laughter]

[S22] It was crazy / it was really weird

[S23] That / oh man / that’s silly

[S22] And then just ship the baby to India where the baby can be had / and then / ship the baby back / or something

[S23] [Laughter] / The baby factory

[S22] Yea

[S23] [Inaudible]

[S21] That’s really weird / that’s too weird

[S23] Oh my gosh / that’s such genetic profiling

[S21] That’s so weird

[S22] Yea / yea

[S23] Oh my gosh / I didn’t realize that was happening

[S22] Genetic profiling / that’s a whole other question / genetic engineering, genetic profiling / selective breeding

[S23] Oh / that’s scary / I don’t think that’s

[S22] So / in vitro fertilization / yay or nay

[S23] Well

[S24] What other options are there / for the couple if they can’t have a child of their own

[S23] Adoption

[S24] I mean / maybe / but / with / with / um / in vitro fertilization / one of the / parents can / pass on the genes to their child / correct?

[S22] Yea

[S24] Adoption / not at all

[S23] Yea / sometimes hold / if the problems not like

[S21] I’d bring religion into that again / like / I mean / I don’t know / that’s just weird I think

[S22] I think if I were that child I’d have quite the / quite the little identity crisis going on

[S21] Right?

[S22] I’d be like / so wait / who’s my mom? Who’s my biological mom? Is it the lady that carried me or the lady whose egg I came from / and neither of those are you / so / bye / like

[Laughter]

[S23] Oh my gosh / cases like that / where your egg comes from Harvard

[Laughter]

[S22] Yea

[S23] And you’re born in India / oh / oh man

[S22] I mean / I know who kids who say that they / I mean / I know kids who are just like / who are just like / crazy sometimes / and they just say they have like / big / like / a lot of psychological issues come from the fact that they were adopted / and that’s just from adoption

[S23] Yea

[S24] I’ve heard that.

[S23] I / I think that’s / um / that  / um / surrogate motherhood is a little / with the / with the / even with the genetic profiling / it’s still a little better than / that / um / the movement that’s going on now / to like tell if your baby has / like / a lower IQ / and stuff / in the womb / and what people are doing with that information / like / now there’s people who are / like having abortions because / they know that there children aren’t going to be that smart

[S21] Yea / like my / my roommates mom / she was told that / like her younger brother / um / there was like / I think it was / like an 80% chance that he would have downs syndrome

[S23] Uh-huh

[S21] And / she had to decide if she wanted to abort it or not abort it / and she had him / and he’s perfectly fine / and / I mean / an 80% chance

[S23] Yea

[S21] That’s / that’s pretty high / like / you’re telling these people this

[S23] Yea

[S21] And it’s / a really hard decision [Laughter]

[S22] I mean / it seems totally logical to / I mean / cause / cause / abortion is one issue and gay marriage is another issue / and / this genetic like / selective genetic testing thing / and abortion or whatnot is another issue / so / it / I mean / it / it makes a lot of sense to draw the line and say that / that / ya know / selecting whether or not you’re gonna have an abortion based on genetic factors before you ever know the kid / that seems immoral / but / but / at the same time / at least in my opinion / like there are instances in which an abortion might / I don’t want to use the word justify / but / in which people do have very strong convincing reasons why they don’t want to have that child / like / they can’t offer the child a good life / something like that / but / it would take so / it’s just so not feasible / that society / and that / like / the lawmakers / would ever arrive at / at a line like that / or a compromise like that / when they’re all just / kinda bitching at either other to / to get press attention for issues like this

[S23] Uh-huh

[S21] And / and like / when / when they’re proposing bills they know aren’t gonna pass just cause they wanna get in the newspapers saying they proposed the bill

[S23] Yea / that’s true / it’s gonna be all or nothing / isn’t it?

[S22] I guess

[S23] You can’t really divide / and issue like that 

[S22] Yea / which is / which kinda sucks / it does

[S23] But / I mean / how do you control people’s motives too

[S22] Exactly / you can’t

[S23] We should just / yea / I mean / I’d say they should outlaw / genetic testing / like in the womb / but then / I mean / if you are gonna have a child with downs syndrome / I guess it would be better to know and be prepared

[S21] Uh-huh

[S23] I don’t know how you would not allow people to do anything with that information though

[S22] Genetic testing for downs syndrome / or for like autism

[S23] Yea

[S22] Is / is more common / but what about / like / if you’re gonna open it up to that / then are you also gonna be able to open it up to genetic testing for like hair color / eye color / stuff like that?

[S23] Right / that’s the thing

[S24] It’s hard to draw a line

[S23] And how do you stop that

[S22] Yea / and the people who / are / are / like / I don’t know / I think the people who are doing that / they should / they’re not ready to be parents

[S21] Yea

[S22] Like / they shouldn’t be parents cause they’re not ready to deal with a kid / and they’re not ready to love their kid / or / they are / but conditionally

[S23] Yea

[Laughter]

[S23] What are you gonna do if your kids born with brown hair and you wanted like a blonde haired blue-eyed baby / are you gonna dye it from the age they’re three months?

[Laughter]

[S22] You’re gonna not love them / are you gonna like send them to a concentration camp or something?

[S23] Right

[S22] Like / that / that’s just

[S23] An option

[S22] You can’t do that / no

[S23] It’s no good

[Whistling]

[Alright. I’ll stop here.]
