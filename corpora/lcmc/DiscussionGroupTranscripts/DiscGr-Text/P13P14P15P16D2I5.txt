IRAQ WAR
[You guys ready to start again? Ok. Um / the controversial war in Iraq has made news headlines almost everyday since it began.  How do you guys feel about the war? Did you just call that? Anyone want to start?]

[S14] I feel like / I feel like it’s a little late to be debating the war in Iraq.  Like / even like Republican congressmen are like / oops
[Laughter]
[S14] um / I don’t know / if were debating this like 2003 / when / ya know / it’s actually almost / as / ya know / yesterday / four years ago that we entered / so 

[S13] Wow

[S15] I didn’t know that. That’s crazy

[S14] March 20th / was that yesterday / I don’t know

[S13] 22nd

[S15] Yea / yesterday was the 21st.

[S14] but / I don’t feel like it’s a good topic to debate now.

[S16] but / I don’t know / like / if you don’t / like / the president / basically went into the war based on lies or false information as they call it / but like / they had Colin Powell go on television and point to like these little dots and say that they were like bomb factories / they had no idea and they found nothing once they got there / and they / they probably didn’t move it / or some people say / cause like / we were surveillance-ing the whole time / but like / if the whole war is based on that / it’s not really / like you can’t really do anything about it now / but / you just have to like prevent it from happening again / like people will probably make the same mistake again / just like / just like Vietnam / and / like politicians will always have some kind of / they / they see the president as like an authority figure and they’ll listen to what he says / if he says it / and they don’t really question it too much / and / I don’t know / it just gets you into trouble sometimes 

[S13] I think like / after September 11th / we had to do / like something / but / we went into Afghanistan / and I think that would have been strange and / on / like the part of the nation if we just let ourselves be attacked without trying to at least do something / to / find / like Osama Bin Laden / but then / the war in Iraq is like a completely different / like thing so 

[S16] yea

[S13] then like / what you were just saying about how like / ya know / thinking that / there were like the / um / weapons of mass destruction/ and like / it was kind of like / I feel like Bush used the fact that we were like already at war to then kind of transition into a different war / when really / it was not necessary
[S16] cause like even today / if you ask some people / which I have done / if you say like / why do you / like if people are standing up for the war still / if you ask them / sometimes they’ll say / like / what about 9-11 / and I’m just like / it had nothing to do with it

[S15] Yea
[S13] Yea

[S16] it’s a different type of Muslim anyway / it had nothing to do with Osama Bin Laden / Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein actually like / don’t like each other at all

[S15] No / it’s true / they like hate each other

[S16] they don’t agree with each other’s religions at all / and / we just / he just had a personal vendetta / I’m talking about Bush / I don’t know why exactly he did it / but / there wasn’t a good reason for it / like / he just used 9-11 as an excuse cause / just scared everybody / he said like / he doesn’t want it to happen again

[S15]  right / yea

[S14] I mean / I guess I got a little speech
[Laughter]
[S14] like the war in Afghanistan / obviously / President Bush didn’t care about Osama Bin Laden / I mean / people in the Bid Laden family / living in Saudi Arabia / ya know / are part / global partners with businesses in America / that Bush is being supported by / we sent less / we sent less troops into Afghanistan than / the / police troops in Manhattan / they actually had Osama Bin Laden / like / they knew where he was / in like what cave they were / then we withdrew and gave the power to capture him to the Afghanistan government / and / he’s still alive / well / I don’t know if he’s still alive / but / he’s certainly not captured

[S13] I thought they executed him / didn’t they?

[S15] no / that was Saddam 

[S13] oh / no / never mind / I lied / forget that / sorry

[S14] no / I mean / he might be dead now / but not / ya know / he wasn’t captured by anyone / he was just died in the caves or something / um / I also / I feel / why we went into / um / Iraq / I mean / I feel it’s pretty like / I mean / not like obvious / but like once you think about it / I mean / Bush’s father / during his presidency there was the whole Gulf War crisis and these things never got resolved / and / ya know / his father didn’t get a second term and stuff kinda just like petered out / ya know / Saddam tried to kill his dad so / um / that’s / ya know / a personal vendetta

[S16] yea but then his dad actually said that / he didn’t / he didn’t go into war in Iraq because they couldn’t think of an exit strategy / but then his son just went ahead and did it with no strategy at all
[Laughter]
[S14] [inaudible]
[S16] he just did it on a whim / just / I don’t know / I don’t 

[S14] something else / I just recently read / um / right after 9-11 / um / well they found / they recently found notes from um / some of Ashcroft’s / um / aides / like who / like taking notes of stuff he said / like / I would do that all the time / and / like some of his notes for 9-11/ hours after it happened was like / like / use this to things not related / like / relate this to Iraq / like / as soon as 9-11 happened / like

[S16] I definitely believe that.

[S13] I think we’re just like in a huge mess right now [laughter] cause if we pull out now then / we’re just gonna like leave the place worse than when we went into it / because they have / they’re just learning about governmental systems / and like / everything’s new to them / and if we pull out now it would kinda be like Russia pulling out Afghanistan and leaving like ruins / but we need to get out / I mean / it’s stupid that we’re there still / and sending people / and more people over / and / I just feel like / working on an exit strategy / I don’t feel like they’re working on an exit strategy.

[S15] yea / like you were saying before about / um / like we went in without an exit strategy and like what you said about how it’s pointless to debate it / the fact that we’re there now / but what do you guys think about / how should we end it / like / we are there

[S16] I have no idea. It’s really not a general question
[Laughter]
[S16] I don’t know / like / yea / if / if you just want to talk about like how it shouldn’t have gotten started / it’s like a / a completely other issue

[S14] Jump on the bandwagon.

[S15] yea / I feel like by now / what you were saying / even / most people now are against it / at least I feel like that

[S13] yea / I agree 

[S16] it took them a while though / like / I don’t understand how after Bush starts a war he gets elected again / when we realize that / I guess people didn’t know it was like a mess over there / I don’t know / I think it honestly would have been better off if we had just left Saddam cause he wasn’t a threat to us at all / he had nothing to do with us / and / we’re not supposed to be like / it’s not our job to just like police the world / and / that’s not why we went there / they’re just saying that / I don’t know / that’s how I feel / like I feel like they’re just full of lies right now and / they based the whole thing on lies / and / for him to get elected again was just like / it just like baffled me / I don’t know / I don’t understand / I think it was Kerry’s fault though too / but 

[S13] I just don’t think either one of them were good.

[S16] Yea / Kerry might not have been the greatest guy
[S13] I think we need new people

[S14] [inaudible] the selection

[S13] Everyone’s fresh right / in this new election / for the most part?

[S14] well / I mean / on the Democratic side / yea / some / the / Republicans / one of the four runners right now is McCain who ran 2000 / but / he’s / I mean / he’s fresh in the sense that his opinions aren’t / like they’re more liberal / um / and / yea / I guess I don’t want to jump on the bandwagon of like what all the critics have been saying about Iraq / but / um / like / North Korea / why aren’t we doing anything about that 
[S13] Yea
[S14] before Iraq where we didn’t even know if they had / any / like / weapons at all

[S13] and you would think that if like / I totally blanked out on the name / but / the national / the United Nations
[laughter]
[S13] whoa / that took too long / um / you would think if like none of them are supporting us that be kind of a key like / maybe it’s not such a good idea

[S14] I think / uh / I know / just a political / uh / cartoon that I remember from a couple years back / uh / you remember the whole mission accomplished thing?

[S16] yea / on the boat.

[S14] yea / I just remember / a political cartoon that was like / um / no actually it was a bumper sticker / it was a bumper sticker that said / uh / quagmire accomplished / and like / that’s exactly what’s happened / and / ya know / we still have half the troops there / that we went in there with / over there / and if we pullout now / not only is their government going to completely fall apart / but / they all hate us / so / we’re gonna be worse off / and the terrorism is going to increase like where it was before / like it just doesn’t make sense / this whole war doesn’t make sense 

[S16] yea / like / I / I think that a lot of people in America who don’t / who agreed with the war / like they don’t really think of the soldiers who are over there dying / like there’s actually American citizens dying / and they / they just / like / you could say they signed up for that / but / they didn’t sign up to like have their president lead them into a war for no reason / like / they / that’s just / there shouldn’t be people dying  / like / that’s the only / that’s the reason I could think for now / wanting to pullout / just completely / just to save more / lives / but / we might leave them in shambles but like / I don’t know / we can’t think of anything else to do / 

[S13] like we need to just / finally / actually / start / cleaning up after ourselves / and doing it really really slowly and giving them like more power themselves / a little bit at a time / and like / I know that’s like what he says he’s doing / but I don’t feel like he’s doing that right now

[S14] Yea / I mean / if you look at the people that they sent to clean up / and there’s a [inaudible] in the scandal / and / you know / all the like / government / all the businesses that were like / going to help / redo Iraq / were like / all friends with the Bush administration / like / someone’s definitely profiting off of this war

[S13] This is going back to the whole Busy or Kerry thing / um / I read this article / it wasn’t an article / I think it was a transcription of some sort of like a message that / um / Osama Bin Laden broadcast over Al-Jazeer / maybe like during the presidential elections / I’m not a hundred percent sure / but / it was really interesting / it was about / how / even though / Bush / would be / like / not that Kerry’s ideas would coincide at all with / like / the / um / Islamic fundamentalist ideas / but / more so / than like the conservatives / but like actually / in terms of the election / that / Al-Qaeda  would probably rather have had Bush reelected because / the whole / like point / what they want with the terrorism and everything is for / like / our / us as a nation to just like fail and to get into debt and to like / they just want to see us not succeed / um / and / like / Bush is helping us [laughter] not do that / so / I don’t know / when I was reading that / that was like / it was interesting cause I would have thought they would / prefer Kerry / but / it’s really not that they’re trying to reach any agreement with us / that they just / want to see us fail

[S16] Makes sense / yea 

[S14] I was gonna say something / oh / I think I was just gonna comment on how / I think it’s funny how like / with / how / like / everything is falling apart / this administration / is in shambles / um / so many people had to resign because of political pressures / I mean / I mean / nobody agrees with the Iraq anymore / I mean / there’s a whole / ya know / there was the Mark Foley scandal awhile ago / now there’s / um / there was like the scandal where they like lost / 8 million dollars / like / somehow / [laughter] / and they don’t know what happened to it / and / now recently / like the / um / the / um / attorneys who were getting fired because of / um / not / like refusing to / um / investigate / like liberals under the requirements sent under the Bush administration / and now just like / nobody supports what’s like happening anymore / and it / I mean / it’s just gonna lead to like / it’s already led to a more democratic congress and now / most probably a democratic president / so 

[S13] yea / it was interesting to see on the news / there was something / maybe a couple of months ago when Bush announced that he was going to be sending over like 20,000 more troops / they had / in a room / it was like / split up evenly of people that / supported the war in Iraq and people who didn’t / and they had some sort of a little / meter that they were rating / like as they were listening / to what he was saying / like if they agree with it / if they didn’t agree with it / and like / for the most part / whatever he was talking about / it was like kinda split / you could see / obviously like / the people who supported and the people who were against it / it was different / but then as soon as he mentioned that / um / he was gonna be sending over more troops / like / both sides / like / went way down / and like / yea / I just figure that we’ve come to the point where / hardly anyone supports it / and / like what does that say about a nation where no one / like / or the President is doing what is like / opposite of what he majority of the people are saying / and it’s supposed to be democracy

[S16] I think like the people are the only ones you can blame though / like / I don’t know / like / cause electing him the first time / sure we didn’t know about / like / that 9-11 was gonna happen / but then the second time / like / we kinda knew / like he wasn’t doing a good job [laughter] / I / yea / and then there’s Kerry though / but like / I don’t know / just to get a change / I think Kerry should have / I think people should have voted for Kerry / just to have some kind of change / cause like / what Bush was doing just wasn’t working / and it’s still not working / and / a lot of people still don’t see that / and 

[S13] I just don’t feel like any of them could have done it / I just don’t really feel like either of them / are capable / of the job

[S16] But a different president definitely wouldn’t have / gotten us involved in the first place / I think 

[S13] We were already involved.

[S15] Yea / we were already there

[S16] No no no / yea / the second election yea / we were already involved / yea / but I mean like / the first time / he made the mistake / like / we should have known that he was / that he’s not making good decisions / and 

[S15] I think by then though we didn’t realize that / cause like / it all happened / like so much / so fast / that no one really saw the huge big picture / like we weren’t given / like the public / we weren’t given like all the information that we have now / so like / we didn’t know about any of this

[S13] Yea / I think if / what we’re all agreeing on is that / most people are not in support of it / but / I think that at the time of the election / it wasn’t quite as clear cut as that / and also / I think / I mean just what I’ve heard some people say / um / that / ya know / he got us into this mess / he needs to be the one to get us out / or like / he needs to finish what he started / like I heard that / from some people / 

[S16] Yea / well / it’s not too smart
[laughter]

[S14] yea / I mean / one of the main / I mean / I’m not gonna say one of the major reasons cause people really didn’t know / but / um / one of the reasons he got elected was that / like / the change of administration / in like / the middle of a war / is like / it’s just not really a good idea / um 

[S13] that’s true

[S14] But / ya know / I still wanted him out [laughter] 

[So do you guys feel like the war has gone on long enough?]

[Laughter] Yea

[What else can we say about that?] 

[S14] um / I found something interesting online that was like a / projected like / cost of the war / where they had all these elements / like / little like / you could change / like / if you thought the war was gonna last til 2015 / or 

[Laughter]
[S13] Oh my G-d

[S14] and like / number of Americans you thought were gonna die / and they have it like preset to like / what / I don’t know / I’m not sure exactly who determined / how long they think it’s going to last or whatever / but / it’s like already preset to that [laughter] 

[S13] That’s really sad.

[S14] uh-huh

[S16] Probably people like gambling on it now

[Laughter]

[S13] I mean / I definitely think it’s gone on long enough / but at the same time / I mean / like you said before / you’re not a general / you don’t know what we should do / I don’t know what we should do either / about like how to end it / because / we can’t just / like / pick everything up and leave / like they’re / it’s like / too chaotic / but / then at the same time / we / I don’t think we should be sending more troops over there / because / we need to / be like / slowly / like / backing off so they can start to do more themselves / it’s / I think it’s just a big mess / I don’t know / what else to say about what we should be doing

[S14] I think a big part of Bush’s exit strategy was / um / like / let someone else figure out how to end it

[Laughter]

[S14] um 

[S13] we need to like educate people on exit strategies / and then / have them go into a room and decide on the best thing / cause 

[S16] yea / we just need / like a good mind / like a good / war mind / like something

[S15] so wait / are you saying that / like let somebody else figure it out / like meaning once he leaves office / the next person will figure it out?

[S16] yea

[S13] I feel like that’s probably what he’s gonna do

[S14] Well

[S13] I don’t see it ending before the election

[laughter]

[S15] No.

[S14] He’s probably not going to withdraw / this year

[S13] No.

[S16] If I / if I was in charge / I would / I would want to pull out / like / completely / just like right away / like / I don’t know 

[S13] That would leave everything in shambles. 

[S15] Yea / you can’t do that.

[S13] That would make other countries hate us even more / like / say / the people who 

[S16] I don’t think they like us too much / as it is though / [Laughter]

[S13] I know / but / we don’t need to add / like worse to it

[S15] but that would not help our cause

[S16] We don’t really have a cause though / like [laughter] / I don’t know / there’s no point in being there / so like 

[S13] well / I mean like / that would not help / our nation / we would make more enemies by just / yanking ourselves out of there / then like all the enemies we have on top of 

[S15] Yea / like so many countries / didn’t agree with us going in the first place / and they were like / ya know / you don’t know how you’re going to get out of there / you shouldn’t do this without the United Nations permission / so then if we / we already disobeyed them / and like / ya know / went completely against / what they were suggesting / so then like / we / like / did all this / made a huge mess / and so now we’re just like / oh / you were right / we shouldn’t have been here / and / up / we’re just gonna leave now / like / you can’t do that [laughter]

[S13] yea / and like / then that leaves that country so susceptible to everything / and / just taking / more like terrorists would like take over the country / and like / it would not be good for anyone

[S16] But if we don’t have a plan though to do anything / unless we come up with some kind of plan / I think we should pull out / 

[S13] But I mean / ok / think of it this way / if you’re living there / and like / basically you’re whole governmental system is gone / you basically have no soldiers / and this other country is like /taking over you / and then they all of a sudden just like leave / you have nothing / aren’t you going to be a little mad that they’re not fixing what they started / and / the next person who comes in is like / let’s go check / blah blah blah / cause they created this huge mess / you’re gonna be like / let’s do this / that would not be a good situation if we just left.

[S15] there’s so / so many different like / different sects and different groups over there that / if we just left / like / who knows who’s going to come to power / I just think that would be a really bad situation / as bad of a situation as we’re in right now / I think that it would be worst if we did that 

[S13] Yea / we need to just slowly back out / and have them / gain the power / as a country / themselves / so they can govern themselves

[S16] I think we just need to 
[Laughter]
[S16] I think we should just be more isolationist / completely / and just like / not / not to say like / not to / like not so much that we don’t try to help other countries / but / starting a war is not really helping / like starting that war / didn’t really help anyone / starting any wars don’t really / ya / just basically results in people dying / and I mean / if / if we / if we just / if that’s our goal / like I don’t know / it’s pretty bad / like we should just / I think we should just keep to ourselves / and / maybe like / if we could / make / like not be in so much debt from the war / and / stuff surrounding it / it / we would be able to have more money to give to other countries to help them out / I think they would rather have money than have us go in / and start killing people 

[S14] I mean / um / you mentioned like isolationist policy / and / ya know / before Bush we did / have / a strong 

[S16] economy

[S14] yea / and like a strong / isolationist policy

[S16] Yea

[S14] it was only like / broken / by like little things that we had to like / go fix / little Bosnia-Serbia / in Clinton’s administration

[S16] Yea

[S14] Of course / like years earlier / the world wars / but / um / yea / something / I’m not sure if I agree with the pulling out completely / but / um / talking about like the allies / that we would lose if we pulled out / like

[S13] We’ve already lost them

[S14] Um / yea / we don’t / most of the world already hates us / and the countries that are our allies / are either just our allies because we’re such a rich country / and / we have / we can destroy them if we wanted to / or / like / or ya know / countries like England / where / ya know / Tony Blair’s head is so far up Bush’s ass [laughter] it doesn’t matter what we do / so um / I mean / I don’t think that’s particularly a good argument / for staying in there / but / I still think we should

[S13] I don’t know / I don’t think we have many allies / and like / I agree with you / in like the allies sense / we’ve made a ton of enemies / but / we just need to let / Afghanistan / work for themselves / is what I’m trying to say / well / I mean / that’s not what I’m saying [laughter] sorry / wrong country / 

[S16] Iraq

[Laughter]

[S13] Whoa / anyways / so yea / Iraq / we need to have Iraq work for themselves / and / be able to govern themselves / without us being there 

[S16] I don’t / I honestly don’t think there’s any hope for them / like / they don’t want to change / I don’t think they want to change / I don’t know how / how bad it was there when Saddam was there / but / I cant imagine it being much worse than now / like so if we just left right now / um / I think it would just be / if we already went against the United Nations in starting the war / then like / we obviously don’t care at all what they have to say / so like / if they’re against us pulling out / it doesn’t matter / it really hasn’t affected anyone that much / like here / maybe / it might affect them / but like / us staying there / it’s kind of wasteful I think

[Ok do you guys have any other thoughts? Alright / End of discussion.]
