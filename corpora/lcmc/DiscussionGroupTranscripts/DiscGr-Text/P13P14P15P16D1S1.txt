GENDER/SEX DISCRIMINATION
[Do you feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the present day United States? And if so, what can we do to change this?]
[Who would like to begin?]
[Have anything to say about this?]
[Laughter]

[S14] well / I don’t know / I feel like we should open it up first to the ladies
[Laughter]
[S14] Do you feel discriminated against?

[S15] uh / I don’t think it’s as big of a problem as it was in the past. Um / I do feel that it’s unfair that females get paid less salary than males do for many of the jobs / even if they’re the same jobs / and / there’s also sometimes defective like / big glass ceiling / where like women can only like rise so far in the work field / and then / they can’t get passed that because people don’t look at them as / I guess / as certified even though they might even have more credentials than males are / those are probably the two main issues I have 

[S13] Yea / I pretty much completely agree with that / I was gonna use the same example of the glass ceiling / like you can look up and see people above you / but you just can’t get there / and / I think that it just / it doesn’t make sense to me how two people / a male and a female are doing / performing the exact same duties that the male should get paid more / but like / it’s / studies have shown that that does happen

[S16] um / I think Hilary Clinton actually running for president could be like a sign of change cause that’s like the highest position / and um / she’s pretty much ahead in the polls or whatever now / I don’t know / might be changing nowadays

[S14] I feel like / I mean Hilary is a step / but / right now she’s not gonna win / she’s not gonna come close / they’re going to elect a black guy before they elect a woman / so / um / I don’t know / it’s kinda hard to debate this because / I mean / no one is really for gender discrimination 
[Laughter]
[S14] but um / I don’t know / I feel like it really is changing right now / so / um / there’s almost in some places / we’re coming up with this kind of reverse discrimination / where / um / more money go towards like female sports teams or whatnot in order to / uh / feel like / they’re like overcompensating for discriminating in the past / it’s this entirely new issue coming 

[S13] If I can go back to what you were saying about / um / Hilary Clinton and a female president / I think that / besides the fact that I don’t think that she would win / um / I don’t even know if the world would be ready for us to have a female president / I mean / if you think like / the Arab nations where there’s so much more discrimination against women / I mean / I don’t know if our country would be / like / if other countries would respect a female president the way they would respect a male

[S16] I don’t know if they’re too happy now with our president though

[S13] Laughter / I Agree

[S16] Um/ I don’t know / I think she has a pretty solid chance actually / at winning / like it’s / it’s either her / of course Obama is up there / she’s at least number one or two / right now / for the Democrats / and that’s / that’s a pretty big step right there / there hasn’t been one in a while even running

[S13] There actually like was / one person / I don’t know here name

[S16] Not in like / it was like a few elections ago

[S13] She like died recently 

[S16] Oh.

[S13] She was like / she was actually a black woman to / and a lot of people liked her / I don’t know remember what [inaudible] / I don’t know / I guess / I don’t know what I was going to say
[Laughter]

[S14] Something else that comes to mind when I think of Hilary though is that / uh / ya know / how is she coming to power? Well it was because she was married to Bill / ya know / a man who was president / so / I mean / it’s a step but it’s still only a little step

[S16] Yea / but the president now too / like the main reason he was known was because of his father and like / but / um / I don’t think that / I don’t know if that’s the only reason / because she got elected as Senator of New York where she’s not even from / and like / she pretty much did that on her own / and uh / that she most likely did that thinking that she would run for president in the future / so like now she’s just taking the next step

[S14] I’m not doubting her ability to do anything

[S16] Yea

[S14] I was just commentating on how she / kind of gained the ability 

[S16] Yea 

[Come on, any points you guys can make?]

[S15] I guess I kind of agree with what you’re saying like / a lot of the times / I guess not even just with women / but it’s like for anyone / it’s always the connections that you know / and I guess I’m kinda turning this politically / but / I would like to see it more clean / where you can just like / rise up to the top of it / without any ties / but that’s kind of off topic / sorry
[Laughter]

[S14] Something I did want to mention / someone before said something about the world wasn’t ready for a female president / I don’t really feel like it’s the entire world / I mean / look at countries in Europe and elsewhere / and ya know / females have equal power / I mean / the leaders of their countries have been women before / like several times / and / I feel like it’s just America / I mean not just America / but / America is behind other countries / in / uh / equal rights for women /  I don’t know you. You can go.

[S15] I agree with that / like / cause there’s like / Queen Elizabeth / and then of past and now there’s like Queen Elizabeth now / and / everyone like / holds her in such high esteem / that / I don’t think / like / Europe as a whole would have a problem with a woman president / I think they’d probably actually think it was / very refreshing since we’ve had such a long trend of only males / and only white / and only upper class / and / um / I don’t know. I just / and in the Middle East / what you were saying / that’s like a whole different culture / so / you can’t really compare different cultures in that regard / but / I guess they could like accept our choice and we could accept theirs / even if we don’t agree / and 

[S14] I’m actually taking a class on Islam / and / like / really like Americans cant like /  imagine / like this is an entirely different culture / and like the women / like / we’ve been sending people over there to try to make equal rights / but / half of the women don’t even feel like they’re being discriminated against / they feel like this is how / the way things are the way things should be so / and / like how they have to wear coverings all over their body and / all that / I mean / they feel it’s kind of empowering actually / so / 

[So what do you guys feel about that?]

[S15] Um / well / I wouldn’t think that that would be very empowering / but / again / I mean / I’m not from that culture / but / I don’t know that you could really generalize and say that like all the women feel that that’s empowering 

[S16] Well / I said like half the women / I wasn’t making a generalization about it / so 

[S15] Yea / Yea

[S13] I agree with that / I don’t know / it’s like harder for us to comprehend / just because we have so different culture-wise / but / I guess if / we studied as to why they feel it’s empowering / then it’s easier to understand / and / also / you just have to look at their climate / cause I’m sure like the origins of it had to do with like the winds in the summer
[Laughter]
[S16] Um / but like going back to like the original like / how / if it’s like an issue now here / um / like / if you look at colleges even / like this school is seventy percent girls or something / or like sixty-five / and most like of the top schools now are like over fifty percent female populations / a lot of them are / so like / I don’t know if you could / say that males have an edge in that / which is like / that / that’s a pretty big issue like / they don’t really have an edge in that / so like / I don’t know

[S15] It would be interesting to see like / in a few years / because of / the / new trend in colleges / with more females graduating / [inaudible] the workforce 

[S13] Yea, I would think that that’d be interesting because I guess / part of the reason we have this whole glass ceiling is because historically businesses were dominated by men / and it’s just / ya know / relatively recently / like I don’t know / however / um / past couple of decades that women are starting to / take on more leadership roles / that / ya know / it’s gonna take time to balance that out

[S14]  There’s still only so many like management positions / like / the CEO of the company / there’s only one / I mean / there may be more girls in college / as long as there are guys / there’s still / like / a really good chance the guy will get the higher opportunities / so 

[S15] Um / one thing with that / like / you could think that if / as long as there’s some sort of a discrimination that exists / it / it might even almost make more sense for that top person to be male because if there’s going to be like males below / like if that top person was a female and then the males below her would be resentful of that fact that like / it might almost just be easier for the company to just / put a male up there / that way / I don’t know / like I just know / like I have / one of my friends / her dad / her dad’s boss is female and like / anytime I’m over there like he’s always talking about that / like how he hates that / and so / if that puts like an upset in the company then / I don’t know

[S14] Something else you have to wonder about / like I’m not saying I’m on a certain side of this / but like / whether private companies should have to worry about something like this / I mean it’s the same question / like racially too / like / just for like a weird example / um / like Baskin Robbins only hires girls / I think 

[S15] Really?

[S14] Well the one / at least the ones where I live do
[Laughter]
[S14] like is that discrimination or is / I don’t know

[S16] Well it could be just like a trend or something / like / since like / since it started out with all girls working there / or if it started out with all guys no girls would really want to work there / they would just look for another job / and it would just end up staying like men / all the time

[S16] Cause I saw that in / at my old job / cause like / I worked at CVS / and in the pharmacy it was all girls and all the other CVS’s near me knew it as Venus / they called it Venus cause like it was just a female only pharmacy and / um / they would / they would just have men like guys just come in and like / um / apply to work there / and pretty much turn them down right away / like they / they just saw that they were male / like all the girls in the back would just look / and like say it was a male / and just not hire them

[So do you feel that men are discriminated against in the workplace or otherwise?]
 
[S16] Um / women probably are more / but it might be just a trend that started out with men / like the whole foundation and then / women just didn’t feel like they belonged there

[S14] I think it’s really hard to achieve absolute equality between males and females.  Um / and / like / even at a time when like females might like / gain more power than men / ya know / I don’t know / it’s kinda hard to phrase what I feel like.  Someone is always going to have more power.  You can’t really avoid discrimination.  It’s / ya know / humans are humans

[S13] I agree with that/ [Inaudible]

[So what do you think we could do to change it?

[S13] I think that we just kinda said / I don’t know if it can really be change.  I mean / I guess it can be improved somewhat / I mean / we were saying before how / ya know / as more women come out of college and maybe go into business positions or into other fields and maybe / gain like some top positions there / I mean / it might change a little bit just as we see more women working / I don’t know if it will ever fully change.

[S16] Yea, I think we should just let it run it’s natural course and just see what happens / cause like / if you try to force it / then it’s just gonna end up making more problems / so 

[S14] Another question we have to ask is do we want everything to be exactly equal? I mean like / do we want a company to be like / split fifty-fifty female-male / I mean / I mean I’m sure there are women that want to live as like a housewife and males like as the primary like / moneymaker in the family / and ya know / in some families it may be the opposite but / I feel like as long as there’s like a fluctuation / like it’s up to personal choice / I mean that’s as close to equality as we’re going to get

[S13] Yea / I agree because like / I mean / even if you think like how / I know there’s not like a draft now / but when there was a draft / ya know / it was only males that were drafted / like / I wouldn’t want for there to be females to be drafted / like I wouldn’t have any desire / like ya know / some like law enforcement like police officers or firemen / like / there tend to be more / that tends to be more male dominated but I kinda think that just because of physical differences it makes more sense for those to be male dominated fields and I don’t really have anything against that
[S15] Yea / and I don’t either / and like / there’s definite reasons why there haven’t been like female drafts / and / I / I don’t know / I mean / as much as I like don’t like the fact that there’s some things that women can’t do / I mean 

[S16] Yea / it’s still kind of discrimination in a way

[S15] Yea / It is discrimination but like we can also be taken advantage of a lot easier / like if there was a draft and say you were like captured / I don’t know / that’s like going to the extreme 
[Laughter]
[S15] but I’m just saying / I don’t know / like with the firefighters and everything / like / not everybody has the strength to like hold / like equipment and stuff / there’s like a reason there’s more males in certain jobs

[S14] I mean / it’s that kind of / it’s that certain brand of feminism that says that women have to be men and / it’s the / that just can’t happen / I mean / um / embracing femininity / or like / I don’t know/ it’s just / that’s equality too

[S15] I think the [laughter] closest form about equality would be / um / like you said earlier / um / allowing people to make the choice / female or male / if you want to work in a certain job or not / and then having other people accept your choice / I think that’s like the closest form of equality / that we can get to

[S13] That’s a good point.
[Laughter]

[S16] um / I think that you might be able to consider it equality in how like / how men are / how men can have certain strengths in some things over women but where they’re lacking women make up for it / in like / um / I don’t know / deeper thinking or something / more emotional / they like kinda balance each other out in a way / and / that doesn’t really make either one / better / it just like / kinda balances out

[What do you think? Do you agree with that? Anybody? Have anything to say?]

[S14] Um / I guess something else / that I just started thinking about / my sister / um / I think she’s getting like a minor in gender studies or something and / like/ there’s this question of like what gender really is / like what makes a woman a woman and what makes a man a man / and / I don’t know / I don’t really know where I was going to go with that
[Laughter]
[S14] It seems like this question is still in the air / I mean / like with technology too / I mean / there are like / I mean there are like sex change operations and there are like men who feel that they’re like / better suited to live as a woman and / I don’t know / gender is just a highly like / like right now / like we’re not sure / like what it really means / or something [inaudible]

[S16] I guess you could look at it as just like a anatomical difference / like / just in / ya know / what / but if you look at it in other ways / I guess / I don’t know / that’s / it’s hard to like distinguish like / ya / like what separates genders / cause that’s like the obvious one / but then / you can’t really say for sure if anything else is true / that that would separate men and women

[S13] It is an anatomical difference / I mean / I’m not trying to put words into your mouth but what I was getting from what you were saying was that if you’re born with like / you’re born as a male but you feel that you should be a female / like what is that that you’re feeling / that gender like / I don’t know / that / I guess that there must be some other difference besides just the physical difference.

[S14] I guess what I was trying to get at was like / I mean/ there’s this like socially defined male and a socially defined female / and like / what are their real roles in society? And some men feel that their role isn’t as what is socially defined as male

[Anything you guys want to talk about?]
[Laughter]

[S13] I mean / this is something really random / but / um / I was trying to think of ways in which like men would be discriminated against versus women / and I was thinking that / if / I don’t know / you had a man who wanted to be like a preschool teacher / not that he couldn’t / but / it would be a little weird / like you might think that they’re some like 

[S16] Parents wouldn’t like that 

[S13] Yea

[S15] Molesters or something

[S13] Yea / so like / I don’t know / I guess that was just another example

[S15] That’s a good point though.  I mean like / just because it’s like not something you see everyday / you’re just like / you automatically think / oh what’s like behind the surface?

[S14] And I guess the opposite of that is like / talking about the draft before / like females in the army / so / there’s like / for every example for discrimination against one sex there’s an example for discrimination against the other 

[S13] Uh-huh. Yea.

[S16] Uh / yea / I don’t know if / I don’t know if the government really has / has anything to do with that / cause like / there’s no laws now that say anything different towards men and women / it’s equal towards everyone now.  Like it might be different in the real world I guess / but like / the / the / I guess like the / I don’t know / like the laws don’t really try to make a discriminate / try to discriminate at all

[S15] I guess going back to / um / the [inaudible] female to male / male to female / um / 
[Laughter]
[S15] um / some / science lesson of the day / some people are like born without like a specific gender and / um / they used to be that they’d just make them all females cause that was like the easier operation to perform but now they’re realizing that / beyond like the physical appearance / it’s the chemicals within the body and like brain that like make you / feel more one way or the other / and so they’re waiting ‘til they hit puberty to see which one they feel more like and then do the operation to like / conform them to whatever it is they feel / because / we were learning in science class back in the day [laughter] that a lot of people who are turned into females per say did not feel like that they were and they weren’t happy / so 

[S13] At the same time though / you have to think that that person is going to be kinda messed up / growing up like not knowing like / like when they’re a little kid though what do you

[S15] You just kinda keep them in like / not really 

[S13] Do they have like a short haircut or like what? Like I don’t know. It doesn’t make sense to me.

[S15] I don’t know.

[S13] Cause then like / they

[S15] When they turn like twelve is like when they do it / and so 

[S13] But then if they just like randomly change / like / what are you in sixth grade or so when you’re twelve and then the other kids in your class [laughter] are going to tease you so badly / Like if you were a boy and now you’re a girl? And you’re twelve?
[Laughter]

[S15]  I don’t know / it’s just what they’re thinking of doing because there’ve been a lot of mistakes in the past [inaudible] / I don’t know / probably maybe not ‘til twelve / maybe it’ll be like when they’re eight
[Laughter]

[S15] it was back in the day when I learned this / but it was interesting 

[S14] Well / I feel also that like / I mean the children / let’s say they’re raised as a female but they feel like they’re a male / they’re going to be really tomboyish

[S15] Right
[S14] I mean / they’re gonna probably wear pants / and / like dress like a boy

[S15] This is true

[Laughter]

[S16] K / we went in like a circle there
[Laughter]
[S16] I don’t know / like everything we said [laughter]

[Do you guys have any other thought on this topic?]

[Laughter]

[Ok, end of discussion]
