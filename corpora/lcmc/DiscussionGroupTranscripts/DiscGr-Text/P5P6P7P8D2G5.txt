GAY MARRIAGE

[Is everyone ready to begin?]

[S5 S6 S7 S8] Yes

[Ok. While some say to legalize gay marriage, others are still opposed to it. Do you think either side is right or wrong, and why?]

[S6] Yea / I think it’s ridiculous that gay people can’t get married

[S5] Ok / go with it

[Laughter]

[S6] To be honest / um / it / I don’t / the government is a secular institution / when people make the argument against gay marriage / they’re essentially arguing that marriage is a sacred institution that the government should protect / but / sacred implies religious / and it’s not the government job to protect religious institutions / it’s the government’s job to issue licenses / when a person applies for a marriage through the government they are applying for a marriage license / that’s a secular process

[S7] And actually / I looked up online / cause I am in a / like / homosexual relationship / and / I looked up online / and I saw / was like / the actual term marriage has nothing to do with a man or a woman at all / it means just / a common / like / union / a civil / or / um / what’s the other word / it was a civil union between two people / who live in the same home and share domestic / and / um / sexual relations / that’s all that marriage is / it has nothing to do with that / and I’m like / it’s like / you’re trying to separate church and state / and I’m like / well / you’re not even doing that / if you’re / I mean / cause honestly / I kind of see where they’re coming from / cause I had like a big discussion about this in my room / and a lot of my friends are like / they want to / it should be legalized / but / you’d have to understand that / marriage / like / the country was based on men and women / that’s how / like / all of us got here / and so / it’s gonna be hard for them to just change something as / like / concrete as that / but / I wouldn’t mind it / I would just be like / like / make the civil unions / or / that they have / like / allow the same things that come with marriage just don’t allow the title / if anything / because / I read a paper on it / it was actually like / all you need to do is just get forms / if you want to change your last name you can get a form and change your last name / if you want to / like / make / um / your partner become a guardian you / so that / just in case you go through legal problems or / medical problems / your parents don’t have that right over you / still / so / there’s like things that you / there’s a lot of paper work / and when the title or marriage comes in / it’s like automatically / and if they just allowed for civil unions / to / just / have all that / and just not the title / everyone would be so much happier

[Laughter]

[S5] I / yea / I agree with you guys that it should / um / be allowed / um / but / I think / I don’t know / if / um / it would be such a big change / that / I don’t / like / if it was up to me I don’t know what I would do / cause it’s just like / what you’re saying / what we’re so used to / and what / it would just almost be like / it would be so hard to / get used to / ya know / it’s not longer that you could guess out a married couple anymore / it’s like / you would have / there’s so many different options / then

[S7] Yea

[S5] Once that would happen / and I think that’s what some people are now scared about / like seeing this / it would be such a drastic change / it would / create like / that whole / um / what is the name for that family / like the nuclear family

[S8] Uh-huh

[S5] Is it that what it was called?

[S8] Yea

[S5] A nuclear family would totally change

[S8] Uh-huh

[S5] Like those things that we learned would just be so different / and I think there’s a lot of people that are set in their ways / and it may be until we all have kids that / there is actually change / cause / there’s / that / generation just had to die out

[Laughter]

[S7] Yea / cause I feel like our generation is gonna be like the most like / tolerant / 

[S5] We’re gonna make more / moves towards it

[S7] Yea / cause I mean / I feel like we’re gonna be the generation that’s like / ya know what / as humans / you all have / we all have certain rights / and / although it may not be what / ya know  / this human may like / it’s like / ya know 

[S5] At this time / I don’t know if / um / I would / vote it in / like now

[S7] Yea

[S5] Because I think it’s people / there aren’t enough people accepting of it / and then I think that would be unfair to say / if / there was a married couple and they had kids / they adopted / or they just had kids or something / I think the kids / because / not all people are accepting of it now / that it would be unfair to the kids / that the kids would get / taunted / or / something like that

[S7] Yea

[S5] But / I definitely would want it for the future / like the near future / but

[S7] After the generation older / leaves

[S5] Yea / I just / yea / I just feel like it would just / there would be so many people that are against it / and / have like a hate for / homosexual relationships / and / just / I / I can’t see it being / I feel like it would / there would just be a lot of bad that would come with

[S7] Yea

[S5] It happening

[S6] I can see where you’re coming from with that

[S5] Uh-huh

[S6] But / I think / like / people use similar arguments / to argue against civil rights / like in the sixties / ya know / I mean / and that’s something that had to be done

[S5] Oh / ok

[S6] And a lot of people felt / ya know what I mean?

[S5] Ok / yea / well / when you compare it to that / I mean

[S7] What do you mean? [Laughter]

[S6] Like / people arguing that / yes / we should have civil rights / like arguing in the sixties / yes / we should have civil rights / but / it’s going to cause so much trouble for everybody that we should keep putting it off

[S7] Oh

[S5] That is a very good point.

[S8] Yea / I don’t think that we can really say that we can actually legalize gay marriage because / is it really illegal in the first place / I mean / it’s really all up to the church / I think they’re just trying to / force / like / make it illegal / and that’s the problem here / but / yea / like / what you were saying / with like / it’s civil rights / like / yea / we have to learn to accept it / because it’s going to happen someday / and / sure / there’s gonna be a lot of issues leading up to / like / like / when people start seeing these couples with their kids / their kids will be ridiculed / I mean / but / it’s really part of the fight / part of the struggle to finally get this put into place / because / you can’t really make change without a fight / so 

[S6] Uh-huh

[S8] I think that’s one of the ways it has to be done 

[S7] That’s why I think it’s just like / like the whole civil rights movement / and / like / just / um / and even Latinos had a struggle / to get what they wanted to get / um / equal rights / as like Caucasians and stuff / and so / I feel like / you have to / really / there’s / nobody really recognizes / as change or as struggle if there wasn’t a fight / to get to that

[S8] Uh-huh

[S7] And / that’s even like / that can be applied in college / that can be applied like / everywhere / if / once there’s like a fight to show that you really got what you wanted / and it / is when it’s gonna be the most recognized 

[S8] Uh-huh

[S7] So

[S8] Yea / because / in all honesty / I don’t / like / I feel that the government doesn’t really have a say in like / who should be allowed to marry and who shouldn’t

[S5] Yea

[S6] Exactly

[S8] Because / you were saying earlier that they have the right to

[S5] So why do they / why/ how do they / take a / how do they 

[S6] Well / right now you can just ban same sex couples from applying for a marriage license

[S8] Yea

[S6] Through the government essentially / cause / when you / when a minister administers marriage / they’re acting at once as both a religious minister and / they’re officiating an official government ceremony at the same time

[S5] Uh-huh

[S6] Like / they’re administering marriage / you can / you can still apply for a marriage license / without having a ceremony done and still technically be married under the law / but that’s not necessarily the same as having a religious ceremony performed 

[S5] When / um / was a law made that banned gay marriage?

[S6] There is no law against gay marriage.

[S5] There is no law?

[S8] Yea / they can’t / I don’t think they can make a law because that would / um / that would defy the constitution / separation of church and state

[S5] So then what

[S8] So that’s why / that’s why / um / they’re trying to push an amendment / um 

[S6] Uh-huh

[S8] For the ban of it

[S5] Oh / so there is no amendment for / the banning of gay marriage

[S8] No

[S6] No

[S5] It’s just states don’t allow it?

[S7] Yea

[S8] Yea / states are / I think / um / states can / states grant the right to marry

[S5] When did states start banning it or was it / just / always / in a states

[S6] It’s kind of been an unspoken rule

[S8] Yea

[S6] For a long time

[S7] Isn’t it that states can do / kind of do / what they want / for their own group of people / and then it’s up to like / the government / to do like the national things / but / that’s why it’s only like certain states / like / who’s it / like / I know Massachusetts has it / um / New Jersey just

[S5] Like they’re allowed to?

[S7] Yea / New Jersey just got it / and / I forgot about / and California I think

[S5] New Jersey allows gay couples to marry? And California?

[S6] All foreign countries do too.

[S7] Yea

[S5] Foreign countries do?

[S7] Uh-huh

[S8] In some foreign countries it’s encouraged / it’s

[S5] Same sex

[S8] Yea

[S6] Yea / keeps the population down

[S8] Yea

[Laughter]

[S8] I think that’s one of the problems that

[S5] And then [Inaudible]

[S8] Like / that like / the current government has with the gay marriages because / they want to / kind of / like / right now / America keeps progressing and thriving / and / they want to keep that up / and they figure that if they allow same sex to marry / then / there won’t be / like / the reproduction that / we typically have / and / it will cause some kind of / like / little like / bump in the progression / and / I just think / that way / that and / like / their views are really traditional / and / they’ve grown up with this like / like / they’ve grown up Christian or / any belief system that doesn’t believe in / um / same sex marriage / and they just want to stick straight to that rather than trying to amend to their beliefs / and / they just / I don’t know / they just have this / like / mindset from / way back when / and it’s just kind of stuck with them / and / they’re extremely against it / like / I want to point out one example / um / the / I / I forget what the church is called / but / it’s run by a guy named Fred Phelps / and / it’s basically

[S6] Yea / they got the 

[S8] Yea / G-d hates fags / that’s their / basic slogan / they just have this far off belief that the bible strictly says that same sex couples aren’t allowed / like / homosexuality is like / a great sin / they / completely / they / I don’t know / they’re / they praised / um / what was his name / um / Matt Shepard / he was beaten to death outside of a

[S5] A teenager, right?

[S8] Yea / he was beaten to death outside of a gay bar / I believe / by three men / they basically / they created a monument / to put down / I think maybe in Alabama or somewhere / that / um / Matt Shepard entered hell on this date / and / I don’t know / that was / I just think it’s mindsets like that that keep it way out there / like

[S5] Yea / I think there’s a lot of angry people / concerned / worried that becoming / that concerning this topic

[S7] I feel that more so that / they’re just / they’re really / cause my parents are both Caribbean / and as a Caribbean that’s like the biggest no-no of life / they would 

[S5] Same sex?

[S7] Yea / Caribbean / I mean / Caribbean parents allow / surprisingly / they allow for / a child to / a girl to get pregnant at 15 / they’d be like / ya know what / ok / let’s go / let’s do this / they don’t like abortion / but / they / will not / they / it’s / they’re really against it because it’s just something that / just / they’re like / those are the people in the Caribbean that are just stuck / in / Catholic ways / or / in my case Episcopalian ways / it’s really stuck with that / and they’re like really bible reading / we do what the bible says no matter what, type of people

[S5] What does the bible / does the bible really flat out say / no to same sex?

[S6] The Old Testament does.

[S5] The Old Testament does?

[S7]  Yea / it’s in / I think it’s in Romans that says it

[S5] What does it / just

[S7] It says that homosexuality is a sin / but / it’s a sin like any other sin though / it’s a sin like / I don’t know / gossiping 

[S5] Murder?

[S7] No / that’s like / that’s like a / up there sin [Laughter]

[S5] So it’s just like gossiping?

[S7] Yea / like gossiping / or basically just doing / like anything / just wrong / not wrong like murder and not wrong like / like / one of them 7 deadly sins or whatnot / those are gonna get you sent directly to hell / but / like / it’s just like a sin / like / any other / small thing that committed another day

[S5] That’s / so then / for that to be forgiven you have to end relations [Laughter]

[S7] And they say then / Huh?

[S5] To be forgiven / for / like I’m just saying / to be forgiven for something like that / what do you have to do then / just end relations with

[S7] I don’t know / because when / I / I was at a point where I just didn’t / um / like / my parents are really / are really down in their ways / and I was always brought up just reading the bible a lot / so I just kind of had to get away from it / because / I was to the point where everyday I was like / ya know G-d, I’m sorry / like / everyday

[S5] For

[S7] For being

[S5] Do your parents know?

[S7] No

[S5] No?

[S7] Uh-uh / but / I’m / I don’t know / let’s / not / that’s a discussion for another day [Laughter]

[S5] Ok [Laughter]

[S7] But / I don’t know / they / I forgot what

[S6] I think those are very literally interpretations of the bible too

[S7] Yea

[S6] Ya know what I mean? Cause the bible also says you should take an eye for an eye

[S7] Yea

[S6] And people don’t walk around gauging people’s eyes out anymore either / so / I think / that because it’s such a literal interpretation of the bible, too / it’s something that a lot of people need to move past 

[S7] But / then again / it’s like / that / that thing though is like really / like 

[S6] Uh-huh

[S7] Ya know / it’s like really / an eye for an eye

[S6] It is very explicit

[S7] Yea / and at the end of that / it says that / um / just like an other sin / it will always be forgiven / and I’m like / that should / it’s just too much to go through as a teenager / and like / in this year / in this day and age where everything about yourself you kinda question / and just to walk around thinking that you can’t do this, you can’t do that, you can’t do this / it was just too much / so

[S6] I mean / most of the bible was written in the period of time when people / the Old Testament at least was written in a period of time when people were living nomadic lifestyles and that kind of clan society was very important so you had to have people having children so that the lineage would continue / so that you could keep passing down the property and the land and the animals and everything / so it was important that you didn’t breed / like / sons and daughters who were gay because then you wouldn’t have grandchildren to pass / to keep the line going / and I mean / I think a lot of the prohibitions of the / that are in the bible against homosexual relations stem from that / ya know what I mean?

[S5] Oh / keep going

[S6] No / that’s all

[S5] How / um / how do / what are some people’s explanations of / of homosexuality? Do you know / like / do you think it’s genetics? Ya know / some people say it must be the way they were raised / or is it genetics?

[S7] I kinda feel like it’s just something / just like your personality / cause

[S5] So genetics / more internal / like / that’s just the way you are / the way

[S7] Yea / and I feel like / cause I’m taking psychology now / so it’s one of the things that I’m kinda like 

[S5] That’s why I’m bringing it up / cause there was a little section

[S7] Yea / Yea / I’m kinda up in the air on stuff like that / because / it’s like / I feel like it’s not something like that’s in your genes / to / just how you’re gonna be / cause I feel like it’s kinda like / um / almost like a personality thing / and I / it’s like / it’s kinda like personality in the sense that / it’s like / something that’s developed / it’s either you’re a nice person / or you could be nice sometimes / it’s like a / up in the air type of thing / I feel like / being / um / in / being homosexual isn’t something that is / like / ok / here’s a gene that / that / this is the gene that’s defected or something like that / for / um / you to be homosexual / I feel like it’s just something that you’re kinda / there / with / I guess

[S8] I think it / I think it could be a combination of both / because / I mean / like / there’s two chemicals that really separate like / males from females / and that’s testosterone and estrogen / and / I think like / depending on like what amount of each you have in your system cause everyone has both / but / like / depending on what amount of each / like / that could also alter / like / your mind / but then / like / also / like / your environment will have an impact on that obviously / if you hang out with all these guys and you’re a female / for your entire childhood and you just kind of grow up / like / doing all these guys things / you’re gonna grow up / feeling like / you’re part of them / part of male society / and / you’re gonna / I don’t know / I think that could tell people all of it / but / just / I think it could be a combination

[S5] I grew up across the street from a boy / who was / two years old than me and I hung out with all his friends but / like / I hung out with them / I thought they were cute / and / like / I didn’t

[S7] Yea

[S8] Yea

[S5] Like / I / I would do things / like even from when we were younger / like we would be out playing hide and go seek / manhunt like over summer / like / water balloon fights and everything / but / I don’t know about / that never made me / like they treated me as / one of the guys / but I knew I wasn’t / like I would still run around in little skirts [Laughter]

[S8] That’s why I think it’s / probably / like a combination of the both those factors

[S5] Uh-huh

[S8] Like / that could really have an impact / and / to kind of as a kid / deciding where you want to stand / like / if you want to be part of them / be one of them or you actually want to be yourself and just be like / different from the group / be like / um / I’m trying to explain it in a different way now

[S5] Uh-huh

[S8] Like / yea / that’s really

[S6] A lot of recent research / um / has shown that there are different areas of the brain / like psychological experiments have shown / that there are specific areas of the brain that do appear to be / different in gay people

[S5] Uh-huh

[S6] Than / in like heterosexuals / um / and a lot of it’s been very contested / it’s like one of those areas of scientific research that’s kind of taboo nowadays because it’s so hotly contested / but / um / there’s actually a research group out in / I want to say Colorado / working with the U.S Department of Agriculture / and / with / um / some other U.S science organization / I forget the exact title / but they’re essentially / they’re looking at / sheep / populations / essentially / because it’s a big problem for breeders / for sheep breeders / when they have gay sheep / because those sheep

[S5] There’s gay sheep?

[S6] Yea / they can’t reproduce those sheep so if you buy like / a male that you intend to breed and it turns out that that male is gay / like / you just lost like 4 or 500 hundred dollars on your investment / and / um / they’re doing research into it and they’re finding

[S5] That’s very interesting.

[S6] Yea / they’re putting them in like pens with other males to / like chart their behavior and everything / and they’re finding that different portions of their brain are stimulated / by the sight of a male sheep when they’re gay versus when they’re heterosexual

[S7] Wow

[S5] So then it really isn’t / your environment / almost if sheep / are that way

[S6] Yea / I mean

[S5] Like it’s just something that’s been in us

[S6] There are gay penguins in the San Francisco Zoo.

[Laughter]

[S7] That’s funny.

[S5] See / I never heard of that / I never knew that animals expressed

[S6] Homosexuality is not uncommon in the animal world / actually

[S5] And don’t we stem from animals?

[S6] Uh-huh

[Laughter]

[S5] Wow

[So what do you think about President Bush’s push for / a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage? Or do you think the Federal Government should be involved in it?]

[S7] I can’t stand President Bush / at all / because

[S5] Do democrats / will they allow for it?

[S7] Democrats are like the / a really liberal, liberal group / and / they are / kinda like / I mean / ok / I saw this / in this paper that I read / it said / that history can’t define the definition of marriage / and / that’s exactly what he’s doing / I feel like / because / he is from Texas and because / like / a lot of Texans are like deep rooted and what they know / and this is how / they’ve always existed / I feel like he’s bringing his personal aspect / to / the government / and it’s actually not the government’s decision / as to who a person should love / or who they want to spend the rest of their life with / ya know / and it / I feel like / he’s just taking his personal / whatever he thinks / and just like letting it go / on everyone else / and it should be more of like / the people saying / this is what we want to do / you’re here to serve us / not the other way around / so

[S5] He’s taking a very bold stand / and just / flat out

[S7] And that’s why he’s losing

[S5] Saying it

[S7] His / poles are like / into the ground

[S8] I also think it’s a really bold move to try to put in an amendment that’s going to / contradict the constitution from the separation of church and state / and then instantiating this amendment that says / oh / but no / this is what marriage is / because this is what my beliefs say / because / I mean / that’s kind of pulling the church into the / into the constitution / and also / that’s / that would be the first amendment that really restricts the people rather than restricts the government

[S7] Yea

[S5] And amendments are meant to restrict the government.

[S8] Yea

[S7] That’s true / that’s like / cause a lot of / like / from back in the day / that’s what they like / the government came in and was like / this is / ya know / I’m the government / you’re the people / you adhere to me / and that was like the purpose of a lot of the / rules and stuff that were made and a lot of the different treaties and all those other type of things / were made to allow / for the government to kind of back away / and let the people kind of do what they want / and / in the sense / and the paper that I / I keep bringing up the paper that I read / but / it’s like / this woman / they / there’s a couple / they were gay / and / the woman / one woman got in a car crash and had a brainstem injury so she was like / in / like / this vegetative state / but she could still communicate / through like her eyes and through her like smile and stuff but she just couldn’t speak anything / and / because / they / they felt they were married / but / the law didn’t see them as married / so / it allowed for their parents / her parents to still have guardianship rights over her / and / um / they put her in a facility that did nothing for her to come back / to / ya know / at least / moving her fingers / moving her muscles around / being able to kind of walk at all / because of the fact that her father just didn’t really like her / her father wanted her to die so he put her in like [inaudible] place that didn’t do anything to help her / and / that’s why / if they had / instituted like / ok / well / ya know / allowed people certain rights / because they are violating rights / they’re violating / well / because she was disabled it violated her right to speak / and / ya know / all those type of things / it’s just / I could go on for days about this topic / sorry / [Laughter]

[So what do you think about that? What she was talking about]

[S5] About the woman?

[The rights / um / I guess]

[S5] Silence

[S6] Yea / I mean / I think it / it does / to a large extent come down to who you want / eventually you want to ultimately be responsible for you / in the event that you’re incapacitated / I think that’s a big part of it too / and I think that’s something people have the right to choose / and if they want to choose that within the context of marriage and outside the context of / how / whoever has normally defined marriage up to this point / they should have the right to do that

[S7] Yea

[S5] I think all people should have the same rights / to be able to / yea / forgetting about their sexuality / that everyone should have / equal rights

[S7] I feel like it’s another form of racism / in a way / it’s not racism of color but it’s racism of people’s lifestyles / and / just / like / kind of hindering them to / just conforming to what everything / what everybody else is doing / and / it’s like separating them / I mean / for some homosexuals / like / if you just saw me on average it wouldn’t come to mind that / ya know / maybe she’s gay or something like that / but / it’s just / it’s not something that’s worn but when people find out / they’re kind of like / well she’s gay so she needs to go to the side / and / ya know / it’s just another form of discrimination / I guess you could / it’s not really racism / I guess racism is discrimination in a way / so

[Do you have any other thoughts?]

[S8] Um / yea / I want to agree with you on that point / like / it / it definitely is / discrimination against a certain group of people based on something about them / their character

[S7] Yea

[S8] And I don’t think / I don’t think that’s right at all / I mean / you can’t really say that one person is better than another and deserves this because / they’re this way / when this person doesn’t deserve it because they’re / homosexual / I mean / that’s just really / just / I don’t know / restricting a person who was / born equal into this country / and / if you’re gonna say they’re born equal into this country you should / provide them with the same opportunities as everybody else / and I think marriage is one of those opportunities that everybody / well / most people seek marriage in their lifetime / and / when you’re trying to restrict that / it’s just / it’s definitely discriminating just as bad as racism in some cases

[Do you guys have any other thoughts on this topic? Ok. End of discussion.]
