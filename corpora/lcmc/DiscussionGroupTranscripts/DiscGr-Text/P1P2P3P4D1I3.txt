GROUP 1234
IRAQ WAR

[The controversial war in Iraq has made news headlines almost every day since it began. How do you feel about the war?]
[S4] Well, it’s obvious that it hasn’t gone very well /but you can’t /hindsight is twenty-twenty /you can’t look back and justify to a degree your opinions /based on ya know what happened /you gotta base your decision on what information you have available at the time.
[S2] Yeah /I don’t think /I’m not sure if we can pull out right now because I mean if we leave then the situation there is just gonna get horrible /probably /but at the same time I don’t know what we can accomplish from staying because I feel like we don’t have sort of a set plan /we’re just kind of like there and I don’t know if there’s a lot of things that they don’t tell like the media and everything / but uh I, I never hear anything like real, solid goals /just kinda we’re there and we keep sending troops /and we’re gonna be there for however long it takes
[S3] Um /I am and forever /from the first day /have not been a supporter of the war /um /I didn’t really get in the beginning what the /I mean they said the weapons of mass destruction /they were going in to get them and then you know surprise there was none in the country /they couldn’t find any /and um I just never thought that there was a clear cut purpose /you know, they said it was part of the war on terror, but um I mean what happened to finding Osama Bin Laden who’s the reason that we initially got /you know September 11th was initial reason I thought we got into the war on terror /and um you know he was responsible for the regime that caused 9-11 /so you know that kinda fell ya know off the water when the war in Iraq started /and I just have never seen the point of the war
[S4] But what if we didn’t go into Iraq and they ended up having /Saddam had weapons of mass destruction /cause I mean he’s used them before on the Curds and Northern Iraq
[S2] Also, I mean we don’t know what kind of intelligence or you know information the government had /I mean it could have seemed like it was solid and sure that /that Saddam Hussein had WMD’s /but I mean we can’t be sure /we don’t know
[S1] And that’s the only thing /if we /like let’s say we had been debating about it and we had decided not to go look for them and then they use them
[S4] Right, we’d be saying why didn’t we
[S1] We’d be like could you imagine if we went in? /I feel like /I feel like in that case it was important to go and look for them because if we had found them we woulda been like nice /saved ourselves /so we looked and around and we didn’t have them /they didn’t have them /which is kind of not /you know /I don’t know I feel like it was important because we could have just turned our backs on it and then what could have happened?
[S2] I’m not so sure the fact that we didn’t find any indicates for sure that he didn’t have them at the time /cause I mean I could imagine he could have however many thousands of weapons depots /I mean in the second that he got sign of an invasion he could have just ordered anyone to just take it and move it out
[S4] Or dismantle it
[S2] Yeah
[S1] Yeah, they were probably dismantled, if anything.
[S4] But, I mean one good thing that did come out of it was that we removed Saddam /I don’t think people understand how /ya know /bad his regime was. He, he /if there was any signs of dissent /he would just take people /his secret police would take people and take them away and torture them and then kill them /and their families too /so I think it’s important that he’s out of power
[S3] I agree.
[S4] Even though it destabilized the country
[S2] I just don’t know how sure /they uh /or how feasible our objectives are for establishing a democracy there /cause I mean it’s a democracy in the middle of the Middle East /how’s it gonna work?
[S4] Right, people are different.
[S1] And I think that’s a lot of what’s keeping us there /because we’re kind of like let’s establish a democracy and it wasn’t gonna be like alright it’s established, see you later /because they don’t /they’re not /like you said, they’re different people /they’re not going to just be like oh democracy, ok we’ll just pick this right up /they’re not /you know /democracy always seems like the easiest solution and the easiest kind of thing like that, but maybe for those people it’s not
[S3] And it’s such an extensive process to implement a democracy on people who have no interest in it which I think
[S1] Right, and it’s such a difference than what they had /whereas to go even from /I mean think about how we started with rights and went from it /I mean we even didn’t start as a completely /you know or government’s not the same now as it was /um and I feel like to place on /to place a democracy on people who just had something completely different /and I think that’s why we’re still there /because we’re kinda like oh it didn’t work yet /but
[S4] It’s almost like /it’s almost like the U.S. has a cold war mindset still /like they’re trying to spread democracy /but I mean there’s no /communism really left anymore /so it really doesn’t make sense /why they’d still be doing that
[S1] I feel like if they coulda done /and I don’t have any good examples /but like if they coulda done /I feel like they coulda helped them in another way /I mean obviously getting rid of Saddam was like the biggest step ever and then maybe not implementing a democracy, but implementing some certain rights or giving them sort of government /maybe is there like a more basic government system they could have tried to employ?
[S2] Someone in my chat group said that /um /the U.S. /what they’re doing in Iraq could be compared to like /or could be called modern day like colonialism
[S3] Yeah
[S2] Like what do you guys think about that?
[S1] I never thought about it like that.
[S2] I mean I could definitely see us like taking on that imperialist role /like just forcing our views on a people that’s not ready for it, clearly
[S3] And it didn’t end well with them.
[S1] Yeah, I was gonna say didn’t it become a revolutionary war? 
[Laughter]
[S4] I think because the U.S. is the most powerful country /that they see /they see themselves as having the responsibility to intervene /maybe that’s where colonialism could come from
[S1] Also being the most powerful /we see a country that’s just so weak and then /I mean obviously if we think about it /we’re like oh a country that’s not doing so well, given them a democracy /like it does seem like /if you don’t think any further than that /like democracy works out well /let’s give them one of those /like it does seem like a pretty good idea until you try and think of how you do it /and I think /I think that’s why because they /I mean it’s been, what two years that we’ve been there?
[S2] I think over two years.
[S3] Like three
[S1] Three?
[S3] I mean, since 2001.
[S1] Four? Great /but I’m /ya know /but it just keeps /I just feel like why they’ve still had to be there because they’re realizing it didn’t work out exactly how they planned
[S4] I don’t think they anticipated like Al-Kaida sending people to Iraq to like [inaudible] /that’s where they went wrong there /I think
[S3] Yeah, I mean they should have recognized they weren’t dealing with normal war tactics where it’s like this against this and you’re just gonna go in and fight the battle and leave with a victory /you know? / I mean 
[S2] Yeah, I think the President at this point just needs to stop being so stubborn and just open his ears to the country and just listen /cause he’s getting so much criticism now /I mean
[S3] Yeah, but even when I listen to the criticism and I’m feeling the same way /it’s like what’s he gonna do? What can we do at this point? We can’t just take those people and up and leave. It’s going to be mayhem there.
[S1] And then we’d have to do it again.
[S3] The place is destroyed. You know /but on another side there’s people’s sons and husbands and you know /whatever /and people have daughters dying over there for, for /you’re thinking for what? How is this gonna change /if nothing has changed in these years we’ve been there then what’s going on? I mean 
[S4] It’s the typical case of choosing between you know the better of two evils.
[S3] Right
[S4] Cause I mean if we stay it’s like, what are we going to accomplish? But, how can we leave at this point?
[S3] Right, so I don’t even know what /I mean obviously I’m not a President and I don’t know all the things he knows, but even listening /I don’t know what he’s gonna say to me because I don’t know
[S1] What he would do
[S3] To advise /I mean I don’t even know what to say /to think about this because I don’t know what the best thing to do is /who does?
[S1] Yeah
[S4] I don’t know who does.
[S1] I mean even /I have a friend who’s on his second time over in Iraq now /and he’s over there now and they told him that he doesn’t know when he’s coming back and all those sorts of things /and I mean as much as they’re fighting and it’s obviously what they believe in /What is it anymore? /Like what are they exactly fighting for? /and obviously you’re trying to fight for the best for that country /but even what /I don’t even know if we know what we’re doing anymore
[S3] Right
[S1] Like I don’t /I mean obviously I’m not /when he gets home I’m not gonna bring up the war, but I don’t even know if they would know exactly what they’re fighting for in /just in direct terms of that /whereas do we know what we’re fighting for anymore?
[S3] And then listening to /to my Dad talk about the Vietnam War /it’s very similar /the stories /he was just like at some point we were just over there like what are we doing, you know? /and he’s like these people are asking me to fight every day for my life and to do things for something that I don’t even know what’s going on /how do you ask 18 to I don’t know to /you know how do you ask kids and you know adult men to do that when they don’t know what they’re fighting for and they’re risking their lives /it’s not small matters
[S1] Especially then when they didn’t really have a choice.
[S4] I mean even the troops /like don’t even know what their fighting for
[S3] Right
[S1] Right
[S4] And that’s a morale killer
[S1] I mean, yeah, and that’s why we’ve always /in a lot of the past wars that you feel like people are successful because they’re fighting for what they believe in /they’re fighting for what they love /they’re fighting for what they think is right. How are you fighting when you don’t know what you’re fighting for? /When you don’t really know what you’re doing everyday by going out and waking up and risking your life
[S2] That’s why the whole like idea of a just war and all the theories behind that and the people who’s jobs are just dedicated to that study /that’s why like that typically is so important to the military /just so that they know /I mean if they’re putting their life on the line /they want to be fighting for something meaningful and just I guess
[S4] You look at World War II and the Gulf War and there’s like /there’s like no other option /you gotta fight /wasn’t really clear or at least there was a divided opinion for the Iraq War
[S2] We were talking about in one of my classes /um /five different points of um what makes a war just and he showed how the war in Iraq hardly meets like any of them /I think /cause it’s all about like feasibility of your objectives and like proportion /I mean like we /we sent in like highly modern technology and it’s against these guys who just have AK’s and everything /I mean 
[S4] Suicide bombers
[S2] Yeah
[S3] To be honest with you, I did /the just war theory /I learned that in religion /like as soon as we got into the war /like a month later my teacher’s like we’re gonna take a break from learning about the Old Testament /we’re gonna do this /and we were like ok /so we did it then and didn’t even /at the time I don’t think more than four or so matched /so I mean less than that /the same amount of numbers didn’t match up /I mean even /that was years ago /that was a couple /ya know I was in high school /that was at least three years /I don’t know what year it was /I’d say at least two to three years ago and we’ve been over there for an extra two to three years since then /it’s just ‘it didn’t make sense to me then /it doesn’t you know /same with you doing it know
[S1] It’s not gonna make anymore sense now.
[S3] Right
[S2] I think the most important thing that I want to see is just clear objectives /I mean it’s either we’re doing this or we have to get out. We just have to accept the fact that nothing is happening /I mean no progress is being made.
[S4] I think it’s hard for us to make educated decisions though, because we don’t have all of the intelligence
[S2] Yeah, exactly.
[S4] That the decision makers have
[S1] I agree. It’s easy for us to talk, but we don’t actually
[S4] We don’t have the information.
[S1] Right
[S2] Yeah, it’s the same with the whole WMD thing. 
[S3] Right /but do you /I mean what were the /what were the reasons in the beginning /I mean, that you guys can remember, for going into Iraq? /Like weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein
[S4] Just to stop terrorism
[S3] I mean that’s not very clear. That would be nice, but that’s just
[S1] Good luck with that.
[S2] Yeah, it seems like that’s uh something that we could just turn towards any like ya know /he has oil, we’re going there
[S3] Right, right
[S2] Oh yeah, what do you guys think about that? The whole oil situation.
[S3] I think that was somewhat involved in the objectives.
[S2] Do you think like maybe Bush is just stalling the entire war? I mean cause right now it’s not safe enough to actually take that oil out of like the country. So do you think /what do you guys think?
[S1] It’s definitely an option. I never really thought about it in that respect.
[S4] It’s a good conspiracy theory.
[S1] Right
[S4] I don’t know, but /if that’s the case
[S3] I think it had more to do with prices. You know and making money within the United States at the time. I mean just think about how much like right after Katrina /that week after it was like how much did it go up? Like 50 cents or something ridiculous? Remember over night like people were going to the gas stations? I remember my Mom like woke up and went and got gas in the middle of the night and I was like what are you doing? It was just /you know /outrageous /and to take a situation like this /what a good time to pump the gas prices up and it has /and we’ve all been hurting from it for a while now /so I think that was /that seemed to me to be an objective of some sorts
[S2] It’s kind of scary. I mean it reminds us of like World War II times when they had to ration.
[S3] Yeah, yeah it’s true.
[S4] I mean the end of oil is in sight /it’s within like a hundred years we’re gonna run out of fossil fuels /so we gotta find other sources of energy
[S2] And they say once /um /once oil become so rare that I mean /it’s just gonna evolve into wars just over oil /like world wars
[S3] Definitely /which is disgusting /because it’s oil
[S1] And it’s also /and it’s also why we’re hoping it becomes like obsolete by then /you know with all like they’re trying to get our cars to run on vegetable oil /I mean and this is like you know getting ridiculous /but I mean if /not that a hundred years is a long time but if the end of it is in a hundred years /hopefully we have another /I mean they’ve only really started to do this /I’m sure people have worked on it for a long time, but really a lot /you’ve only heard about it in the last couple of years /and we’ve made some you know /some better
[S4] They say they’re making big strides but you know
[S1] I mean how big could they be making if they’re gonna keep working on it /you know?
[S3] Something to keep in mind is they’re never gonna /well I shouldn’t say never but I can’t foresee them developing anything that we can make in our homes /I mean vegetable oil /you know something that the government can’t make money on
[S1] But even if it becomes something /no, I mean I definitely think it’ll become something that the government can make money on /but, if it’s something we’re not gonna run out on in the next one hundred years /I’m for it /you know, if it’s something that is gonna be an alternative to oil and we don’t have anymore oil
[S2] Like Hydrogen /you can just get that by splitting water /get H-two and then oxygen gas
[S3] I think they’re hesitant to do that though.
[S2] Um /coming back to Iraq /um I hear last night on TV that we have like 160,000 people over there extra that are not actually military, but like privateers that are like mercenaries /so we actually have about like over 250,000 troops there when everybody only thinks that we have like /like I think its like 145,000 like military /what do you guys think about that? /I mean /I mean that’s /I think that’s the most
[S3] Yeah, I didn’t even know that.
[S2] I mean in Vietnam I’m not sure if we hired mercenaries to
[S1] I mean that’s a ridiculous amount of people.
[S2] Yeah
[S4] And there’s a demand for it.
[S2] I’m not sure, but I think there’s more actually hired people over there than actually U.S. military /actually no /no, there’s less /[laughter] /a little bit less
[S3] I don’t know.
[S4] I don’t think it’s a bad thing that they’re doing that.
[S2] No?
[S4] Because they’ve got to have a certain number of personnel and by hiring those defense contractors then that frees up the standard army soldiers /so it like allows them not to be there for so long and everybody gets upset when people have to stay longer /so I think that kind of alleviates that problem a little bit
[S2] Well that’s true /yeah
[S1] And I think that it’s also a lot of people who /I mean as we all agree we really couldn’t come up with a main like reason for the war /and I think that’s a lot of it too /is what makes it even worse because then you hear things like that you’re like oh man and they send more people over there and we’re not even doing anything /but, if there was a clear goal in sight and these people were working towards something then I don’t know if there’d be any objection /I mean there would obviously be objection to having people over there, but not as much if you thought there was a clear goal in sight /but that’s what makes people more angry about it /is that they’re not even sure what they’re fighting for /much less why there’s so many
[S4] Do you think it could happen like with Iran? The same kind of thing? Or even North Korea?
[S2] Hmm.
[S3] I mean that’s definitely a possibility.
[S4] Or have we learned our lesson?
[S1] I mean, you’d think.
[S2] Well, North Korea is a definite threat / I mean Iraq
[S4] Yeah, that guy’s a nut case.
[Laughter]
[S2] I mean Iraq /like I don’t think it was as clear cause of the whole was there WMD’s or not? /but I mean North Korea /they have a massive army /I’ve heard that like eventually it’ll surpass ours /I’m not sure if it’s like getting to that point already
[S3] They’re a definite threat /that’s a problem /that’s definitely gonna happen soon /which is another reason why I feel like we’re wasting time in Iraq /ya know? /like that’s a huge problem /I agree with him /so
[Any other thoughts? So, I mean I know you guys have talked about this a little bit, but do you think it’s gone on long enough or do you think that we should continue to be over there?]
[S4] I think it’s obvious that it’s gone on long enough. But, I think that Bush just has to realize that ya know it’s time to /it’s time to get out
[S2] Admit defeat
[S4] Right
[S3] It’s just so /he’s supposed to be /he’s the person we chose to speak somewhat truthfully to us, and ya know /and he sits there every time that he has a speech and he’s just like this is great, this is the best war we’ve ever been involved with /ya know he seems to just act as if he doesn’t hear any bad things or 
[S1] He acts like we don’t have a TV.
[S3] Like /ya know /like we have no idea what’s going on and it’s like /ya know /World War II and we’re just all behind the country /it’s just /it’s not like that and I think it’s so /it’s making people obviously his ratings are way down /it’s making people strongly dislike the fact that he’s talking to us like we know nothing
[S2] So what do you think his motivation is?
[S3] Huh /I have no idea /I mean 
[S1] I think what his motivation needs to be is looking at other problems like North Korea and things like that and kind of focusing on what could be in the future instead of going on /I mean not to say that we didn’t /I mean the argument about if we had to be in Iraq or not /like we were there /we are there /it’s happened /but now at this point in time the argument is like stay there or go /and I mean we do have so many people there that even take some of them /you know /like move some of them and I mean I think we have to realize that there are bigger threats out there right now /because Iraq is not a threat to us right now really /like so much /and that /we need to realize that there are other threats to us
[S3] And I think that maybe at this point, he knows that there’s an election coming up /he’s almost done /he’s just, I’m not gonna do anything with this /this is just gonna stay here and I’m gonna let somebody else deal with it /cause ya know at this point if he were to pull everybody out of that there’d be such a mess over there /his 
[S1] I kind of agree /leave it as a stand-still 
[S3] He would look terrible.
[S2] But, how feasible is that though /for a man to actually say that /just for his reputation to keep all these troops over there /and plus, I mean won’t his reputation go up if he pulls them up? / I mean the entire country /I mean even in the situation we have /at worst, the entire country wants them out
[S3] Not the entire country /most
[S2] Well, no not /yeah most /I mean 
[S3] I mean, but /it could end really badly /maybe not right away /but for us /you know /it’s just gonna turn into a worse situation than when we went over there if we leave 
[S1] I think a lot of it is he’s not worried about re-election /he’s not worried about /I mean not to say this is not his main motivation /but he’s not worried about re-election /he’s not worried about anything like that /so I think he’s going /I think he’s gonna say that he’s just doing it for the way that he can be like no, it’s fine /everything’s ok /I believe that /I mean there has to be a part of him that believes that they’re doing something /cause he wouldn’t just be leavin em there /you’re right /you’re not gonna leave all of your American soldiers over there for no reason /and they’re getting hurt everyday /but, I think there’s definitely /so he has to believe it somehow /but, I think a lot of it is there’s not really a motivation for him to have to make a decision right now /cause it’s like you said /I mean it’s kind of like fifty-fifty because if he leaves them there, there’s gonna be half the people that want them back, but if he takes them out then it could be something worse
[S3] Yeah
[S2] If it was such a simple decision then why hasn’t he
[S1] He woulda been /exactly /but if it was such a simple decision, it woulda been done
[S3] And he has people behind the scenes /you know /acclaimed war people telling him /you know /um generals and such /telling him /ya know /what to do /so we don’t even hear of them /we just hear what he has to say and he has people telling him what to do and he has America /you know /his ratings going down and he /you know /is experiencing pressure from so many places and these people might be telling him this is great /we’re accomplishing great things over here /we’re doing the right thing here, you know, George, and he’s hearing us say /you know /we hate you and we want them out now /it’s not /never an easy thing or an easy decision to make /but, um 
[S2] Yeah, I feel like he must know something we don’t.
[S1] He does. I mean he’s gotta know something.
[S3] They always do.
[S2] Well, I mean he knows a lot of things that we don’t.
[Laughter]
[S3] Yeah
[S2] But /uh /you know what I mean /because like you said he doesn’t have to worry about re-election, so I feel like since he doesn’t have to worry about that he can actually do /like you said what
[S1] What he should be doing /so he’s gotta be thinking that this is something /he has to think that it’s best to keep people there or he wouldn’t be
[S4] Right, he’s not like an evil guy.
[S1] Right, he’s not like let’s ruin America /like that’s not why /like I really can’t see /I mean sure people don’t like him /but I really don’t think it’s a conspiracy theory like him against the world
[S3] But /like we’re saying what he should be doing as in taking them out, but I don’t think that /even though I think the war’s gone on too long and it’s the wrong thing and /I don’t think bringing them back right now you know just get out of there, get on the bus, come home, grab a plane /I don’t think that’s the right thing to do because it would just be /just a shit hole over there
[S1] And then it also becomes an issue of what do you do then /if taking them out’s not /if taking them out’s not the answer /and leaving them there is making everything not so good /then ok like what does that mean?
[S2] I agree /we need to come up with something 
[S1] There’s gotta be a solution. I think that could also be part of it. He has to believe that there’s some reason they’re there /but also it could be /so even if he started to believe that we shouldn’t be there, what should we do? /what is he gonna do with them? /gonna make a human wall around the country? /like there’s nothing to do with them /like he can’t win either way basically
[S4] I think the aim was to train the Iraqi police force and it just hasn’t panned out like we thought it would.
[S1] Right
[S3] And plus at this point he can’t make any rash decisions /you can’t afford it and human lives over there can’t afford it /and Americans can’t /so it’s just I think that even if he didn’t have an election coming up /he can’t make any decisions right /this month /during this /until elections I don’t think he can make any decisions until then necessarily
[Final wrap-up thoughts on the issue? Just go around and give me your final sum-up feelings.]
[S1] I think something needs to be done and I don’t think now is the time, and I don’t know what to be done /is to be done /so I don’t know /I mean that was just like not needed to be said actually /but you know I don’t know if there’s anything /something needs to be done, but we don’t know what it is and they don’t know what it is or I feel it woulda been done
[S2] We need to either come to a solution or just accept the fact that there is none /and accept that lesser of two evils, and pull out
[S1] Focus on other things that we need to be worried about.
[S3] I mean I don’t have anything unique to say. I feel the same way as a lot of people in America, but /um /ya
[S4] I think we should /we should just let the informed people /the analysts /they should make the decisions, and not us and Bush should be open to their advice
[S1] Cause ultimately, they are the ones that know everything /it’s not us
[S4] And they don’t have a crystal ball. They’re just making estimates.
[Ok]
