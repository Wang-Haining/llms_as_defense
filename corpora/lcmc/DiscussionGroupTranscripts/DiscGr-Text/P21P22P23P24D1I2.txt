IRAW WAR

[Everyone ready? Ok. All ready? The controversial war in Iraq has made news headlines almost everyday since it began. How do you feel about the war? Anyone can start?]

[S21] Um / [laughter] / in the beginning I was really for it / um / cause / I was really affected by 9-11 / so I was all for it / I really didn’t care / um / now / now after seeing / and just reading about it / and reading how many people have just / have died and everything / it’s just / it’s so pointless / it’s not doing anything / I don’t think / I really don’t think that we’re like / getting anywhere / I don’t know / and I don’t think that we’re going to 

[S22] Do you think it might have been an outlet for people’s emotions after 9-11?

[S21] Yea / I do / and I feel like if / but I feel like if we pull out now / I feel / I don’t know / we’re in a really bad spot / I don’t know/ like [laughter] I really don’t know what would happen if we pulled out now either

[S24] With the way I understand / it was more than a war on terrorism / but also / to try and bring democracy to the country that was under that tyrannical rule for such a long time / and my basic / um / outlook on this / pretty much the same way as yours that I / I agree with the purpose and I agreed with it early on but it just seems / not to be efficiently 

[S21] Doesn’t seem like it balances out anymore / now that like / it’s been going on for so long / and / really not a lot has gotten done / and people have just / died / it’s just / it’s

[S24] It’s a drain on our economy back home

[S21] Yea / It is.

[S22] And we owe our souls to China 

[Laughter]

[S22] because / yea 

[S21] and now even / isn’t England / aren’t they pulling out / like / some of there

[S22] Yea

[S23] Yea

[S22] And China’s financing all their debt / so we owe them / we owe them like a huge credit card

[S24] Just had like a 1 trillion dollar surplus in their budget

[S22] Projected / yea

[S24] Yea

[S23] Wow

[S21] So like not even like our main allies / like staying in there / it’s just

[S23] Yea

[S21] But I mean / we’re in / I don’t know what we’re gonna do / like / cause like / again I feel like if we pull out / we’re even more screwed / so / I don’t / I don’t even know

[S22] Have you guys ever played jenga?

[S23] Yes

[S21] Yea

[S22] Imagine if

[S21] Exactly

[S22] Imagine if like the one / like block / in the bottom was a crack pipe / and you were like crack is so bad / I need to get this crack pipe out of there / and you pulled it out and the whole thing came toppling down / like / it sucks that there was a crack pipe in there / but the crack pipe was keeping the jenga things up / and the [inaudible] regime / sucked / they did horrible things / they gassed their own people / they were terrible / but like / they maintained some kind of order / and now / that we’ve pulled the crack pipe out of the jenga pie and we took the [inaudible] regime out / and made it illegal / and like killed as many of them as we could / like / the pieces are fighting with each other on the ground / like the Sunni, Shiites, Kirk  / hated each other

[S21] Yea / they’re fighting with each other / I mean / there’s not / there’s only so much we can do / I feel like / like / even if / like we tried / we did what we could / but / I mean / it’s not worth losing more of / like / more of our like military / it’s stupid to send more people over there / how many people are over there / like 100,000 people 

[S22] I don’t know

[S23] I don’t know

[S21] Like over in that one area / it’s stupid

[S23] I don’t know / I’m not well-informed on it / but / I feel like / the government really hyped it up and played on people’s emotions a lot after 9-11 / and especially with the weapons of mass destruction / and everything / and 

[S21] But I mean / like / in the beginning / it felt like / like / at least I felt / it had to be done / like / I feel like we had to do / we had to do something / after that / I feel like we just couldn’t / sit there / I don’t know

[S23] I don’t know / I felt like / going after Osama Bin Laden / was a good idea / but when it got to Saddam Hussein / and / Iraq

[S21] It just branched out

[S23] And / Yea / it just took on a whole life of its own

[S21] Yea.

[S23] The thing started out as like / us going into get Osama Bin Laden / 

[S21] I feel like that was almost his motive / like / now he even screwed us even more
[Laughter]
[S23] He’s in the Middle East now / and hey / as long as we’re here 

[S21] Now he brought us in there and we’re even more screwed

[S23] Right

[S22] Well / like / I mean / yea / like that’s why we went into Afghanistan / was to get Osama / and like

[S23] Right

[S22] And we tried to pay off all these warlords / to / track him / and they actually like / let him out the back door [Laughter] when we invaded / and then / we invaded / Iraq / so now we’re on both sides of Iran / like / ha-ha-ha / you guys can’t do anything / like we can actually invade them

[Laughter]

[S21] And it’s / it’s not like we’re even fighting them / cause they’re so different / they’re just / like / there’s no organization / it’s just / they’re gonna shoot whoever’s in front of them

[S23] Right / there’s no way we can win this

[S21] Yea

[S23]  I mean / we’re going in in uniforms and stuff and they’re like the townspeople

[S21] Right / and you think they’re civilians / until they shoot you [laughter]

[S23] And unless / we change and we look like Iraqi civilians / with machine guns / there’s no way we’re gonna win the war

[S21] Right

[S22] That almost sounds like Vietnam.

[S21] I mean / it does

[S23] It / that’s what it sounds like / except we did the same thing in Vietnam

[S21] Don’t they always compare it to that?

[S22] A lot of people / it’s a popular thing / a lot of people are doing lately / it’s / um / and you know / the majority of Americans really don’t give a shit 

[S21] That’s true / I think that’s true

[S22] Yea / I like just learned about this in political philosophy / there’s this dude 200 years ago / it was like / once you people are all comfortable / none of you are going to care about anything else / and it’s true / cause like / all of those middle eastern countries are the same / like / no one even really cares / at all / so that means that / whoever’s at the top just gets to do whatever they want as long as they make a good argument for it / because no one really gives a shit

[S24] But wouldn’t you agree that something had to be done over there?  I mean / you mentioned that we totally broke everything done even though there was some sort of order / but / without breaking something down / I mean that sounds cliché / how could we ever build it back up?

[S22] If something / had to be done in Iraq / then something has to be done in Darfur / and something has to be done

[S24] I agree / there’s stuff that need to be done all over the world / but you gotta start somewhere / right

[S21] Yea / but 

[S22] Well / yea / you gotta start somewhere / I mean

[S23] I’m so ignorant / like I really don’t feel like / I don’t understand why it’s our problem

[S21] Same / I mean / is it our job to do it?

[S22] We’re the world police.

[S23] Right / right / what’s the UN for?

[S24] I mean / if not / somebody / like the UN really is not gonna take any action / they’re just more of a 

[S21] [Inaudible] yea / they just sit / at a table / and say / you do that

[S24] They’re not gonna take action / I mean / what if you were

[S23] But they could / they could have more power

[S24] I don’t think they really have that much power to actually take action / so much as just

[S21] Yea

[S24] A group of countries that’ll make decisions and say / this is our stance / they can’t really / send / they don’t have an army to send to war

[S21] They make / a plan 

[S23] No / I mean / I think it would be a good idea to give the UN more power / instead of getting into situations like this on our own
 
[S24] Right
[S21] Right

[S24] I just think if we were one of the citizens over there in that situation / wouldn’t we want somebody to help us / I mean / just / 

[S21] Yea / I do 

[S23] Well / or / you’d be like / what the hell? Get out of my country / which is

[S24] Those are the people that would be shooting us / that are in the war with us right now / and that’s part of the problem 

[S23] Well / that’s like half the country / 

[S22] But like / the UN is just an expression / of how powerful countries are / outside of it anyways / like if the UN tells us to do something / we’re not gonna do it / like / I mean / the big bullies are still bullies on the floor of the UN just as much as they could be in the rest of the world /like / they had / the UN made this thing called / I don’t know if it was the UN / or who it was / but / it might have been / I think the UN had something to do with it / it was the ICJ / the International Court of Justice / and one day / basically / I think a lot of it had to do with one case too / we just decided that we were gonna withdraw from compulsory jurisdiction / which means /  we / say / oh / well / we don’t have to do what you tell us to do anymore / and / I mean / what’s the UN gonna do about it?

[S21] I don’t know / in the beginning / I just felt like we had / if we didn’t go over there I was gonna be so pissed [Laughter] But / um 

[S22] Well / but / that’s because / you thought they had enough weapons to blow your house up

[S21] No / not even that / I wasn’t concerned with that / um / I was just really / I was just pissed off / that’s all / like really it was just all emotions / I really / I didn’t know anything about the Middle East / I don’t / I really didn’t / I was in eighth grade / I don’t know

[S23] Yea 

[S24] That’s why I think it was really a kind of like an irrational move on their behalf 

[S21] Yea 

[S24] And it didn’t really put a plan together / and just to / sort of appease the American people / they knew they had to do something / and that’s why it’s just out of order right now

[S21] Yea

[S23] And I think they really played on those kinds of emotions in people / like everyone felt that way after 9-11 / and the government comes along and they’re like / we can do something about it

[S24] At the same time / the emotions played on them 

[S21] Yea / and like you said / the person at / like on the top is gonna want to keep them / their people happy

[S23] Yea

[S21] And the one thing that was gonna keep us happy was / us / going over there / and / doing whatever / and that’s what they did

[S22] [Inaudible] for / for years

[S21] Yea

[S22] And we still haven’t secured the [inaudible]

[S21] Exactly / it’s pointless

[S22] There’s still dudes digging tunnels and little cubby holes in the mountains and we’re just like sitting around the mountains / like / they’re up there somewhere / oh / it’s a shell / better watch out for that / like

[S21] Uh – huh / yea / getting bombed

[S23] So what made them think it would work better / if / we’ve already been there / we know the situation / and we know like / how they fight / we know the land is going to be like / working against us / the whole time / the people / how did that sound like a good idea in the first place? Like / other than emotionally

[S24] Exactly / that’s why I think it was pretty irrational and based on emotions

[S23] Yea

[S22] Yea / but / Saddam Hussein was a nut job anyways

[S23] Yea [laughter]

[S22] Like / he didn’t / when we attacked / he was like / he / he was just delusional / like he buried his fighter jets in the sand cause he thought he was gonna have to fight us / no / he thought was gonna have to crush / yo / first of all / he buried his fighter jets in the sand so that he could use them after he won / the war / and / the bridges that go into Baghdad over the river / the U.S. all thought he was gonna blow them up and booby trap them / no / he kept them there so that after he won the war he could suppress an uprising in the south of Iraq / and as a result we were just like / psht / ok / and we just rolled over the tanks / and rolled right into Baghdad 

[S21] Wow [laughter]

[S22] And like / like he was just a wacko

[S22] But just cause he’s a wacko / does that mean we / should’ve / taken him out

[S24] Yea

[S22] Well then we have a lot of wackos to take out / we should get cracking / yea

[S21] Yea / we’ve got a long list

[S22] We do

[S23] I gotta go back to the whole / it’s not our job / thing / I mean / it is our / it’s our responsibility to / work towards it 

[S21] It’s only our responsibility cause in the end it’s gonna effect us / cause if they do get anymore out of control / they’re / it’s gonna come back and 

[S23] Well yea / I mean / right / and those people deserve like / a better life than they had under Saddam Hussein

[S21] Right / but I mean / I don’t understand why it has to be just us

[S24] Exactly / so / whose gonna help them?

[S23] Yea / but to go in / just as us / I mean

[S24] It wasn’t just us initially [inaudible]

[S21] Initially 

[S22] Coalition of the willing 

[S23] Yea right / there weren’t too many / willing / from what I understood

[S24] Not too many are capable / I suppose

[S21] Do you guys think they’re gonna / um / I’ve been hearing / like / people might do like / the draft again / or whatever / do you think that would ever happen?

[S22] The reason / why / like one of the big reasons why they proposed reinstating the draft / this is a quote from / I don’t know what senator / but he said / that he proposed the bill to reinstate the draft / so that / he could get college students off of their IPods and onto the streets to end the war / just like they did in the 60’s / that’s why he proposed that though / cause if they proposed a draft [laughter] who would go? No / like some people would go

[S21] Well / you’d have to / wouldn’t you?

[S22] Well some people would go / but / college kids / especially / would blow up / and that’s nothing new 

[S24] What other rules as far as the draft / do you have to go as a college student?

[S22] They / they draw all the days of the year out of a hat / and the first one they draw / you’re gonna get drafted / the last one they draw / like / if that’s your birthday / you’re gonna get drafted 

[S24] Right right right

[S22] if they draw your birthday

[S21] Even if you’re in college?

[S24] I just mean as far as the stipulations to get out of it

[S22] The stipulations to get out of it / you can be a conscientious objector / you can flee / or / or / in the 60s / you could do it on academic grounds / which basically meant if you were rich enough to go to college / you could  
[S21] Yea / but that’s different / now / I think / nowadays

[S23] That’s like everyone you are drafting

[S24] There are so many more kids in college today.

[S22] but / yea / there’s so many more kids in college / and all the college kids would / that / that would / that would give us / like then we would start giving a shit about the Middle East

[S21] Yea

[S22] Like / I / I’m actually / I think they should reinstate the draft / I / I really do

[S21] Do you?

[S22] Yea / because / that would

[S21] So you’re saying we should stay over there?

[S22] That would get people to wake the fuck up

[S21] Yea / yea

[S22] Because then / because then / it wouldn’t just be / like / oh / it’s someone else’s problem / it’s across the world / oh / well / three more dudes died this morning

[S24] [Inaudible] like what we were just talking about [laughter] 

[S22] Suicide bombing in a marketplace / anyone want to go to Primo’s?

[S21] Yea [laughter]

[S22] It wouldn’t be like that / it would be like / this is bullshit / we’re not gonna take it 

[S21] Yea

[S22] Ya know?

[S24] Granted / it doesn’t take a draft to do that to everybody

[S22] Well / it might / it might

[S24] That’s ridiculous

[S21] Some people it would 

[S23] Yea 

[S21] But then again / that’s just more people that you’re sending over there / and / I / I still don’t see the point / in just staying over there / really / I don’t know / I think they’re just beyond screwed up / especially if we’re just gonna end up doing it alone / there’s absolutely no way / that’s possible 

[S22] Like / like / we should get rid of all the nutjobs and wackos who kill people / but who’s gonna pay for it 

[S21] Uh-huh

[S22] I mean / someone should get rid of ‘em / we can all agree someone should get rid of ‘em / but / but / would you / would you work 40 hours a week / and / and give up / like / all your money / just a hypothetical situation / and give up all your money in taxes / to go get rid of all the wackos in the world

[S24] All my money?

[Laughter]

[S22] I mean / like / that’s probably what it would take

[S21] No

[S22] Cause it would take a lot / it would take a lot that we / ya know / we might think we have it but we don’t have it

[S24]  [Inaudible]

[S21] Just us / right / that’s the thing

[S24] But there’s a lot of wealth in here that just seems to be beyond moderation / that / just like / I mean / us going to Loyola College right now / 40 grand a year / and / that just seems ridiculous

[S22] No / it / it is / but / but / if / if / someone was to take all that money / and then make a military / and then go get rid of all the wackos / you’d basically live in / a dictatorial military state / and then who gets to decide who’s the wackos / cause then / then you have a whole country where all anyone wants to do is fight / and then / who gets to decide / what / what battles we pick / how we fight them / how we do that / we would be fighting all of the time

[S21] I just / just going back to why we have to be the only one’s / I mean / like / there are / wackos in every country / but / I mean / like / Great Britain isn’t even in there / anymore / it’s / it is just us / I mean / I don’t understand why / we / are the only people / who / care about what’s going on / everywhere else / it’s gonna affect the rest of them eventually
[S22] Well / it’s our problem right now

[S21] It is our problem / but / it’s going / if it keeps going on / or if we pull out / and / even the countries in / uh / like / Africa / like / the / wackos there / like it’s gonna get crazier / I don’t understand why everyone else doesn’t care about that / like any other country that has the resources obviously

[S22] If we pullout / I honestly think they’ll keep on fighting amongst themselves

[S21] Oh [laughter] / yea / definitely / I really don’t think that’s ever gonna stop [laughter]

[S23] Nothing will change

[S22] I mean like / all the people say / well / like / it will become a safe haven for terrorists / well / duh / you blow people’s houses up / they’re going to hate you 

[S21] [Laughter] Yea 

[S22] Like / I know a kid who goes here / he’s from / um / Serbia / a couple of kids who go here from Serbia / and they’re like / yo / I love living in the United States / I got / ya know / I’ll live comfortably / I go to school with awesome people / I’m getting a great education / but when you guys bombed my neighborhood / yea / I fucking hated all of you

[S21] Uh-huh

[S22] At the time

[S21] Uh-huh

[S22] Ya know / it’s just irrational emotions / like we were talking about before / like / the reason that we went in to begin with

[S21] Yea / that’s true

[S23] No / I totally support getting rid of all the wackos and I totally support taking action / it’s just / one country against the world / and that sets us up even more / is this / this power that / like / some Iraqi’s have painted us as / like the / the guys who just come in / and like / take over everything / and / just force their own way on other people / and / I mean / we need the support of other / we need the visibly and economic support of other countries / to / be able to keep doing this

[S21] Uh-huh

[So do you guys feel like it’s gone on long enough? Or do you feel like it should be ended? Or just discuss your thoughts on that]

[S21] Um / the only / I don’t know / I mean / it definitely has gone on long enough / definitely / too many lives have been lost / it’s just / it doesn’t / work itself out / but / um / I feel like if we pullout / like / the chances of another terrorist attack just shoot up / I don’t know

[S24] Yea / I think there’s a good argument on either side / of the 

[S21] Yea

[S24] One way / it’s just eating away at us domestically but on the other side / if we / pullout / it’s just gonna build right back up the way it used to be

[S21] Uh-huh

[S24] I mean / we broke it down / something’s gotta get it going on the right path

[S23] Yea / but / I / mean / we’ve been trying to get it on the right path and nothing’s really changed / I mean / we’ve been having like / the elections over there and stuff / but / in the neighborhoods / things are still going the same way / I mean / people are still shooting each other / and / there’s still the same amount of tension and political unrest / and

[S24] That’s true / but / I mean / it’s really not a reason to say / alright / go back to the way it was

[S22] Yea

[S24] Just because we haven’t gotten it right yet / I mean / we haven’t found a cure for AIDS yet / but were probably not going to give up for that

[S22] Like you break it you buy it

[S23] But

[S22] And we broke it / and now we bought it / and 

[S24] I’m not saying I have the answer for how to finish it off

[S22] Oh / no / no

[S24] But I don’t also / I mean / I don’t have an answer either way

[S23] No / I agree

[S24] You could defend each argument pretty well

[S23] I agree we have a responsibility to do something / but / until someone comes up with a plan / I mean

[S24] Exactly / it’s just eating away at our resources

[S23] Didn’t President Bush declare the war over? Like a long time ago

[S24] I don’t know about that

[S22] Yea

[S23] Like / a couple years ago

[S22] Once we hit Baghdad pretty much

[S23] Yea 

[S22] But I mean like / do you know how hard it is to build a country / you have to get millions of people to all agree / on a lot of things

[S23] Yea

[S22] And if they’ve hated each other / for almost 1000 years

[S21] And when they’re fighting with each other / that doesn’t help

[S22] Right / yea / yea 

[S23] Especially when / it’s not our culture too / and we’re trying to go in and fix it

[S21] Yea

[S22] Yea / I mean / and people say we went in for oil / we didn’t go in for oil 

[S21] Yea

[S22] The Iraqi oil industry is in shambles / they can’t do shit right now

[S21] And that’s what makes them even more up

[S23] Yea

[S21] Like when we go in there / like / we’re / like / we’re messing with their culture / like / we’re / we’re getting in the way of all that / and that makes them even more angry / and makes them hate us / so / they’re obviously not going to do what we want them do

[S23] Right

[S21] So

[S22] Like / you’re from the city right?

[S21] Um / Long Island

[S22] You’re from Long Island / but when you go into the city / you take a bridge / you take the Queensboro Bridge or something like that / yea / imagine if / in addition to waiting inline for the toll booth / you had to wait in line / almost like you’re crossing the border into Canada / and there’s a checkpoint / and they / needed ID from everyone in the car / and they searched you / imagine what a nightmare it would be / to get from Long Island to New York

[S21] Yea / I couldn’t imagine

[S22] That’s why a lot of Iraqi’s despise us / is because / we like / for security reasons / we setup like all these checkpoints / which I guess work / cause we net all these criminals that we’re looking for / but / they hate / if you’re trying to get to work / you’re trying to commute to work / and / you have to commute through a checkpoint / and there’s like a five hour wait at the checkpoint

[S21] I mean / there’s not other way [laughter]

[S22] Yea

[S21] There really isn’t

[S24] We still deal with that at home with the airports / right / but not quite as extreme / but 

[S22] But / if you break it / you buy it / and / I / I just think next time before we / we break something / we should / really / really / do the homework first

[S24] [Inaudible] / finance it 

[Laughter]

[S23] Yea

[S22] To see what it’s gonna be

[S23] I think we should’ve / I almost think we should’ve waited longer to go into the whole thing / until people’s / emotions / kind of settled down / cause / everyone was so so gung-ho about it / and you should never be that / I don’t know

[S21] I didn’t / I don’t think / I think we should have waited to make a decision

[S23] Yea
[S21] I don’t think we should have waited to go in / if / I mean / we were gonna go in / I feel like / we should’ve gone it

[S23] Right

[S21] But / I’m not sure if we should’ve gone in [Laughter]

[S23] Right / that’s the thing / yea / we should have waited to decide whether or not to go all out / and how much we wanted to do / and how much time we wanted to spend there

[S21] Yea / definitely / uh-huh

[S23] I mean / you can never tell everything ahead of time / but / it doesn’t seem like we really had a place

[S21] No

[S24] No / not at all

[S22] Well / we didn’t really anticipate all of this / I mean / we had a plan / kind of / but like / I mean / I think in the end / what I think / could / definitely happen / is like / Condoleezza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld / are gonna / fall on their own swords / if you know what I mean / they’re gonna be like / alright / yea / it was our bad / sorry / it was our fault

[Laughter]

[S21] Um

[So what do you think about that / like / in the end / what might happen?]

[Laughter]

[S21] Um / I just feel / that about the draft / I feel / if we / if you were gonna reinstate that / I feel like / the only / to get people’s attention / yea / bring up the idea of it / but / I / I really / I don’t think it’s a good idea

[S24] Yea / that wouldn’t go over well at all / I mean / you talked about

[S21] Yea / absolutely not

[S24] being a good leader / you gotta please the people / all the people who would be in that draft / I like / imagine the vast majority / have nothing to do with it

[S22] Yea / but that’s / that’s the purpose of instating the draft / because / right now 

[S24]  Force them to think about it?

[S22] Nobody gives a shit / nobody cares / if you walk around on Maryland Hall / and you ask people / what happened this morning in Baghdad / there / there could be like / four families that got blown up this morning / like families / mothers / daughters / kids / and / they got blown up cause of all this violence which is going on / and I’m not saying it’s our fault / it’s not our fault these families got blown up / but like / that’s important / and nobody here gives a shit / like / a kid from my high school went down in a helicopter in Afghanistan this summer

[S21] Yep

[S22] And like / that was the first time / that anyone in my town / even / like / looked up from their coffee and doughnuts

[S23] picked up a newspaper

[S22] to see that there was a war going on / cause nobody cares / cause we’re real comfortable / and cause we have a great country to live in / with a lot of great things going for us economically / so we don’t have to care

[S21] And we’re far away from it / and we don’t know anything

[S22] So / we’re / it’s like that way right now

[S23] But

[S21] We’re like Loyola in Baltimore / [Laughter]

[S22] Yea

[S24] But at the same time we have / At the same time / not to downplay that / cause I completely agree / maybe four families die over there / but you think / probably like / hundreds of families die here / [inaudible] / poverty / or / something that we could take of here

[S22] Yea

[S24] I mean / what are we doing to raise awareness to that? Some sort of poverty draft to force them to think about it / what are we doing on our own turf as well?

[S22] We’re / I mean / yea / why / shouldn’t social issues take priority?

[S24] I agree we should have awareness here just as much as we should have / Yea 

[S22] They should / I agree / they should take priority / but / they’re not gonna take priority because / that would be socialism [laughter] / and / poor people are lazy / and / all this stuff / and / that’s / and those things aren’t gonna take priority / like / a couple space shuttle missions / that amount of money could probably end homelessness in America / but / it’s not gonna happen / because the people who have the money / like the 1% who control 46% of American assets / they don’t want to give that up cause they feel so entitled to it / they feel like they worked for it

[S21] Some of them did

[S23] Yea

[S22] Well / and / and / a lot of them did / but / a lot of them made it by / really really really really really working hard / doing things like / cutting costs / which is an impersonal way of saying / paying the people / like / it was just basically an impersonal way of saying / squeezing the lower end of the pay scale / taking bonuses at the top / and increasing your revenues / like / I’m not / even if those people did work really really hard / it’s not their fault / it was just their objective to / to make money / and they did so / by like concentrating it

[S23] No / that’s true / like / everyone / like / I don’t mean to be down on Bill Gates or anything / but / everyone celebrates him so much cause he donates to all these charities and stuff / he gives like a million away / but / I mean 

[S21] It’s like nothing to him

[S23] To Bill Gates / a million dollars is like

[S21] It’s like a dollar

[S23] Yea [laughter]

[S22] I mean / he

[S23] So / I mean / he’s setting a good example / but

[S21] But [laughter] to him / it’s nothing

[S23] Yea

[S22] Right / the only way / I / I will respect Bill Gates if he does what Rockefeller did / and if he does what Warren Buffet did 

[S24] Exactly

[S22] And when he dies / he’s like / fuck it / take all of it

[S21] Uh-huh

[S23] Yea

[S22] I don’t even want it / just / put it somewhere good / cause when you’re talking about that amount of money / you can / you can do something 

[S23] Yea

[S24] Yea / I agree with the whole Warren Buffet thing / just giving up the entire estate / keeping enough / probably / a little bit more than enough to live comfortable

[S22] Yea

[S24] But still / there was a ton left over / to help out society

[S22] Oh yea

[S21] Yea

[S22] I mean / yea / I guess Bill Gates / just rode the computer wave all the way to the top / cause he got on early and he was like / PCs are gonna be huge in like ten years 

[Laughter]

[S23] I don’t / there’s / one thing I don’t understand is / a lot of / I’ve heard a lot of people compare the war in Iraq to Vietnam / and / but / what you said is true / nobody cares about the war in Iraq / but / the war in Vietnam / everyone was protesting / and / there was so much going on / but was the / was everyone here that uncomfortable in the 70s / that made it that much bigger a deal

[S22] They were / towards the end of the war / they got real sick of it

[S23] Right / but / I mean / that’s / what’s supposed to be / if this is like Vietnam / and we see the same thing happening / and so many people are saying / hey / it’s Vietnam all over again / why / still doesn’t anyone care?

[S21] Did the war in Vietnam effect / like / like did it effect / like / the U.S more / like 

[S22] There were a lot more casualties

[S21] At home-wise more / yea / well yea / but

[S22] A lot more causalities / and also / like / we / we had a president at the time / who did like / great things / socially / along the lines of the social problems / like / we wouldn’t have Medicare or Medicaid if it wasn’t for LBJ / but / like / everyone pointed their finger at him / and said / this is your fault / you bastard / when in reality / like JFK was the one who really / in / in terms of like / in terms of the denominator by which / or in terms of the coefficient by which people raise the [inaudible] when they came into office and left / JFK came in with like 200 military advisors / of  the 12 / and then got assassinated / and then / LBJ / just like / took off / and then / finally Nixon came in / and like / and [inaudible] / but like / I don’t know / people just got fed up with it / and we’re not that way yet / we could be / if / if it really drags on / people could very easily get sick of it / the other thing was the draft 

[S21] Yea

[S22] The draft mobilized / our demographic at the time

[S21] Yea / I mean 

[S22] Ask your parents about it.

[S21] Yea / I’m sure the draft definitely got like / that age group more involved / but / um 

[S23] Yea

[S21] I don’t know

[S22] Absolutely / these are questions that just don’t have answers

[Laughter]

[S23] That’s true
