CATHOLIC CHURCH

[Is everyone ready to begin? Ok. In your opinion, does the Catholic Church need to change its ways to adapt to life in the 21st century? Anyone want to begin?]

[S14] I guess I’ll begin.

[Ok]

[S14] Um / so what it’s saying / um / the Roman Catholic Church has been longstanding / like / the example / orthodox [inaudible] in the Christian religion / and / I don’t know / I feel like there are a lot of other religions or more progressive people / there are a lot more like branches / sects / of Christianity / for progressive people / um / and I personally would never become / like Roman Catholic / or anything / but 

[S16] Yea / I feel like it’s / like a lot of their stuff is outdated / um / they’re not really keeping up with / with like society / and / like tendencies / um / I don’t know / they / they just seem to stick to / the Bible too much / which is like / obviously / old / and / kinda outdated I guess / I don’t know

[S13] I don’t / um / I don’t know if I agree with that / I don’t know if they stick with the Bible but more with like / the laws of like / the counsel of [inaudible] 
[S16] Yea
[S13] and like things from way back when / but just to clarify something that you said / were you trying to say like / that / you / you don’t really think it should change because the Catholic Church is the one thing that has been constant like / they’ve kept their / their laws / so you’d think that you’d want different rules and stuff / something that’s not quite so outdated you should just go to a different church / is that what you were kinda saying?

[S14] um / well / personally / I’m not really a religious person at all / like / I don’t really believe in religion / um / but like / as far as like the influence of the Roman Catholic Church / like / I mean / I feel like within / like / a religion / whether be like Christianity / um / Judaism / um / Islam / I mean / I think there should be dialogue between / ya know/ those more fundamentalist groups and the more progressive groups / and I / I mean / if you don’t have that dialogue then / like / there’s nothing / like you / can’t move forward kinda / you can’t make decisions / um / I mean / it’s the same with like politics / you have to have liberals and you have to have conservatives because if you don’t / like / it’s not going to work / like I feel like that dialogue is necessary / but / at the same time / the Roman Catholic Church is so / influential / over / like / Christianity and / I mean / just the world in general / that I feel / um / I guess I do feel that / either it has to be more progressive or like not / like / lose some of it’s influence I guess 

[inaudible]
[laughter]

[S15] um / I don’t really know what to say / I / I guess the whole point that I was taught about the Catholic Church / was that / because it is old and ancient and has remained the same / it’s one of those things that’s like constant / kinda like the rising and setting of the sun / and that / it has actually gone through a lot of changes through / out of the years / like with the corrupt bishops and popes and everything / and / like / new laws will be put into effect / um / like / cause I do know that / they could marry / priest’s could marry and have families and then / when the corruption happened they made the rule that they couldn’t anymore / and / I think nowadays there are some things that can change / like / um / I think we’ve gotten past the part of corruption / and I think priests should probably be allowed to marry / um / and I think that / they should maybe / I guess / I think they should have / the ability to change some laws / like become more modern / like / they should allow women to become priests rather than just always nuns / but / other than like changes in that sense / I like / how / some things can stay constant / like / yea / you say the bible is outdated / but in a way it’s not / because / you can also apply it to nowadays life than just have the modern view of it / I don’t know / a lot of sermons or masses I’ve been to have / taken like the old readings and then taken like life examples now and they find a median / in a way it’s modern in that sense but it also has other changes / it’s structures that kinda could be changed / I don’t know if that makes any sense at all / but
[laughter]

[S16] um / I think that’s like / like / like if you say / like the priests like give / when they give a sermon on like a bible passage or something / if they like try to make it up to date / that’s just their interpretation / and / it’s not / it doesn’t have to be like / what the writers of the bible intended / and it’s just like / it’s just like the same thing with the Constitution / like people interpret it different ways / and like / no one knows what’s really right / so it / it could have  just been that it was written / just / just for like that time / but like we just kept it around and tried to just interpret it to make it seem like it’s still relevant

[S13] but isn’t that like true of any literary work / 

[S16] Yea
[S15] Yea
[S13] that you can just interpret it however

[S16] Yea / that’s why I don’t know why the bible is so like 

[S15] I feel like it’s a good foundation to work off of / but I don’t think it should be changed

[S16] I guess

[Laughter]
[S16] Yea no / it shouldn’t be changed
[S15] Like I’m not gonna go in there and be / oh I don’t like this sentence / let me cross out these words and add my own

[S16] no / if that’s what people want to believe / like if they just like religion because of it’s like history / and / how it’s been around for / so long / and they just want to be a part of that I guess / I don’t know / I guess that’s alright / but / I don’t really want a part in it / I don’t know / I just can’t / believe everything in it

[S14] And when I think / um / ya know / the religious texts / of / any religion have to be understood in the context of their time period / I mean / I think the Catholic Church is probably doing a little better job at it then like / let’s say the more religiously fundamental Islam groups / um / who where like if you look inside the Koran you can find / stuff about polygamy / and / um / uh / things like / um / like slavery and stuff that you can find in the Koran but the more fundamental groups are like / refusing to / like they feel like / a critically analyzing a word of
G-d should be forbidden / so / um / I guess in that respect the Catholic Church is doing a somewhat better job of it / also because / um / they don’t believe the bible is the word / like / of G-d like the Muslims do / so / 

[S16] well like / since they / since they / the Catholic Church decided to / I guess add the new testament to the old testament / and / it’s like / there’s a lot of different teaching in there / like I guess that was kind of an update / but / it still / I don’t know / it’s still kinda like / that makes the whole book contradictory I think / like / and / people just interpret it like the way they want / I don’t know if anybody could judge if it’s right or not

[S13] I guess that’s why there are different religions / and sects of religions / because / not everyone is obviously going to agree on everything / and I know I have / some friends back home / that are like / Baptist and there are so many different branches of Baptists and some of them take every single word in the bible literal / like / I had this one teacher and she swore the fish drowned / from like the flood / none of the rest of us who were in her class could understand how do fish drown / and we just didn’t see eye to eye on that one
[Laughter]
[S13] and so then like / I guess it’s like there’s different religions / thoughts / whatever for every person / and you just / you either don’t choose to be a part of it because you don’t want to or / you / which is fine / or you find one that you like / which is also fine / and like / I guess one thing I like about the Catholic Church / is that / if you don’t agree with them they’re not gonna / oh / you’re going to hell / they’re just like ok that’s fine / we’ll accept your opinion / which a lot of times people don’t realize / and I / but I like how they’re modern in that sense / and they’ve kinda always been that way from what I’ve heard actually 

[S15] And / is that true though / I mean / the way / I read this article / um / just like / a week ago / my roommate was reading it to me / it was in like the Baltimore Sun / and it was about / how / like politicians who supported gay marriage or who were pro-choice / like / the new pope was trying to write some sort of thing that was going to forbid them from receiving communion / and like / that’s one thing that I / like with the Catholic Church / that / I feel like they’re kinda like you have to accept everything that we say / which there’s like a whole lot of rules / or like / ya know / like you’re not a true Catholic / I don’t know / like what those laws are
[Laughter]

[S13] I don’t really know either / like / I’m gonna be like / the first one to say I definitely don’t agree everything the pope says / and / maybe that makes me less of a Catholic / but / I don’t know / from everything I’ve heard / from teachers I’ve had / and / the past like / it’s if / if you have different feelings or different thoughts / it’s always been accepted / I / like I know my dad went to a Catholic school / I’ve never been to Catholic school / I guess Loyola kinda is / and he said like / always the nuns / were always like telling him / you should always accept other people’s religions and other people’s thoughts / and respect them for what they have and what they believe in even though it’s different / and like / I don’t know / maybe like / the pope / in a way / I kinda feel like / he shouldn’t be / the ultimate say in like everything / like / this is what I think / this is what should happen / I don’t agree with everything that goes on there / because / like you said / like / some of the laws he’s trying to get passed / like I don’t really know / does / do other people have to accept and like / vote / and agree with him

[S15] no / I mean / I guess it’s like the infallibility of the pope / that like if he / like / puts out some / I don’t know what they’re called / [inaudible] / I don’t know / something / he writes some sort of / message and / I mean / the church is still very political / our pope now is very ultra conservative and / so / that’s moving the Catholic Church / like as the whole / he’s then / because of his beliefs he’s moving it more / to be more conservative / and like / after such like a long / reign of Pope John Paul / who was like / trying to / like get things to be a little more

[S13] medium like

[S15] Yea / and we’re not gonna use the word like liberal / because / I think liberal and Catholic are kinda
[S13] kinda don’t go together

[S15] but / um / so / yea / I don’t know

[S13] yea / um / I don’t know / I agree with that / it also / it really has to deal with like who’s in charge at that particular time and / I like it how / it’s not gonna stay the same always / like whoever else is elected / they could be like / oh / well / I don’t think this person got right / so like / we can tweak it / so I guess it’s modern in a sense that way / kinda like presidents nowadays / right? You get a new president every so many terms and some things not working you just like tweak

[S16] I think that’s like the problem with it though / like if / like if the Catholic Church’s goal is to spread the gospel of Jesus then if they wanted to do that they wouldn’t have to be as power hungry as they are now / like it’s turning into a business / right now / it’s like the pope is the president and then / there’s all the workers / the priests / who like teach what / what they say / and that’s why they have to say like if you don’t believe us / you’re wrong / and they have to keep to that / or else / people wouldn’t / I don’t know / I guess give them money / and I guess keep going to church
[Laughter]
[S16] So / like / if their main point is to get their message across / I think they could do it without / being the way they are / so preaching and / I don’t know / like if they just wanted to say / like read Jesus’ teaching and try to like incorporate them into your life / they don’t have to like setup the whole hierarchy that just like tries to control everything

[S14] yea / um / like / on a side note / it’s kinda related to that / like / just like / as a religion in general / like / I don’t feel that there should be like / this kinda buffer / this kinda like / these people that are in between you and your relationship with G-d / ya know / people who say you have to do this / you have to receive communion and from like / I don’t even know / I’m not Catholic / but / ya know / have all these people who tell you what to believe / and like / I don’t know / they’re just coming in between you and G-d / and / I just don’t feel that’s

[S15] they’re not really coming in between you and G-d / they’re just like there if you want them / and / no one’s forcing you to take communion / no one’s forcing you to like / believe everything that they say / I definitely don’t believe everything that they say / and / I’m / like / still a Catholic / I still consider myself a Catholic / but / probably more of like / the modern type of Catholic / if that’s what you’re getting at / um / and like / I guess like in other words / the reason why / the main reason why we have a pope / from my understanding / it’s just to like / make sure that / all the churches across the nations are teaching the same passages that same Sunday / is that correct? And then like they’re not gonna tell like every individual priest / this is how you say you say the sermon / this is what you have to say / and like this is how you’re gonna relate it to life / they’re like / this is what we’re teaching / go at it
[Laughter] / I mean

[S14] well / I mean / and I don’t have a problem with that / um / if / ya know / people are free to believe whatever they way

[S15] right 

[S14] but / I mean / I guess my problem comes with the / amount of influence that the Catholic Church has / um / I mean / you look at the Catholic Church versus the world council of churches / and like / um / the influence of the Catholic Church is much greater and it’s growing / like 

[S15] It’s also been around for years though / so like / that also has a huge part of it 
[S14] well / true / but

[S15] if something’s been around for so long / it’s gonna influence something

[S14] although it has been like / growing exponentially / like now / in regions that / for / ya know / Christianity wasn’t / like especially in like Latin America / and Africa right now / I mean / the Catholic Church is kinda gaining a / I guess a monopoly over / people’s souls / I don’t know / like / I just feel like there should be more equality / between those who believe in / ya know / progressive ideas / and the Catholic Church

[S16] [inaudible] I feel like a lot of people just like / they just like to consider themselves Catholic / even though like / there’s a lot of people who don’t go to church every Sunday / they don’t follow everything the church says / but / they still consider themselves Catholic / but that’s not really what the church considers Catholic / like / they want it to be a certain way / and / if you’re not fully in agreement with them / I don’t think you should / say that you’re Catholic / like you’re / whatever you believe / like I don’t / I just don’t like that placing like labels on everything / I don’t know / I just don’t see the point to it / and I think they’re taking control / they’re taking advantage of that / people believing that they have to agree with everything that they say / and / I don’t know / they’re using it / to / control people’s minds
[S15] I’m not gonna agree with you
[Laughter]
[S15] Definitely not agreeing with you / [laughter] / um / ok / so like we were saying in Africa and everything / I’m / they’re not killing other people / being like / oh / you’re not Catholic / we’re not gonna kill you / or / oh / you’re not Catholics / or we should convert you because you’re not / basically / if you want to listen to the message and then believe in it / that’s fine / and if you don’t / that’s fine / and like / it’s not / it’s not like they’re saying like / oh / well / you’re Jewish and you want to come teach Judaism to these people / we’re not gonna let you / they don’t do that / they let 

[S16] they couldn’t though / they would just get in trouble for that

[S15] um / no 

[S16] I think they’d watch themselves / like they’d make sure that they don’t anything too / too like / outlandish but / I don’t know / they / 

[S13] but what you’re saying / this is like a while back / when you were talking about / um / like / like the priests and people coming between an individual person and their relationship with G-d / but like / isn’t that the whole point / of organized religion / I mean / different people put it / or want that to play a different role in their life / so some people are perfectly fine to just have their own personal relationship with like a G-d or higher being or something / um / and not have any religion / but / religion / if you choose to follow a certain religion that has it’s own ideas and regulations and everything / it’s kind of more like / you choose the one that best helps you to get that relationship / with G-d

[S14] I mean / yea / I agree with you completely / I was just saying my personal beliefs

[S13] Ok

[S14] are like / I’m not going to join a religion because I don’t personally

[S13] that’s fine / I’m not gonna like / make you join a religion
[Laughter]
[S14] right / I’m just trying to give an idea of like / where I was coming from in this debate

[S13] ok

[S15] and / what you were saying about / like the Catholic Church / and that / like if you don’t like / follow everything / I would say like / that’s something / that / I’m like kind of confused about because / um / I mean / this is my fifteenth year of catholic school / like being in Loyola / and / I do not agree with everything that the Catholic Church says but / I / I don’t / I mean / even after fifteen years of being taught / like / the laws or whatever you want to say it / like / the Catholic Church / I still don’t know / does that / am I not Catholic then because I don’t agree with everything? I feel like / in some ways / that / you’re supposed to believe everything / but / that to me kinda seems ridiculous too
[S16] I don’t know / I think that’s how they are though / like / I just think they don’t want people to have a mind of their own / and go thinking / they just want you to come to church and / give them money / and 
[Laughter]

[S15] No / that’s not true
[Laughter]
[S15] Um / that’s like / all the churches I’ve been to / they / um / the priest has always said / that you can take what you want from the sermon / and apply it to your life in how you see fit / and / he like / they leave open doors for you to interpret how you want / which / that’s your thinking / it’s not someone saying like / this is how you should think / so / the message that they’re telling people is there / and like / it’s basically going to be the same message across everywhere / it’s up to the individual to take the message how they want / and interpret the message how they want / no one is going into your thoughts and being like / do it this way

[S16] No / I know that
[Laughter]

[S15] So / they’re really like they’re controlling your mind / it’s kinda like when you go to class

[S16] once you like / once you like lock onto that religion though / I think they can take advantage of you / I don’t know / that’s how I see it

[S15] well I mean like / I understand that cause like / a lot of people / that I know / see it that way

[S16] yea / there’s a lot of / there’s a lot of people even in this country that / just they’re / that’s all they care about is their religion / and the Catholic religion / and that’s / that’s just governs like everything they do in life / and / I don’t know / I just think its like / preventing people from thinking on their own / like rationally

[S15] no / I can understand what you’re saying / cause if you want / like if / if you just believe a certain thing because the church tells you to

[S16] Yea

[S15]  And you say like / oh / well / the Catholic Church says that / ya know / I don’t know / what / contraceptives are like / not

[S16] There’s plenty of people who do that.

[S15] Yea / so / but if you / just take everything and don’t think for yourself / then 

[S13] It’s like your own fault.

[S15] Yea / like if you choose to / I don’t know
[S13] and also / a lot of people I think use it to their excuse

[S15] right / I think that’s what I was just trying to / trying to say

[S13] yea / they’re like / oh / well / my religion doesn’t allow me to do this / so / I’m just gonna say that / but / it’s a total excuse / for like everything / I don’t know

[S14] Like / you mean an excuse to not have a real opinion?

[S13] yea / an excuse to not have a real opinion / like / oh well / someone once said this / ok / that’s what I’ll just say 

[S14] I guess that’s where like / I feel the Catholic Church’s influence is kind of a problem / like / especially like in the realm of politics / where / I mean / the south / is going to vote conservative / that’s not going to change / and / I would attribute a lot of that / well / ok / there’s like gun control and [laughter] all that / but / I would attribute a lot of it to the Catholic Church / and 

[S15] No / you can’t say that
[S13] But in the south / like the bible-belt / like / of Baptists and everything

[S15] Yea / I am southern / and that is so / no one is Catholic in the / sorry / I’m from the / sorry / no one is Catholic / I’m like / the minority / I did not know / I think I went to school with maybe five people that were Catholic / there were more Jews in the south than there were Catholics / so / I mean / everyone is Baptist / and like / there’s so many form of Baptism / I mean Baptists / I cant even keep track of it / and like / when I go to my friends churches / it’s / I like it cause it’s / a different way of teaching the same message / and / I mean like / it’s really funny cause / whenever / I go to someone’s church / I never expect it to be Catholic / and then like / the past weekend / I went with my friend to church and it was Catholic / and I was like / this is really weird [laughter] ok / so / I mean / you can’t say Catholicism is the cause / for the conservative thought of the south because / no one’s Catholic 

[S14] once I said it / I was like / wait
[laughter]
[S14] the south is like / primarily Baptist / like / um / yea / I guess / my point is just / religion in general holds too much of a sway over people

[S15] well / I mean / then again / that’s also other people’s opinions / like / I know you’re not religious / and that’s fine / I know tons of people that aren’t / and / I mean like / I think / a lot / I think the tides will turn / like / right now / people who are religious are in like power / so you hear about it / maybe a few years from now people who are in power aren’t religious / and you’ll hear about that / I mean / it’s always changing / it’s like / whatever people / it’s always changing

[S13] if you take away all of like / the specific rules of the Catholic Church / or of any church is general / you can still be left with basic morals that govern people’s lives / regardless of like specific things
[S15] Yea

[S13] oh / you shouldn’t have anything to eat before like / an hour before communion / like that’s totally a manmade law that changed and those are the kinds of things

[S15] I totally eat

[S13] I’m kind of just / think are ridiculous

[S15] Yea

[S13] they were not made my G-d / they were made by people in some council however many years ago / so / but if you / if you look at just the basic morals that govern peoples lives / those could be what are deciding whether / ya know / they / what sort of things they believe politically as well / so you / not necessarily just the Catholic Church

[S15] yea / no / I agree with that / totally / cause like 

[S16] [inaudible]

[S15] go ahead.

[S16] you could go.

[S15] no / you go first.

[S16] like / if you just believe in the morals that it teaches / like / that’s not really Catholicism / that’s just like / just like reading a philosophy book / like / Confucianism or something / it’s just like reading that / like / but / when they say like / when they say that / I don’t know / yea / like
[Laughter]
[S16] I don’t want to get into that. Uh / Yea / I don’t know / that’s how I feel 

[S15] That’s fine

[So what do you think about allowing priests to marry or allowing female priests? In regards to accusations of pedophilia and things like that?]

[S13] well I think priests should be allowed to marry / like I think a lot of people / well / I think that religious vocations / like the Catholic Church is definitely losing people who are interested in becoming priests / this might be like really random but / I know that / you see this in like old movies or old books or something / where the dad would be like / oh if you’re bad I’m gonna send you to the convent and stuff like that / so some people might not have chosen to become nuns and they were kind of like forced into it which might be why a lot of nuns are really grumpy
[Laughter]
[S13] Um / I think that / also / with / homosexuality being / more / like it’s more acceptable / like you can say that you’re gay / whereas / I don’t know / say fifty years ago / you / if you weren’t going to get married because you were gay / people would be like / why are you not married?  Like it was / more / basically common that you were either supposed to get married or become a priest / like it was / it would be strange / so I think that people went into it maybe / for the wrong reasons and if / somebody really felt strongly that they wanted to be a priest but also wanted to have a family I think that it would be a good move for the Catholic Church also / and the priest would be able to relate more to the congregation if they actually have families / and / I don’t know / I think it would be a good move

[S15] yea / and I totally agree with that / cause / um / like actually / my dad has a friend who wanted to be a priest but he also wanted a family / so he chose family

[S16] Isn’t it in like Lutheran / Lutheranism / you could like / you could / um / the preachers could get married / and it’s like / it’s similar to the Catholic Church

[S13] Yea / it’s very similar

[S16] Like / I don’t know / wouldn’t that just be like another option / I guess the Catholic Church is more powerful than / than them right now

[S15] well also / I think / I don’t know if Lutheranism has the same message taught across / the nations / I know / Episcopalians do / they’ll have the same scriptures taught across everywhere / and Catholic do but / I don’t think Lutherans do / I could be wrong on that aspect

[S16] I don’t know.

[S15] But I think / a lot of people / that is another option / I mean / but / I don’t think a lot of people know about it as much / and also / people like to know that the same things / gonna be taught if you’re in an AP class and you’re gonna be taught / like / a certain chapter in a textbook / I don’t know / that was like a really poor analogy
[Laughter]
[S15] But 

[S13] no / I agree / I think we should marry / be able / I think there are some changes that could happen.

[S14] um / I’m not too familiar with like / some of the [inaudible] of the Catholic faith / but / um / like / what / like / the specific reasoning behind them not being allowed to marry / is it just like they should be devoted completely to G-d?

[S15] I think that it was Jesus wasn’t married / so

[S13] And also that was like

[S16] It’s like a sign of their devotion to G-d

[S13] Yea / and also / it happened like / pre / there were popes and priests that were married / way back when / and then all this corruption started happening / like / they paid more attention to their families / they like didn’t really do anything much with their priesthood and that’s when they made the law / they’re like / oh / well / you’re kinda neglecting your job and your duties / so / from now on / you can’t get married and devote yourself to G-D

[S14] I think it’s just interesting cause now / like / the opposite is kind of happening / and now the fact that they can’t marry / is causing them to be more corrupt and sin

[S13] Sorry

[S14] I feel like if they had the option to marry / I mean / I’m not gonna jump in and say that the Catholic Church should change the way it does things / I mean / I have no say whatsoever in this religion / but / ya know / I feel that that would help / I mean / the priests / who are not like Jesus / because no can be like Jesus / because he was like / [inaudible] perfect sinless person / I don’t know.

[S13] um / well

[S16] that’s like / oh / you can go 

[S13] are you sure? [laughter] um / this might be like / too random / but / um / with all the stuff / like the DiVinci Code / and all that stuff that / you don’t know if it’s true or not / but / the fact that Jesus might have been married / I think that / then that kind of / could possibly like take away the reasoning that / if it turns out Jesus really was married / then / like now why can’t priests get married / so 

[S15] Yea

[S16] No / I think it was like / what I was saying before / like / when I said / um / you either like agree with the Catholic Church or not / if you’re thinking about becoming a priest / like / since the Catholic Church shouldn’t have to change / like / if you’re thinking about becoming at Catholic priest / you should / if you’re not willing to / not / to give up your right to get married / then / you shouldn’t be part of that Catholic Church / if that’s something that they want to be part of their religion / like / that’s just how they are I guess / and / shouldn’t be part of it if you don’t agree with that

[S13] I guess that’s going back to what you said before / at least what I was taking from what you said before about if / if instead of / trying to change the Catholic Church / if / you believe something different then you should just join a different religion / and / maybe that’s what you were saying about like Lutheran

[S16] Yea

[S13] So / I don’t know / it’s / I guess that’s / I keep bringing that up because that’s something that I didn’t really / think about / that / I guess I’m trying to think / like / that some of the things are just too outdated and should be changed / but / I guess somewhere you could find a religion that has changed those things / because that’s how / the / um / Lutheranism came about because Martin Luther / like nailed those things on the door 
[S15] [inaudible]
[S13] of the church that he didn’t like / then made up his religion that had / that changed those things / but I guess / what’s also interesting is that / the church has changed so much / over however many hundreds and thousands of years that it’s been around / and / but what’s changed have been / like people making different laws / so / if it’s / it has become corrupt and different things have changed so maybe / I don’t know where I was going with that / but / I don’t know / it has changed over the years

[S16] So you mean like maybe they will change it?

[S13] again / yea  

[S15] yea / because it doesn’t 

[S16] it’s possible but like why don’t they just change it now? Like why do they have to like [inaudible]

[S15] I mean / again / it’s kind of like / the whole / whoever is president / if they don’t agree it’s not gonna change right then / and / so / you have to wait for someone else to come in / and be like / oh / I’m hearing what the people want / and I’m gonna like listen to them / so 

[S16] Yea / the only thing / like the people don’t pick the pope / it’s not like the presidential election

[S13] Yea

[S16] It’s not like you read about what they stand for and pick them / it’s like / his like friends basically pick him / I don’t know / it’s not really / I know it’s not supposed to be a democracy but / like / it just doesn’t seem fair to everyone
