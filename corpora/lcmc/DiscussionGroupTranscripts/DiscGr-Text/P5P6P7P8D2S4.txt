GENDER DISCRIMINATION

[Is everyone ready to begin?]

[S7] Uh-huh

[S5] Yes

[Ok. Do you feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the present day United States, and if so what can we do to change this? Who would like to start?]

[S8] Alright / yea

[Laughter]

[S8] Alright / yea / I do think that it’s still an issue in the present day United States / I mean / you still see that there’s a difference in wages / like / different earnings and stuff like that / and / you still see all of these / um / stereotypical families that were / setup / I mean / back in like the 1950s / where you have the father who / goes out, goes to his business job / and then wife who stays at home and / like / takes care of the kids, cleans the house / or whatever while he’s gone / and / I mean / these still exist today in / in some places not a lot has changed / since / the / like back in the 50s when / suburban like housing started becoming really popular / and / it started portraying all these images of the family / on / through commercials / and / through television and stuff / and I just think that in some places not much has really changed / where as in others you do see more women getting out into the workplace and everything like that / and everything / starts to like / it’s picking up pace gradually / but / I still don’t think we’ve reached the place where we should be / in terms of equality

[S7] I kind of feel the same way / because / I mean / if you look at TV shows and stuff / you only see / you see like only a couple / black / not just like black women but just like women in general / like / that’s in / um / power / and / it’s like / I feel like men still have like / sometimes / it’s / it’s like an unspoken / like / I don’t know / idea / or something that’s within them / and they feel like you’re inferior to women / who are / not even inferior but like intimidated by women / who / make more money or do bigger things than they do / so / how / what can we do to change it? / I’m not a big change person yet / so / come back to me on that one

[S5] Um / I guess / yea / I think it does exist a little bit but I think it sometimes can exist for guys also / like / just to bring up / like the nanny thing / like / guys / no one wants a guy / a male / as their child’s nanny / really / so / I mean / I don’t find too many stories or here find myself really affected by it that much cause you still see women in high position jobs / like / I know a lot of people around me / the women have better jobs than their husbands / and / then like on TV / there are / you’ll see different things / like / the show Desperate Housewives / Do you guys watch it?

[Laughter]

[S8] No

[S7] I used to

[S5] Well / they have like / it’s just / they have / I think it’s / I think women are in the work fields a lot / because / like / um / one of the women is / was like this high / she was high in the / business world / whatever / but then she stopped to become / a / housewife / so it was kind of her choice / so / I think that that’s nice that women are able to now / be able to choose between the two

[S7] Uh-huh

[S6] Yea / I think when it does exist it has more to do with the mentality / and an attitude / that you / like you said / that’s kind of left over / from an older period / um / like / human society has been structured on / like / a paternalistic kind of mode / for / practically as long as it’s been around / um / and I think that’s only really started changing to any great extent within the last 100 hundred years / and I think because of that / while we’ve come along way we still have a longer way to go

[S5] Do you mind it? Just being a girl? Like / do you care? You seem like a paternalistic / attitude

[S7] I don’t even know what paternalistic means.

[S6] Like / male oriented

[S7] Oh

[S6] Like in terms of / like / a male hierarchy / almost of things / like the women are the ones who stay home and take care of the kids / whereas the men are the hunter-gatherers / stereotypically

[S7] Yea I have a problem with that / I mean / I just feel like / women should have the same / I mean / in being that men and women are both humans / it’s like / it’s not / I mean / yes there’s like genetically / cause I’m a bio major / so yes / it’s like genetically different like things about how women can’t do as much as men can / but / that shouldn’t be like the basis of everything / cause just like / a lot of things now / women don’t even get a chance / or at least / women didn’t get the chance / and now they’re / more so / so women are kind of creeping up and you have women now that just came out and was like / you know what / I don’t like this / I don’t like that I have to just sit at home / ya know / that’s not / really / like me being a nurse / I just / I mean / wanting to be a nurse / I just really feel like that’s / it’s still / although our like / position / but it gives / so you still have advantages to a doctor / who’s like / who usually might be / you have like a male doctor / like / sometimes you can even tell them what to do / sometimes / so you still / like / I don’t know / the whole male dominant thing / but / it’s changing / a lot / you can actually see it changing a lot though

[S8] I think a lot of the change really has to do with their like / all the / all of like the technology increases / and all of that / because now that / we’re in this period / like this day and age / right now we have all these other options out here / like / there’s jobs with computers / um / and everything like that / and / really / you can’t specify a gender to that / I mean / if you look at like history and all of that / you see / ok / like / I don’t know / like hunting and gathering / that kind of stuff / all the physical labor / it’s mostly associated with the males / but / there’s really nothing you can argue about when it comes to like business or any of / like anything / like anything in the business industry / or / any of that stuff / so / like it really

[S5] Yea / all capable of the same thing

[S8] Yea / so it’s really hard to / like / have any justification for discriminating when it comes to that

[S6] Yea / I think that change to a post-industrial economy has had a lot to do that with that / cause / since the economy is more service oriented now / those are jobs that don’t have as many stereotypes associated with them / and like you were talking about / even today to a certain extent people still associate / the / job of a nurse with a female and associate the job of a doctor with a male / even though that isn’t necessarily true / when you actually look at the numbers 

[S5] Would you ever want to be a stay-at-home mom?

[S7] I don’t really like / honestly / um / I love kids / love them to death [inaudible] / but when they’re at that stage when they’re / like / 3 to like 12 / and they just can’t stop talking / and / I cannot stand that stage at all

[Laughter]

[S7] So / I want kids to be born and then become adults

[S6] That’s a long stage / til they’re 12

[S7] I know / they just keep talking 

[S8] Yea / plus / nowadays with like

[S5] I thought u were gonna say 3 to 18

[Laughter]

[S8] Well that works actually too / because nowadays with like prices of like college and all of that

[S7] Yea

[S8] You can’t really have one person making the money and then paying for the children to go to a good school or whatever / I mean

[S5] It’s hard

[S8] Yea / practically impossible / that’s like half of like / it’s probably / like / our tuition for a year is like / someone’s annual income

[S7] A small car

[S8] Yea

[Laughter]

[S8] I wouldn’t even say a small car 

[Laughter]

[S5] That’s a pretty decent size

[Laughter]

[S6] Yea / that’s like a Mercedes

[Laughter]

[S5] So / what was the original question?

[S8] Gender discrimination

[S5] In the workplace?

[S8] Yea

[S5] I don’t / I haven’t really heard / any / stories about gender discrimination in the workplace / like firsthand / I haven’t seen it really / I don’t / I don’t hear about it that much

[S7] You really kind of hear it on TV

[S5] Yea / I think that’s the only

[S7] It’s like nothing something you really hear / like / in / like / I mean / I feel like / it’s like / once again / like an unspoken thing / like / you know 

[S8] Yea 

[S7] In like computer science / you see like / 2 females and the rest are all males

[S8] [Laughter] Pretty much

[S7] It’s like male dominating subjects / surprisingly now / in my class / as / um / a bio major / it’s / um / usually like all men do this / like / bio is a science / but now it’s like a / it’s like / now the class is like 3 males and the rest is all females / so / it’s like changing / gradually though

[S8] Yea / it’s

[S7] It’s cause of our generation

[S8] Yea / it’s definitely becoming more of a choice nowadays / but / I mean / you still have these like / unspoken kind of taboos / like / taboo practices that still take place in the workplace / like / you still see / these / um / I don’t know / like / I don’t want to / get too political / but / like far right wing conservative people / like / who are / all stuck up / on like / traditions / where / the male is kind of the dominant role / like / just choosing to pay different 

[S5] Yea / I would / yea / I was gonna say I would kind of agree with that / to maybe / the gender discrimination is more / not really as much a discrimination but sometimes women not reaching for those jobs because they feel like they’re not supposed to be / because of their / like / what / what is expected of them / like / just / um / actually someone was just / um / a person I work with was mentioning the other day / they had like a meeting about how / a lot of the higher / like the presidents of the things here or like the / whatever the higher people / are / all males / and like / the women in our school / even though there are more of us / will go for the vice president or the secretary or the treasurer / and / they were saying that they think it has to do with a lot of the population here / like just for example being Italian almost / ya know / like the Italian where the is that dominant guy and the woman / the woman / I don’t want to sound bad / [Laughter] / but / like / the woman will take the / below them / just as something

[S6] That’s true even in like / Fortune 500 companies / if you look at the CEOs of all the Fortune 500 companies they’re still by and large predominantly male positions / and / I mean / I think part of that is leftover because / I mean / it’s a lot of white guys who have those jobs if we’re going to be perfectly honest / and I think a lot of those are holdovers from a previous generation / I think that’ll change gradually

[S7] Yea

[S6] But you do still see it there

[S7] I feel like if we came back to this in like probably a good 10 years

[S5] It would be different

[S7] Yea / I don’t even feel like

[S8] A lot different

[S7] It would be like a discussion to talk about it / we’d be like / yea / that was back in like the 50s / this is now / that’s not how this / ya know

[Laughter]

[S7] I mean / there’s still / I feel like if you really look at it’s like a big like 180 / it’s like / back in the 1950s there was like a good 100% stay-at-home moms / and then now / it’s like / a good

[S5] Stay-at-home dads

[S7] Yea

[S5] You hear about a lot of stay-at-home dads

[S7] Yea / you do / there’s a lot of stay-at-home dads now / and / I feel like if you have more of that gender discrimination of / ok / you have the men working and then the women not really working / it’s / that creates a lot of problems in the home especially when it comes to education / and / like / seeing / well / the husband’s like / well / I make the money so therefore I can do whatever I want with it / that creates like a lot of different problems and stuff

[S8] Yea / back to what you were saying about / um / how it’s also because like some women won’t pursue that 

[S5] Uh-huh

[S8] Like you were giving / um / that they’ll go for like vice-president and stuff like that / I think also part of that might be caused because like / it’s / in a way it’s discouraged / not like / through school or anything like that but just / like / by being presented with all these images / of / the male in that role / like / both genders get that kind of idea that like / oh / it’s discouraged that women should try to pursue this / and therefore it becomes like a mindset where / they choose not to / because they don’t feel like it’s in their league or anything like that

[S5] Yea / I can definitely see that. Has there ever been / a women / um / to run for President besides now Hilary Clinton thinking about it?

[S6] Um / I think that Dole ran in the last election

[S7] Yea

[S5] Dole?

[S6] But she didn’t get the Republican nomination / and / um / I forget what her name is / but somebody ran as a candidate for Vice President on one of the major tickets / in the early 90s, late 80s I would say

[S5] In the early 90s?

[S7] And now we have a / what’s it called? Speaker of the house or house representative or something 

[S6] Yea / Nancy Pelosi 

[S7] Yea / oh / man I was excited about that 

[S6] Yea / she’s

[S7] And a Democrat / Wooh

[S6] I was excited about having a women in that job / but / I don’t really like Nancy Pelosi

[S5] When did that happen?

[S6] Uh / like a month ago

[S7] Yea

[S5] Oh / so it’s / she’s

[S6] Within the last election the Democrats got the majority in the house

[S5] Is that why they applauded her / I remember watching the State of 

[S6] Uh-huh / she’s the first woman to hold that job

[S5] Oh

[S7] And the Democrats just have the / have the majority for the past 12 years

[S5] So it’s already changing.

[S7] Yes / it’s so beautiful / I’m so excited

[S6] Harvard / I think Harvard just nominated their first female president / too / of the college

[S5] Of the college?

[S7] Do big things

[S5] Yea

[S5] Is there a second part to the question or was it just that one?

[Yea / do you want to talk about / um / do you think that / um / men are ever discriminated against? In the workplace or otherwise if you can think of anything.]

[S5] Well / I think sometimes the men / men can be discriminated against in the workplace / like you said with / um / um / that you want to be a nurse / like in the nursing / like / it just looks sometimes funny when you see a male as a nurse / it’s like / oh / ok

[S6] I’ve only met like two in my entire life

[S5] Uh-huh

[S6] And come from a family of / like / nurses

[S5] I guess that would be / yea / a discrimination

[S8] Yea / it’s not really a spoken discrimination though / but / it is discrimination / I mean / like you / you see like a male nurse / and you just kind of laugh to yourself / I mean / like / meet the parents

[S5] Ben Stiller [Laughter]

[S8] He was a male nurse and everyone just kind of laughed at him

[S5] Uh-huh

[S8] And that’s / really true / I mean / like / someone says they’re a male nurse you’re gonna / even if you don’t think about it too hard you’re still gonna giggle a little bit in your mind / I mean / if you don’t like say anything to them / but / you’re gonna think that’s kind of weird

[S5] I’m sure there’s probably some very feminist women too / who / would / be / but discriminate against guys just because

[S8] Oh / yea 

[S5] They think all women are / or have been dealing with it / so / but I think that’s kind of unfair

[S8] Yea / I think that’s / I don’t know / the way that feminism had evolved I think / as where first it was more fighting for the rights of women now it’s just become we hate men

[S5] Yea / it’s like fighting against them

[S8] It’s like / instead of working together / it’s more of fighting against / and / it’s kind of just / it’s only furthering the discrimination / it’s not really helping anything because then you have the guys who want to retaliate to that / and
[S6] I think it depends on what portion / what type of feminism you’re talking about though

[S8] Yea

[S6] Cause there definitely is that militant branch of it / but they’re also like a lot of feminist literary critics and art historians these days who are doing like revisionist histories of things / which are kind of useful cause they’re looking back / at like early art works / early pieces of literature and pointing out ways in which / they / there’s this embedded mind / paternalistic mindset / like / like we mentioned earlier / and I think that’s a useful function / that’s not necessarily the same thing as just carping / I mean 

[S8] Yea / exactly that too / um / because / like / when you have these like more militant like / branches of feminism / it / like / I don’t know / like / you / there’s some people who see that as / oh / that’s what all feminism stands for / so / therefore they’ll see like / the / that women trying to advance themselves is a bad thing / like / these guys / like / in the higher powers / they’ll see these militant feminists / and 

[S5] Uh-huh

[S8] They’ll just assume that / all women are trying to do this and takeover / so / they’re gonna become more / kind of / I don’t know / discriminatory / and try to / keep it the way it is / rather than allow too much change

[S6] Rush Limbaugh’s Femi-Nazis

[S8] Oh yea

[S7] What does Femi-Nazi mean?

[S6] We// Rush Limbaugh the political commentator who I hate with a vengeance

[Laughter]

[S6] Um / he coined the term Femi-Nazi for extreme feminists / that he doesn’t like

[Laughter]

[S6] Yea

[S7] Is that like the connotation he’s put with like women / and like / if a women tries to proceed like a man’s job she seems like a butch / and then / ya know / they’re kinda looked on like really intimidating / and / if a women tries / a guy tries to proceed like a women’s job or what’s characterized as a women’s job / then they’re like / well / ya know / why’s he / he’s a little feminine there / why you trying stuff like that

[Laughter]

[S7] And / it’s sad because it’s not giving people any freedom of like choice / at all / it’s like / ya know / they / actually / well people have the freedom of choice / but then they’re like / well / ya know / they’re gonna get looked down upon by even family / cause / ya know / as much as some like families say / ya know / go out and do what you want / if you do what you want and it’s not exactly what they wanted / they’ll look at you like / ya know / whichever way / if you’re a butch or if you’re a little bit like girly or something like that 

[S8] Yea / I think it’s now becoming / like it’s now becoming an issue if you’re like butch or if you’re gay and all of that / if you just try to pursue something that you want to do / even if it’s / I don’t know / it normally appeals to the opposite gender 

[S5] I don’t know if there’s anything else to say

[S7] Yea

[So what do you think about that? About not being able to maybe / just choose what you want to do without having a stigma attached to it? Like an occupation]

[S5] Well / I kind of think / almost / but / it’s what you said / because of our gender we’re more inclined to do things / is that how you ended it / or

[S8] Yea

[S5] I kind of / I guess would agree with that / because / I don’t think that there’s many women that would want to / work in construction

[S7] Yea

[S5] And / I don’t think there’s many men that would choose to / um 

[S8] Nanny [Laughter]

[S5] Yea / be a nanny / trying to think / I was gonna say hairstylist or something but then / I had / there’s so many [Laughter] it’s / so I think / but back in / back then would there be as many men hairstylists? No / right? So everything’s kind of starting / were there / or

[S7] There weren’t a lot / it’s like / everything’s kind of like 

[S5] Mixing now

[S7] Yea / it’s like / you still have some of those like extreme jobs where not a lot of people have / ya know / not a lot of men and not a lot of women / but / it’s like / gradually everything is kind of starting to go over now and starting to change a little bit

[S5] Uh-huh

[S7] Um

[S5] Silence / Gender discrimination / this is probably hard cause / we’re not really like in the work / place [Laughter]

[S6] Yea

[S8] Yea / it makes it harder / but I mean / you can make observations

[Well / it doesn’t have to be in the workplace. Can you think of any other examples?]

[S8] Hmm

[S5] In school

[S6] I don’t know / I think it’s interesting how a lot of the major around here / tend to be male or female dominated / and / I don’t know / depending on what they are

[S5] Yes / they are

[S6] Like / I’m the / last time / I’m an Art History minor / and / last time I checked / all the Art History majors were females and I’m the only Art History minor

[S5] That’s like psychology / I’m doing a lot of psychology class

[S6] And Speech Path too

[S5] Uh-huh / and I think that there’s maybe 4 or 5 guys in my class

[S6] Uh-huh

[S5] What are you?

[S7] I’m a bio major.

[S5] Bio? Are you evenly split? Or

[S7] Not actually / cause right now we’re just kind of taking / like / we’re not taking like the upper level biologys yet / we’re just kind of taking like the lower ones where everybody if they want to be a bio-psych they don’t really have take as much / um / of the upper level things / but / now surprisingly / I know in chemistry and I know in organic chemistry / surprisingly you see a lot of females now / I’m not in it / but like / I’ve heard from experiences / like / there’s just not a lot of / um / males are in that / and it’s really surprising / well all the / cause / I think like all the / um / all the teachers / all the professors are / all / um / males / and a lot of

[S5] In the bio department?

[S7] In bio and even in / well / not even bio so much but chem / chemistry / it’s not really / I don’t even think there’s any chemistry / female chemistry professors

[S6] I mean / I guess you could expect it to some extent cause there is a higher percentage of females on campus in the student body / but / like / when virtually all of the majors in one particular discipline are female / you know / that’s a big difference

[S5] But then like / in my Spanish / I know that / but with my Spanish class / like / just a regular class that everyone has to take there’s more guys

[S6] Uh-huh

[S5] In that class

[S6] That’s cause guys wait longer to take classes like that

[S8] I think when it comes to something like language it’s more of a split decision / where as it comes to like 

[S5] Uh-huh

[S8] Something like / that you’re gonna major in / that you’re gonna do for the rest of your life / you see those / you definitely see those differences like / as a computer science major / like / I think there’s / I think there’s only one other female computer science major / and / I mean 

[S5] Are you a computer science major?

[S8] Yea 

[S5] I didn’t know that

[S8] We have a very small like group / but / like / just the fact that there’s only like one girl out of like everybody / I think there’s / there’s at least / 8 or 9 guys in there / and / it’s just

[S7] I know the one girl you’re talking about / [inaudible]

[S8] Yea / there’s just that ratio there / if you look at that and compare it to other majors / it’s / really a good amount / like nine to one / is / still / big gap

[S5] Yea / that is a big gap

[S8] I don’t even think that the discrimination / um / in / school / and stuff / is restricted to the / just classes / I think it also has to do with like the social scene / and all of that / like / the way you act, the way you dress or whatever / is typically associated with like / your gender / like guys are supposed to act a certain way / girls are supposed to act this way / and / I don’t know 

[What do you think about that, guys?]

[S5] Give me an example

[S8] I don’t know / like

[S5] Just because I’m a girl I’m supposed to act?

[S8] Like / I don’t know / like on this campus / I really / I guess it depends on what school you go to

[S5] I’m scared [Laughter]

[S8] On this campus in particular / like / girls are supposed to dress all nice / I mean 

[S5] Wear a north face, Uggs

[Laughter]

[S8] Exactly / yea

[S5] Pop the collar

[S6] Big sunglasses

[S8] And guys are supposed to wear like the polo shirts / um

[S5] I hate the polo shirts

[S8] Pop the collar maybe

[S5] Their own Uggs / I didn’t know there were guys Uggs until I came to this campus

[Laughter]

[S6] Guys were supposed to wear Timerlands for a while / I don’t know what happened to that

[S7] This campus got Hilly / and Timerlands are heavy [Laughter] / but / as you can see / I am far from / um / I mean / Uggs and all that other type of stuff / but / I feel like that’s / that’s like / and during the summer / well / I don’t know / I’m not really / like / a dress up person / especially during the winter time / but / I think 

[S5] I’m lazy during winter

[S7] Yea / but during the summertime / or even during the spring / I feel like / it’s gonna be like / a complete / like / real fashion show on this campus / like everyone’s gonna be really dressed up / and like / ya know / really trying to put on like their best outfit to come to class with / which I don’t understand too much / but

[Laughter]

[S5] So if you see any / if you see me in Springville / on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays I work / so I do dress nicer / on those days / unlike on Tuesdays and Thursdays / that’s why I kind of feel like / cause I’ll sit there / and like / laugh about with some of my friends / like / oh yea / people really get like decked out / but then / sometimes / on like those days when I work I have to / dress nicer / so I kind of feel like / [Laughter] / I just put my head down walking across the bridge / um / yea / but I guess / I would agree that there is a gender discrimination / as to / what / is expected / of / males and females at this school / like you said

[S8] Yea / I even think / I even think the actions / like / of the people / like / I don’t know / one thing that I want to bring up is / ok / the drinking scene / like / the guys / they’re supposed to be able to pound like 12 beers and be like / oh / I just have a little buzz / and then the girls take like 2 shots / and they’re like falling over / like / I just feel like that’s an image / that like / many people have

[S5] That’s a good example

[Laughter]

[S5] That is a good example because that’s exactly how / I feel like / it’s always portrayed

[S7] Yes

[S5] Even if people are pretending [Laughter]

[S6] I can’t pound back 12 beers

[Laughter]

[S6] I don’t weigh that much

[S5] But in reality / I think that can sometimes be opposite / well / not opposite / but like / I see some guys who / are sloppy messes and they haven’t even drank anything / and then some girls who are sloppy messes after taking 2 shots for some reason

[S8] [Laughter] Yea

[S5] But then / there’s also girls who can / out drink

[S7] [Inaudible]
[S8] Yea / again / I don’t / probably / I don’t know

[S5] Um / trying to think of other ways of gender discrimination / what about in / um / expectations for like / making the move on a date / I always / think / oh / it’s supposed to be the guy definitely / like it’s a guys job

[S8] Yea / I think there’s a lot of pressure when it comes to that / especially for the guys / because / that kind of thought is / definitely out there / like / oh / it’s the guys move / the guy’s supposed to be the one who does that / not the girl / but / I don’t know / I think there’s certain things that each like character is supposed to do towards that

[S5] Uh-huh

[S8] Like / the girl’s supposed to act a certain way / and the guy’s supposed to pick up on that and kind of make the first move

[S7] I don’t even think it’s like / not even with dating / but it’s like / even just like trying to / like / trying to get a girl when you’re out at the mall / or / if you’re just out in public / then / it’s like / it’s always expected of the guy / to kind of come up to the girl / and be like / hey, how are you doing? Kinda / ya know / just 

[S8] Yea

[S7] And then / but / it’s like / also like opposite / like / if a girl tries to do it then the guy’s like / what the heck are you doing? Ya know [Laughter]

[S5] There’s so many unspoken rules

[Laughter]

[S7] Yea / there are / but / I just / I don’t / I feel like that’s / like a lot / like why / cause a lot of guys are really upset / like / you know I can never get a girl and then they get all mad at it / and I’m like / if you / made it seem like it was ok for girls to actually come up to you / not make it seem like if / you know / like / we’re all butch and we’re not objects trying to come up and talk to you / then it might be a little bit different 

[S8] While we’re talking about that / like / just the whole like / dating thing / if you / when most people think about a girl who’s dated a lot of guys / they kind of say / oh / she’s a whore / but / if a guy has dated a lot of girls / they’re like / oh / he’s a pimp / he gets all the ladies / he’s cool / like

[S5] He’s applauded

[S8] Yea / it’s kind of applauded as opposed to looked down upon / and / yea

[S5] I don’t like that

[S7] Yea

[S5] I don’t like that at all

[S7] I think that’s kind of changing

[S6] It’s a double standard

[S7] Yea / it’s / I mean 

[S8] Yea / that’s definitely slowly changing

[S7] Yea / it is / because / I mean / now / it / it depends though because if you’re like / with a group of girls or whatever and you know those girls and they know that you go out on a lot of dates / it like / you can go out on a lot of dates / and / hold yourself really well at all times

[S8] Uh-huh

[S7] And you just / like to be / you’re kinda like a date person / you always want to go out / always meet new people / but / it’s also about how you hold yourself / and / usually / the stereotype that’s associated with girls that go out all the time / are / the girls that kind of go out and give it up at the same time / and / like / ya know

[S5] Yea / I would agree / cause / like / sometimes / um / I hate to say it / like / when you see a person that does go out all the time and you see / like / pictures of them all dressed up / getting sloppy and everything / automatically what comes to mind / oh / she’s probably / like / just sleeping around and everything / and then / if like you get to know that person and you find out that they’re not / I / I’ve like / in situations I’ve actually like done this / like seen this and thought this / and then when I get to know the person and you find out that they’re totally not / so I think that’s another kind of like / it’s supposed to go hand and hand but it really doesn’t

[S7] Yea

[You guys have any other thoughts?]

[S8] No

[Ok. End of discussion}
