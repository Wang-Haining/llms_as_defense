GENDER DISCRIMINATION
[Do you feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the present day United States, and if so what can we do to change this?]
[S11] Oh my.
[I want one of you guys to start.]
[S12] Well /I /I would say that it is /um /I mean just /uh /yes
[Laughter]
[S9] Well, talking from personal experience /um /my Dad’s an engineer and you know when I was growing up he always used to joke around /you know don’t be an engineer /there’s like no women in the field and stuff like that, and it’s /it’s you know really true when I do talk to him /there’s never any women in like high level positions in the engineering field /and I think there’s still a lot of fields like that where women aren’t /um /equally represented as men are given /uh /positions that are as good
[S11] Well, there’s the opposite too.
[S9] Hmm?
[S11] There’s the opposite too /teaching
[S9] Well, yeah, which are dominated by women and then you know /you look at our government and what’s the first time in U.S. history that there’s a female speaker of the house and only the second female secretary of state /I mean it’s been such a /there’s such a lasting tradition of gender discrimination, I think /I think it’s kinda like what we were talking about last time /there’s just a lot of [inaudible] of racism and things like that /it’s really /um /if it ever is completely possible to do /um /it’s gonna take a lot longer to eradicate from society
[S11] Is there really a difference between gender discrimination and racism though? It’s just a different kind of racism.
[S9] Yeah, that’s why /that’s like I said /it’s the same thing
[S11] Yeah, that’s like /so like 
[S10] You also have like a shorter history /the United States being relatively young in the grand scheme of things /suffrage in France [inaudible] /whatever in Europe /whatever /didn’t
[S11] Well, my grandmother /women didn’t work in Germany until about 40 years ago
[S10] True, and that’s another [inaudible] /so I guess we’re more progressive in the grand scheme of things than most countries, but since I’m like /I think it’s pretty obvious there’s just certain fields and professions where it’s dominated by one or the other /I mean for Loyola /Loyola’s a female dominated school
[S11] Seventy, thirty /baby
[S10] Ya know /and I mean
[S12] I thought it was sixty, forty
[S11] It’s seventy, thirty now
[S10] Either way
[S9] Well that’s another thing I /hate /it was last year /I was reading an article in Newsweek about education, and about how it seems to be like a pendulum swing in the other direction in elementary education, whereas it used to be that the teachers always focused on the boys because you know the boys had to go to the schools and things like that /and /and how now it seems like the education is much more focused on girls because there are /and you know there have been studies and stuff /you know, boys and girls learn differently /and that it’s /and then it seems like teachers are more catering to girls and like the boys were being left behind and they kind of become like the goof balls of the class and /and [inaudible]
[S11] Well, I was just thinking that, if I have to think about my classes /8 a.m. class there’s three guys /my 3 o’clock class, there’s two guys /it’s just there’s /there’s so many more women on this campus
[S10] Oh, I mean I /I 
[S11] And in college in general /I went to visit friends and it’s the same
[S10] I’m in a class right now where it’s 32 people and I’m one of four guys, and I’m almost positive I’m being discriminated against in my grades cause I’m a guy
[S11] What class is it?
[S10] Child welfare
[S11] Oh my, yes
[S10] And my like /for example the last thing we had was this like project on a child welfare agency, so I did Outward Bound /um my girlfriend’s mom runs it in Philadelphia /and um I got 140 out of 200 on it, and it was exactly what she asked for, but she didn’t consider it a worthy enough child welfare organization even though it only deals with children /people in my class /girls were making up camps they worked at /you know /and talking about how they’ve worked with people and getting an average of 186 /was the average grade on the thing /and like I just think she respects the opinion /and I know /I mean the professor’s a little a bit out there too /I mean she’s kind of a feminist type
[S11] I think it goes both ways /it’s not only women that get discriminated against /absolutely /the situation just drives me crazy /I mean look at /look at /uh /suits between parents /who does the child always go with? /the mother whether /even thought a lot of times the father would be better off /it’s because a child should be with their mother /I don’t think /that’s a load of crap 
[S10] No, I agree.
[S11] It’s a load of crap /it should go to the parent who can best provide for the child /take care of the child /and give a loving environment to the child /it’s /it’s a different thing between work and /and family situations, but either way /the discrimination is ridiculous
[S10] You also /I mean to our country’s credit you have /um /the evolution now of the stay at home father /which is /which is
[S11] Great
[S10] Much more prevalent /yeah absolutely /that’s my family /my Mom brings home almost
[S11] The bacon
[S10] She’s a veterinarian, which is another /until /when she was in /in med school /in vet school /it was Pennsylvania /it was one of the three women to graduate in her entire class /you know /now it’s a female dominated profession /you know /it’s interesting /it’s the evolution of 
[S9] Yeah, I mean my Mom /uh / she and my Dad are the same age and so that means they got married in like the early 20’s /and you know they both graduated from college and then they didn’t have enough money for both of them to go to graduate school /so who goes to graduate school? /my Dad /so now she’s /now she’s a teacher 
[S11] Let’s just think about this /we always hear about you know the glass ceiling /does anyone ever talk about the glass elevator /I mean in female /in feminine dominated fields a lot of times men will get promotions a lot sooner /I mean nursing is supposed to have in particular /my friend’s going through nursing /she’s a nurse and I mean /all the time /there /she’s been working for about five years /there will be men /male nurses that have worked at the same place /do the same exact job as her /she does more work, and they get promoted over her just because it’s a male /it’s a female-dominated field and they need to put more men out there /and I mean I think the same thing happens sometimes in male-dominated fields with females /not often, but it does happen /and discrimination hurts everybody, so
[S12] I don’t know. Have you guys ever heard of like /I don’t know if it’s true or not, but someone once told me when they were revising the SAT like in our junior year /um /that
[S9] Hate them for that by the way.
[S11] Yeah, it sucks.
[S12] Um /that /I was told that /um /the essay section /um /and the revisions made to the math section /or some /like and the elimination of the analogies and what not /all that stuff /that that was done so that the test would be more fair to female students
[S11] It /that’s what they /that’s what they /that’s what it was done for /because the male brain processes certain things better than the female brain and there’s different parts of the brain that are used /um / I remember reading this whole article on it for my psych class /for my A.P. psych class
[S10] I thought that it was culturally unfair.
[S11] It’s both /it’s bother because /um 
[S9] It’s /well the whole SAT is socioeconomically unfair /I mean
[S11] That’s the /it shouldn’t /I mean standardized testing in general /not everyone learns the same way /I mean I suck at multiple choice /I’m great at essays, but I have friends who are awesome at multiple choice and suck at essays/like I don’t so well in my psych classes because most of them are multiple choice based classes
[S10] Yeah, I found that out too.
[S11] It sucked.
[S10] And I hated psychology here because /and I thought it’d be interesting, but I ended up hating it because you have like seven tests and they’re all multiple choice questions, and /it’s impossible to learn
[S11] I’m a psych major right now.
[S10] Are you?
[S11] I’m a /I have a C in my psych personality class because it is all multiple choice.
[S10] I mean I’m a history major, so I didn’t take a multiple choice test until I got to that class.
[S11] I /um /actually our first test was majority multiple choice and essay /75% multiple choice and essay /I did not get a point off on my essays, but I got the majority of the multiple choice wrong /people test different ways, so standardized testing is unfair to everybody because nobody’s gonna get it all
[S10] Hmm
[S11] And I mean it comes back to the /there’s differences /there are differences between the genders, but there’s no reason to discriminate one reason or the other
[S10] There /um /there may be a professional course now that is a precedent set by /uh /Wimbledon this year is gonna give equal prize money to /this is the first time for any sport 
[S11] I remember hearing about this.
[S10] Right, Wimbledon’s gonna pay the male champion and the female champion equal.
[S12] They didn’t do that before?
[S11] No
[S10] Nope, nothing /no other sport
[S11] Nobody does that /no one does that /women soccer players get paid less than male 
[S10] Yeah, it’s the first sport 
[S11] Ever /except for archery /archery is the only co-ed sport in the Olympics or anywhere
[S10] Alright /[laughter]
[S11] There’s no difference between the sexes, but 
[S9] You know I remember /I think it was /I don’t know a year or two ago /I was reading an article where they were talking about Venus Williams, and they were talking about the disparity in um /uh /prize money for male and female tennis players /and you know /they were asking what she thinks about a solution /you know because people were talking about how maybe it’s not fair because you know men play the five sets and women only play three sets
[S10] Which, is true, they do play more sets.
[S9] And, I thought it was interesting /Venus said that well, why not just have them men play three sets 
[S11] Or the women play five sets /but I think there are things that men do better than women and women do better than men /I mean personally /I was actually have this discussion with my /my /my boss last week /firefighters /they have a different test for women and for men /it should be the same test as men have to be because frankly if /I’m a big girl /I’m six feet tall and 200 pounds /someone who’s /no offense /like a woman who’s taller and slighter /I’m sorry you’re smaller than /I’m sorry
[S12] [Laughter]
[S11] Um /but if a woman is her size and she passes the female test, but didn’t pass the male test /I’m not gonna be comfortable being saved from a burning building by someone who’s 5’4’’ and 150 pounds because frankly she’s not gonna be able to pick me up and throw me over her shoulder, and I think that having /there should be the same test /I think the women should be made to hit the same /there’s a reason those standards are there and everybody should have to hit them /not just men /so I think that’s not really discrimination so much as necessary, but I know a lot of people see /oh, that’s discrimination /they’re not firemen anymore, they’re firefighter, and blah, blah, blah, blah /when it comes to stuff like that /it’s not so much discrimination, and I think a lot of times America’s way too P.C. or maybe the world’s way too P.C. when it comes to those because sorry political correctness isn’t always the most important thing
[S10] Yeah 
[S11] I mean would you feel comfortable having /you know having a 5’8’’ woman who
[S10] No, I completely agree with you.
[S11] You know /saving you? /from a burning building? /or you know, tackling down the /the /the guy who’s trying to kill you /[laughter]
[S10] No, I know what you mean. I think /um /for like individual /um /I don’t know /I hate to point to sports, but it’s kind of like an interesting way to look at the entire situation /um /for like individual sports or like an individual practice per say for like a veterinarian or an M.D. /whatever /like everything should be equivalent /or based upon how well they’re doing /how much work they’re doing /or you know /your clients they have yada, yada /for team type things whereas you might have like /um /per say like you know a company /or a big business where you have like the different levels or whatever /um /uh /you should /you know that should all be the same way according to 
[S11] How well the team is doing as a whole
[S10] Right, the team as a whole /exactly /um and then it doesn’t /you know whoever is the leader /it’s a shame because you still have a generation of older, white males that run all the corporations for the most part /but that’s something that’s gonna be in the next ten to fifteen years /twenty years /changing just as speaker of the house, just like
[S11] I don’t know if it’s gonna change as soon as you think /as soon as people think
[S10] But, as soon as these people start to retire /you might start to see it
[S11] No offense, but I think still men get that /they get that push /they get that /you know /women are still expected to stay home with kids /I could never imagine myself staying home with kids /never /never in a million years
[S9] I mean what did /what did /what was it /the president of Harvard /was it last year? /who /who you know in a public speech or something /put down women and said they can’t /uh /uh /achieve /uh /or they can’t really learn or understand math or science as well as men /or that guys
[S11] Yeah I remember this.
[S9] You remember this?
[S11] It drove me crazy when I heard it.
[S9] Yeah /like I don’t remember exactly what he said, but it was something to that effect.
[S11] He said that women /women shouldn’t be in the math and science fields because they can’t understand it /they can’t process it and they never will
[S9] Yeah
[S12] Are you serious?
[S11] Yes /and 
[S9] I mean the president of Harvard 
[S11] But, I mean what’s the main goal when you grow up as a guy /when you know /you’re expected to have a job and you know bring home the money and have a family /we’re expected to stay home with the kids and raise them 
[S10] I mean my family always preached more just like you grow up to be happy /you know?
[S11] Right, I’m not saying every family, but the majority of society /I mean I still have people saying /cause I /I have like a ten year plan for my life, and people are like well aren’t you gonna get married? /aren’t you gonna have kids?
[S9] Mmhmm.
[S11] I’m like yeah, but I’m not staying /I have a plan /like that doesn’t /like I /I deserve just as much right as anybody else
[S9] But then again, I also think that present is /there’s also a stereotype against women settling down and just having kids /just wanting to be a wife and mother from certain areas /I mean my high 
[S11] That’s /oh I’m sorry
[S9] I mean my high school /you know /God forbid you would ever say anything like that /that you just want to have a family and be a mother you know and if /it’s so /I went to an all-girls, private, high school
[S11] So did I, we have the same thing
[S9] So you know, it’s gotta be /you know /a hundred percent graduation rate and going to college /you know?
[S11] Yeah
[S9] It, it can’t be anything else
[S11] You know what /if you want to stay home and take care of the kids, that’s what you want to do /I am still expected to stay home /my family is very traditional /you know my /my Mom didn’t /neither of my parents went to college, but my Mom stayed home and took care of the kids and my Dad worked /my Mom had a job in /and my Dad ended up asking her to quit /stay home with us, even though you know I was nine /could take care of my little brother /whatever /sore spot, but I’m still expected to get married, and settled down and have children /and you know stay home /and once they’ve gone to college and graduated, I can pick up my life again /and that’s ridiculous /I think socially that’s the main /that’s still what’s seen as socially acceptable /for a woman to be
[S10] It’s also like what a large portion /the middle /wants
[S11] Oh, absolutely /that’s fine, but I don’t think that should be the only norm that there is, and right now that is still the socially acceptable norm /that’s the only one
[S9] And, and, and what I’m saying too I think is /I guess just in the realm of education /there’s kind of like a pendulum swing in the other direction trying to make up for that norm that has been in place for so long /you know in terms of elementary education and
[S11] But I also think that if /people think that if you don’t get married and have children /you don’t have a full life, and if you are a women who’s older and have success, but you’re a spinster because you don’t have a family
[S10] Yeah /I mean 
[S11] Just in general /I’m not saying everybody thinks that way
[S10] But, also there’s like the east coast and the west coast mentality.
[S11] I’ve never been to the west coast, so I can’t really
[S10] I think it’s similar to the east coast in terms of like /um /equality and progression /right /and then there’s like 
[S11] Indiana
[S10] Right, and I’ll use a specific example of a person I know from [inaudible] Indiana, which is northern Indiana /um /where this girl who was /she was valedictorian of her high school for a thirty eight hundred kid high school /Ok? /she’s like a scratch couple under golfer with offers now to like multiple schools /big time /like Stanford for one /Ok? /she’s not gonna go /she’s gonna go to taxidermist school as a hobby and be a mom
[S11] Is that what she wants though?
[S10] That’s what she wants.
[S11] That’s fine /absolutely great /she’s doing what she wants
[S10] And she’s /right /and she’s the norm for /like she’s not like a girl /if that same girl went to your high schools she’d go to Yale or Stanford /you know?
[S11] Actually, my high school /the teachers gave that mentality /the girls were like do whatever the hell you want /my valedictorian didn’t go to college
[S12] Really?
[S10] Really?
[S11] She decided /the past two years the valedictorian didn’t go to college /she didn’t want to /she wanted to stay home /she wanted to have a family /one of them is married already
[S10] That’s crazy /that’s also the same /like the same /um /demographic of women that you know are /are um /you know like against abortion /you know what I’m saying, Ok? /like it works
[S11] I’m just not gonna have that discussion right now.
[S10] But, it’s the truth though.
[S11] Oh absolutely
[S10] Tradition, and you know
[S11] Traditional mentality
[S10] Right, and that’s /it’s just not /it’s impossible /it’s really, really hard to break that
[S11] I’m trying to, and you know what /I don’t date /I’ve never dated, and I get in college /people look at me like I’m crazy when I say I don’t date /and I’m like I have more important things to do than /and that’s personally for me, that’s my choice /but, having to explain myself to people for that choice drives me absolutely crazy, and I think that if a guy didn’t date no one would /I know guys that don’t date, I know guys that are very open with the fact that they don’t date, but they don’t get questioned about it /I mean one of my friends is an engineer major /he studies, he doesn’t date /he goes out, he hangs out with us, but he doesn’t date, and he never gets asked a question /but I’m like oh /people have asked me what’s wrong with you /why don’t you date? /like I’ve gotten that question , what’s wrong with you? Don’t you want to have a family? Don’t you want to have kids? /And I’m like 
[S12] The same thing /I’m seen that way with my friends and myself /I don’t date and my friends don’t either, but um /their other like female friends will ask them like /they’re female too /[laughter] /but, um no they do get asked that /like why don’t you do whereas I went to an all-guys private, catholic high school whatever /like it didn’t really matter /like it was fine /there was nothing wrong with it
[S11] Oh, I still got asked in high school all the time why I didn’t date /but I hung out /then I hung out with my guy friends /they don’t date, and nobody says a word /so it’s /it’s just this problem /there’s always problems /there’s always going to be problems
[S9] Yeah
[S11] But, it’s just something that I think more people need to be aware of /people don’t think about it
[S9] Yeah, as long as people are aware of it /because I mean it’s always gonna be there
[S11] Be there
[S9] Just because you have individual people with their own ideas and their own /uh /um biases and thoughts about the way the world should be and things like that /it /as long as people don’t forget about it and continue
[S10] If some guy came along and like swept you off your feet, and you completely /you know /took your mind off of school for the first time in your life /wouldn’t that freak you out and you’d possibly think you’d want to go on a date to see 
[S11] No, I’d run the other way.
[S10] Really?
[S11] I /it’s /people have tried /I’ve run the other way because I’m like I have shit to do that’s more important than frankly /dating in college seems pretty frivolous to me because I don’t think that you’re gonna stay with anybody you meet in college /the majority of people /the majority of people aren’t gonna stay with somebody and it’s kind of 
[S10] Isn’t there like a counter to that statistic /you meet like the person you’re
[S11] That’s /that’s fine /it’s kind of /my feeling is that I haven’t grown up yet /there’s a lot of changing I’m gonna do in my 20’s /there’s no way in hell that I have the time or energy to waste on something that’s not gonna matter
[S10] The experiences that you judge /I’m not judging /that you look upon when you’re in your 20’s and 30’s /and if you’re having your first relationship when you’re 25, 26, 30 years old /you’re very reliable to make a mistake that you possibly could have made when you were 19 and it didn’t matter 
[S11] Listen, I’ve had one relationship.
[S10] So you lied.
[S11] No, I said I don’t date now /as in
[S10] Ok, I got ya
[S11] I never said I haven’t dated.
[S10] Oh no, that’s fine.
[S11] It was an /it was a physically and emotionally abusive relationship /I’ve been through that /it’s never gonna happen again
[S10] Well that’s /I’m sorry
[S11] It’s /just I think that /maybe that’s personally part of why I have such an opinion about it /which is just absolutely possible and probably is, but that’s 
[S10] Well, that’s something else.
[S9] Just look the history of /of this country /the number of women who do wait to get married, or don’t marry at all or get divorced and live on their own /it’s increasing
[S11] It is increasing /it’s still really nominal because even single parents /a lot of times they’re still looking for the man to bring home /it’s still a mentality that’s there /and it always will be there, but I think that people don’t think about it because it makes them uncomfortable, and people don’t think about what makes them uncomfortable /the don’t talk about it /they don’t think about it /they just kind of sweep it under the rug /it’s there but
[S10] Like all the topics we’re talking about.
[S11] Exactly /no /that’s exactly what I’m saying /all these topics are things that generally people don’t talk about /I mean I don’t know I talk about /a lot of this stuff I talk about with my friends, but I think that our situation and our college is /I mean not completely /because when I said something yesterday about the shooting at Virginia Tech /people were like wait, what happened? /and I mean this is at eight o’clock at night
[S10] That’s why I hate /I’m gonna throw this out there /I think that Loyola’s like the least enlightened college campus I’ve ever been to
[S11] I’m gonna agree with you.
[S10] And it destroys me because we have /there is very few like open forums for academic endeavors /like open your eyes
[S9] That’s because all people are concerned with is getting drunk.
[S11] Drinking
[S10] I know, people don’t give a shit.
[S9] That’s, that’s all the conversations
[S11] But, you know what? I’ve been to schools that are worse than this.
[S10] I don’t know. Like I go to the University of Virginia or something
[S11] Go to Ohio State.
[S10] Alright, well /I’m a 
[S11] Go to Ohio State, go to Illinois /go to
[S10] No, I know, I know /I mean like half my school goes to Penn State and like I almost went to Penn State and
[S11] Penn State’s a huge party school.
[S10] Right, but within Penn State you have ten thousand kids that do care and that’s twice as many /three times as many people that go to Loyola that do care /you know what I’m saying?
[S11] Personally, I hang out with people that do care. I’m gonna make my /make my effort to hang out with people that do talk about this /we do talk about this /this is what we talk about /we don’t sit around talk about /oh you know I kicked your ass in Halo last night /once in a while, yeah /because I hang out with guys and they play Halo /that’s what they do, but you know we also /like my friend Jimmy and I had this huge debate about abortion about a week and a half ago, and I mean we had an academic /completely academic debate /and 
[S10] Felt good didn’t it?
[S11] I do it with my friends /I do it all the time /I do it with my parents
[S9] Yeah, I used to do it with my friends over midnight breakfast /like [inaudible]
[S11] You know everyone at that breakfast was sitting around you wasted
[Laughter]
[S11] and you’re having /there are people /you just have to search it out and I think that I’m personally going to try to make an effort to talk about this with people /other than people who are in my group
[S10] I think that’s interesting
[S11] And since I’ve done this /I’ve been doing it more
[S10] No, I mean the thing is I’ll have to call my friends at home /my friends from home that go to um /you know /Lehigh /um /or like um /you know Ithaca /or just different schools /whatever /um Villa Nova and so forth /that um /like that are actually more aware of the [inaudible] /and I think that starts with our Professors here /I’m not gonna lie /I have had now seven or six classes since the shootings began yesterday morning and it hasn’t
[S11] Nobody says anything.
[S10] Nobody talks about it in class, yeah
[S11] Which is ridiculous and I mean
[S10] I know /I think /I mean
[S11] You’d think they’d put something out in the Newshound /although we did get an email from Father [inaudible] /which who reads them?
[S10] Nobody
[S9] Although actually I just went to /I just came from /uh /an event /uh /organized by my Spanish professor /uh /it was called um from Baltimore to Palestine and back /it was a whole presentation on the Palestinian culture and music and art and things like that, and there were two speakers there and both of them talked about the shooting
[S11] How many people were there though?
[S9] Um 
[S11] Or was it extra credit for class?
[S9] It was /um /it /well it counts as a cultural event /like in a lot of classes, people are required to go to /that’s what kills me /no one /you know /people organize these things and no one actually shows up /I mean it counts for me as a cultural event, but I would have gone anyway
[S11] I showed up /when I /I think the week they were doing all the stuff about the gay gene, etcetera, etcetera /I couldn’t go to most of them because I was in class, but the one’s I did go to the small turnout boggled my mind /the same thing with the Holocaust
[S10] Yeah
[S11] Boggled my mind /do people not care? I mean do they not realize that if we forget these things that they’re gonna happen again /like 
[S10] That’s Loyola /like 55% of the kids here are just gonna work for their parents
[S11] Exactly
[S9] Seriously
[S11] It drives /but that’s honestly /that’s almost any college /any private, expensive college
[S10] Oh yeah /oh yeah well that’s any private, expensive college /sure, sure, sure
[S11] Honestly, a lot of the community colleges like if I go home and I go to visit my friends up at New Paul’s /they don’t really care either
[S10] Well yeah they don’t care, but that’s like /that’s different they didn’t have to get good SAT scores and have good GPA’s to go there
[S11] I’m just saying, there should be people /they should care /not that it’s right that they don’t /it boggles my mind
[S10] Yeah, yeah /this might just be a generational thing too though /maybe 
[S11] I think a lot of our generation just doesn’t care.
[S9] Yeah
[S11] A lot of our generation doesn’t give a shit.
[S10] With /whatever /it just sucks
[S11] Maybe it’s just
[S10] I think it could also be my friends here. Idiots.
[Laughter]
[S11] I don’t think so /I think it’s a lot of people though /I think a lot of people want to ignore it
[S9] Yeah, no it is.
[S11] They don’t want to talk about it.
[S10] Plus I’m not in classes with all my friends and you know /they don’t care in my classes either
[S9] I mean
[S11] You bring up /you bring up a subject and like people change the subject like almost automatically
[S12] Because it’s not that relevant.
[S11] It’s taboo to talk about /it doesn’t matter /it doesn’t apply to me
[S9] Not to mention if somebody actually brings up something in class /you know it’s like pulling teeth to try and get people to speak
[S10] To talk right? I’ve never /that’s exactly what I /yeah I know
[S11] Oh Ok /did anybody see anything about a /I organized something for a self-injury awareness day /I did this with Psi Chi 
[S10] Slow down. What?
[S11] Um /self injury awareness day
[S10] Oh, injury awareness day
[S11] It’s not this emo 15 year old blah, blah, blah kid thing /it’s not
[S10] I thought you said self-interest.
[S11] No, self injury /self harm /um it was like pulling teeth in Psi Chi which is a psychology honor’s society to get anyone to do anything
[S10] If they needed the research credit, people would do it.
[S11] Exactly /I mean I /you’re supposed to wear orange /just that’s what it is /we had posters all over campus /I saw four people including myself /four people /guess who those were? Those were my friends /those were my friends who could find orange /one of them wore a shirt made of orange post-its
[Laughter]
[S11] But, that effort needs to be put in by more than four people, and that’s anything /I mean look at how big denim day is on our campus, and that’s just because everybody wears denim everyday
[S10] Yeah, it could be a Thursday.
[S11] Exactly /it’s just gonna be a normal day /I mean it’s gotta be something that’s /that’s set apart
[S10] I know, and to go back to the point /I don’t think that it’s gender specific here /I think as an overall like our campus is just [inaudible]
[S11] Oh, absolutely, but see how these topics all blend together? They all have this underlying thing of /it affects everybody.
[S10] But, I mean it’s /at the same time like /like we don’t go to you know /Harvard or Princeton, and like where there’s like student activists people, groups, organizations still prevalent /I mean can you name a student group here
[S11] I think we need to start them /like I tried to start something last year /I tried to start a debating club /no one was interested /not one person /ran it in the Greyhound /everything
[S9] Not surprised.
[S11] But that’s horrible.
[S9] I know and it is
[S11] It’s honestly /it’s a generational thing
[S10] Why did /Why did you guys choose Loyola?
[S11] I chose Loyola /Ok the people that I knew here /that I had met /they seemed like the kind of people /they seemed like /a lot of the friends that I’m friends with now, and a lot of the professors /I’m friends with my professors
[S10] Me too.
[S9] Yeah
[S11] And, a lot of people 
[S10] Which is a good quality of Loyola /small
[S11] My professors will talk about this stuff /a lot of my professors /but then some of the other classes I’ve taken are like /they won’t 
[S9] That’s who I talk about these issues with /is my professors
[S11] My psych class now, I tried to bring stuff up about self-injury and he’s like /my psych professor /I’m not gonna say who he is, but literally was just like well that’s you know an adolescent problem /and I’m very open with the fact that I have self-harmed for over eight years, and I still struggle with it and it’s an addiction that needs to be addressed, and I know people who are thirties and successful and have problems with self-harm /it’s like anything else, but my professor blew it off as an adolescent thing /and when someone who has a degree does that it makes it acceptable for kids who are our age to blow it off /to not care about the issues, and I think it’s not just our generation /it’s the generation above us that says, Ok only the things I care about are relevant so /it’s trickled down and I think it’s absolutely relevant to what we’re talking about because our parents didn’t fight about /again our parents don’t /they’re like Ok woman is supposed to come home and get married /or a man’s supposed to bring home the money /it’s trickled down from them to us, and since it’s not a problem with them, it’s not a problem for us /or to the majority of people anyway
[Do you have anything you want to say?]
[S12] Oh /um /I mean I agree with that /I mean the whole idea that the culture or generation perception doesn’t help any of these things /um it’s very true and we’ve all seen that /and I do agree with the fact that um things around here may be a bit more /um / minimalistic in approach like getting what needs to be done, done /as opposed to um 
[S10] Oh yeah /absolutely
[S12] Yeah, those larger areas of debate
[S11] You know the scary part that when it comes to gender things /I’ve actually had a discussion with my guy friends and they’re just like yeah well you know it really doesn’t exist /and I’m like are you kidding
[Laughter]
[S11] Like, you’re a bio major /you’re a chem. major /you’re an engineering major, and it doesn’t really exist? How many girls are in your class? Like
[S10] What is everyone’s major here?
[S11] A psych major with a photo minor
[S10] So psych major with a photo minor
[S9] History and Spanish
[S10] Double major?
[S9] Double major
[S12] Math and biochem
[S10] Double? /I’m a history major myself /but I / I think /my question would be um /you’re kind of in the same boat as me /the history department is strong /you have um like a lot of professors that you can get in touch with easily /you know have dinner with if you need to /meet them and understand them /um /this college is probably not 
[S11] Psych generally is a pretty good department here. Most of the professors aren’t idiots /so you know
[S10] My question for you though is I mean I didn’t /I didn’t know Loyola specifically strongly within those categories /within bio and chem., but um /I’ll give you the name, maybe you know him /my roommate Ryan Cunningham /you know who he is?
[S12] No, I don’t know.
[S10] He’s a biochem double major also /you probably have classes with him /um /probably I don’t know /anyhow I mean do you find that like it’s academically enriching and what you wanted it to be /for that major? /because I think most of the people here already come to school already with a plan /which is different from most schools /I think you go to college to find yourself /a lot of people here go here to be in Sellinger
[S11] Or in the psych department, or in the history department
[S10] Yeah, yeah, exactly
[S11] But, we have /we have good humanities /so
[S12] To be completely honest /um /uhh /like I talked to like through my scholarship they set up a mentoring thing, and there’s a guy from my high school who went here /um /Ken Mills /I think he graduated from here in 96 /um but generally doing the same thing that I was like um biology major /maybe chem. too, I don’t remember /but um /I talked to him ahead of time, and before I decided to come here and he had said that while he really enjoyed it here /and I do, I really do /um /for the people and everything /that at the same time he didn’t feel challenged in anyway /and I do somewhat agree with him /I mean with my math classes and my bio and my chem./ like my math class last semester /we in calc. three we had a good number of /the way I had it explained to me was that since we had a good deal of engineering students /the course wasn’t as rigorous or difficult as it could have been, but like we had exams in an hour and fifteen minutes or the extended class period on Tuesdays and Thursdays /those exams /um / like I would be able to get through them in about twenty minutes
[S10] Right
[S12] But, like our teacher /she would give us review problems that I couldn’t /I had no idea how to do, but I mean /like it sort of just made it seem as though /like the potential was there for that challenge, but 
[S10] But it doesn’t take you any further, is that what you’re saying?
[S12] It doesn’t. But, well at the same time it feels like that which needs to get done, will get done /provided that you care enough /um and like I feel sort of the same way about say the chem. department
[S11] Have you taken Dr. Moore yet? 
[S12] Um, no.
[S11] Wait. That’s all I have to say when it comes to chem.
[S12] Um, yeah /but yeah it’s very
[Alright, let’s stop there.]
