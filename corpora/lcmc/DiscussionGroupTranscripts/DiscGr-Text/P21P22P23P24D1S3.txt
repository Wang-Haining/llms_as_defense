GENDER/ SEX DISCRIMINATION

[Alright. You guys ready? [Do you feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the present day United States? And if so, what can we do to change this?
[S22] There’s still a big pay gap between men and woman
[S23] I think it’s still an issue / but it’s slowly / being fixed
[S21] Yea / I think / you’re right / there is a big pay gap / but still / like / I feel like you don’t see as many like / women CEOs / like you just don’t see a lot / of them
[S24] Yea / I think one of the primary reasons for that / is that / this is an issue that’s just starting to be addressed / and / to get to the CEO position
[S23] Yea
[S24] It takes decades / so / I think it’s in the process of correcting itself / and / maybe in the next couple of decades we’re gonna start to see that 
[S22] Also /cultural thing too
[S21] Right / and then you have the whole family issue
[S22] Cause like / I / I think / dudes are definitely more likely to promote dudes than chicks [Laughter] so if the dudes are the ones / I know I’m using like crappy language / but / ya know what I mean? It’s a self perpetuating thing
[S24] I don’t know / I really do feel like that’s starting to change
[S21] It is / yea 
[S22] Oh yea / well / cause / I think / education / has a lot to do with that
[S23] Definitely / like / there’s / I mean / there’s no opportunities growing up that women have different from men / I mean / as far as schooling goes / I mean / there’s all guys schools that are great and stuff / but there’s also all girls schools 
[S24] Just as great
[S23] Yea
[S22] I mean / in / in terms of education access / like / there are / big problems going on / but / they’re not along gender lines

[S23] Right / it’s mostly like

[S22] They’re along different kinds of lineations / but

[S23] Yea
[Do you want to just expand on that a little bit more?]

[S22] Yea / sure / um / by the time kids are nine / the ones in the suburbs can read at a level that’s 3 years higher than the ones in the city  / like / the Lower Marion school district in the suburbs of Philadelphia spends like $22,000 a year per pupil and the Philadelphia school district spends 9 / cause schools are funded for property taxes / so if you live in a place with mansions / they can / pay good schools / if you live in a place with / um / blocks and blocks and blocks and blocks and blocks and blocks of row homes with no electricity / like Baltimore / then / you end up having things like / 6% of kids who can pass a basic math test / 9% of kids who can pass a basic literacy 

[S23] Yea

[S22] Cause that happened / last year

[S23] Wow

[S22] Cause property / yea / cause / just the system feeds property taxes into the schools

[S24] That’s interesting / I thought I saw something in the paper / where / the city schools actually beat the county schools / on / um / standardized tests / just recently / like / I thought I saw it / but maybe it would have just been cities versus / yea / I didn’t read far into it

[S22] They did / oh really? It might have been charter schools.

[S23] Wow

[S22] Cause / the / Maryland was the first state to step in under “No Child Left Behind” / and as a state take over municipal schools / and they did / and they turned them over to private investors / and they made charter schools out of them / which was a real good move / and those schools are doing good

[S24] I just saw where they’re gonna expand them actually

[S22] Oh yea?

[S24] I think to more / I think Towson University is actually going to be taking over some of it

[S22] Yea / yea / Towson is gonna be doing a bunch of it / because those schools then have to compete in the free market / because every pupil that goes there / the state / or / the city / gives that school a voucher for a certain amount of money

[S24] Subsidization

[S22] Yea / so / if you have private investors / they’re gonna try and make their money back / so they’re gonna try and do that through quality of education / so it’s like
[S24] Fixes itself

[S22] Yea / it’s a very healthy thing 

[S23] Not a bad idea to commercialize education

[S22] Well / I mean / it commercializes it / but it still publicizes it / cause it’s still publicly funded

[S23] Right

[S22] But people are just competing in a healthy way

[S23] Right / that’s a pretty good idea

[S22] Yea

[So you don’t feel that gender discrimination is as much of an issue as like / socioeconomic factors or things like that?]

[S21] No / no / I don’t think so

[S22] No / not as much of

[S23] Definitely not in education 

[S22] It’s still an issue / but not as much of / in educational access / if that’s what we’re talking about

[S23] Right

[S22] Cause you can just as easily be born a boy as a girl / right?

[S23] Yea

[S21] Uh-huh / like / it’ll still always being going / but / I think / it’s being / getting a lot better

[S23] Yea 

[S24] Agreed

[S23] I feel like / um / they compliment / accomplishments of women are being a lot more celebrated to / like in the newspaper / you would hear / like / it would be front page news if a woman makes CEO / as opposed to a guy

[S21] Uh-huh

[S23] And / I mean / that’s / it’s kinda turning the other way / cause people want to highlight about how non-gender discriminatory they’re being / and 

[S21] And like / a lot more women / are obviously going to school / I mean / like / like / the average / I mean / the average / age / for a women / to / like / start a family / I know / went up / even / like / a lot 

[S23] Yea

[S21] And like / even / maybe to like / low 30s / so / I don’t know / cause of all the schooling they have to go through to get to where they want to be

[S23] Right / and I mean / even / like / almost all of the colleges I looked at were at least like 60-40 / girls to guys 

[S21] [Laughter] / I know that’s what it’s like here

[S23] Yea / so I mean / it’s not like women aren’t being educated / and / becoming part of the workforce

[S21] Uh-huh

[S24] When I / um / in my organizational behavior class / they were just discussing gender issues among other diversity issues / and really / up until like the 1980s early 90s / that was a huge problem in the workplace / as far as / women / not 

[S21] Yea

[S24] The industry they highlighted was the financial industry / especially where / masculinity completely takes over / I was just shocked to hear how recent of an issue that really was

[S21] Yea

[S22] Oh yea 

[S24] But / I really think all the lawsuits that came out of that / are what / caused so much change

[S22] Yea / right

[S24] And that’s what really / um / not only propelling the movement forward / that’s also that’s why you’re seeing / that celebrated / that the females are / reaching the CEO roles

[S23] Yea

[S22] Have you / um / heard of Betty Friedan? The Feminist Mystique / the book 
[S23] Yea

[S24] Oh / yea / yea / yea

[S22] Yea / I don’t know / during the Cold War / there were / like / it was just like the culture / was / the man works / the woman stays at home / the man should want nothing more than to provide for his family / and the woman should want for nothing more than the husband with a secure / and / 2.4 children and whatever [Laughter] and like / that was just like / everyone’s deal / and then Betty Friedan did the whole / almost like reinstating the draft for Iraq thing / only she was just like / wake up / you’re not this stupid / you’re worth something too ladies / so

[S21] Right

[S22] And / so / then / like / it’s progressing in a good direction

[S21] Yea

[S23] The thing is / I feel like it’s gone in cycles throughout history / where women have like cared what status they had / and then / they settled down

[S21] Yea

[S23] And then they cared again / cause with like women’s voting and stuff / and I know back in like / back during like / the civil war / and after that / in a period of abolition and stuff / I mean / there were women who were going along with that movement / saying / hey / we’re working for these rights for slaves / lets also work for our own rights / and then / like / so many years later / in 1920 / right to vote / and then / the whole 50s and 60s era / of the stay at home mom / who cooks and / doesn’t / I wonder how many of those women voted / and now / all of a sudden it’s important again / in the last / 20 years / so I don’t know / maybe once we’re CEOs / guys will get some / we’ll settle down [laughter] and guys will reach a higher level than that / and then / we’ll have to catch up again / I don’t know why that goes like that

[S21] Hm 

[S22] I mean / there’s progress going on [Laughter] / I mean / it might not be / like / quick and all at once / aside from / milestones like suffrage / and stuff like that / but / there’s progress going on / ya know / which is good

[S23] Uh-huh / it is / I just think it’s funny that there’s huge gaps of time where no one seems to care

[S21] I think that’s true

[Laughter]

[S21] I’ve seen that
[What do you think / um / we could do about the discrimination that still does exist? Gender discrimination / to change it]

[S24] I think we’re already / on the right track / and / maybe / I’m / prime example / just bring it up / that it’s already in our education system / you tend to see schools already working out / especially / in your business classes / diversity is a pretty hot topic / I know / um / part of the scholars program / for the / the business school / and they spend / a whole year / it’s part of their / um / Sellinger scholars experience

[S21] Uh-huh

[S24] First year / it’s just all diversity / alone / that’s / that’s how big they think it’s / becoming an issue / in the / just important from a management standpoint / you have to be able to recognize it / recognize that there are different viewpoints / different ways of communicating / for a while / women wouldn’t be / um / promoted / because / their way of communication wasn’t really / perceived as / confidence / from a male / when it was just a different way of communicating / that has nothing to do with confidence / I think education is just the key thing / you gotta educate the people who are gonna be out in the workforce / dealing with it / and / those people haven’t quite reached / or gotten far enough in / that’s why I think we are gonna see the positive / um / effects / in a couple of decades

[S21] I mean / even at this school / like / I know diversity is shoved down our throat / like / I hear / like / every / I mean / I remember in orientation / like / diversity diversity diversity / everything / and / um / like / I’m gonna be an RA next year / and / um / that was one of the big things / like going into like / when they / came to choosing who was actually gonna do it / um / diversity was a big thing / because / there were a lot more / um / girls than guys / and / um / they knew / that like / they had to put like / a girl on a floor and a boy on a floor / and stuff like that

[S22] Well / it’s / um / ideally / it’s really important to talk about it / especially / to at least talk about it / if not implement it / especially in places where there’s none of it

[S21] Uh-huh

[S22] like / this school is 92% Caucasian / and / there are a lot of other schools which are the same way

[S21] Yea

[S22] And I mean / the reasons for that aside / I feel like / if kids go to a really good school that it’s sorta / homogenous like that / and those kids are gonna be wielding power / of one type or another some day / it’s increasingly important that / they / kinda / poke the bubble / or start to poke it / a little bit

[S23] That’s true / it is kind of shoved down our throats here / but / I mean / I think it serves to remind us / that not every place in the world is like this

[S21] Right

[S23] And I mean / in four years / you’re not gonna be / in a / work force that’s 90% Caucasian anymore / or 60% women / or

[S21] Not in America [Laughter]

[S23] Yea. I actually think a lot of it has to do with / um / a lot of the / um / the / cultural change that’s going towards the approval of women being in power now / has a lot to do with like the media and TV / cause / even on like sitcoms now / the woman has a job / and / it’s not Leave it to Beaver [Laughter] / and / you can like / they show women in like / high office positions / and it just gets people used to it / like / from a very young age / and it’s like / hey / this is acceptable / and / it’s cool / so / I think people just don’t think of it as much when they see it everyday

[S24] I think it’s a pretty huge marketing strategy / because people are starting to realize / we’re missing half the audience out there

[S21] Yea

[S23] Uh-huh

[S24] And if you can start / hitting that / whether it’s just your product or your TV show / of course it’s gonna do better / cause you’re appealing to 50% more

[S21] Right

[Do you guys ever feel that men are discriminated against? Either in the workplace or otherwise?]

[S21] Um

[S24] I think everyone’s really discriminated on / sometime in their life / for something or other

[S23] Yea

[S24] I just don’t think the effects / of discrimination on men / is readily shown in society / clearly / it hasn’t affected positions within companies or anything like that

[S21] Yea

[S24]  But / I mean / of course / everyone’s discriminated against

[S21] Like / I’m sure / like / males that want to be nurses / I’m sure that’s not like

[S23] Yea

[S21] Really socially accepted / or like / interior decorators / or / things of that / I don’t / things of that nature / I really don’t / think that / like / that’s something that goes over real well / but 

[S23] And even / I mean / you were saying that guys promote guys more often than they promote women / well / women probably promote women more often than they promote men

[S22] Yea

[S23] Because of / as you were saying / the communication thing / we understand how we communicate better / so / I mean / yea / there’s / I think there is / but / I don’t know / even with the interior decorator thing / I think / shows like Queer Eye and stuff

[S21] Yea

[S23] Are bringing it more out / and / you just don’t think as much of it

[S21] Uh-huh / I think you just don’t think about it as much as / like / because / there’s just not so much of a history of it / like 

[S23] Yea

[S21] Like men / in / well / way back / have never been / really / discriminated against / like women have / so I feel like that’s just the reason that women are more focused on 

[S23] Yea

[What do you guys think about this? [Laughter] About men being discriminated against / Do you have any thoughts about that?]

[S24] Um / I mean / I really / already said that / I mean / I think / they do / everybody gets discriminated against / you can always pick out a / particular situation where someone’s discriminated against / I just don’t think the repercussions are really there for men

[S22] I mean / not as much / not to the point where I think / that as a social problem / it should take priority / over the other way around 

[S21] Hm / I [inaudible]

[S22] I mean / like / I / I might get discriminated against / if I / go to / like / Zimbabwe [Laughter] / and I walk down the street / um / and / then / people would have all these kind of untested cultural assumptions they’d bring to me / like / oh / ya know / like / or like / when I went to Jamaica / like when I got a job down there / I was working there / it was like that / um / cause / it’s like / oh / this kid’s white / American / yea / he’s loaded / obviously / just cause he / had the money to fly here / so / he’s gotta be / and that was kind of an untested assumption / um / but I don’t feel like that deserves / or requires as much attention as / the other way around / as like / as like a society where / say / ya know / men are holding / just happen to be a lot more CEOs / and they’re holding that power / and / they are bringing / and / it’s more institutionalized / ya know

[S21] Uh-huh

[Any other thoughts come to mind / gender discrimination / you don’t seem to really think it’s an issue that much anymore]

[S21] No [Laughter]

[S24] I mean / it’s an issue / but / we all feel like it’s working itself out and / slowly turning around / things aren’t really just gonna happen overnight 

[S21] Yea

[S23] Yea / the lawsuits are definitely helping that 

[S22] And they’re getting public attention to it

[S23] They are

[Do you want to just explain a little bit more about what you just said?]

[S23] Um / ok / well I mean / before / there were / there were laws against discrimination in the workplace and stuff / but they weren’t really enforced / and people started / calling them out on that / calling out companies / and being like / hey / you can’t do this / and hiring lawyers / and fighting it / and / that not only hit companies where their money was / it also brought / um / issues of discrimination into the eye of the public / which / created a whole chain effect / which caused other women to maybe realize that they weren’t being treated fairly / and / brought the whole thing into a new level 

[Anyone have any reactions to that?]

[Any personal experiences with anything like that? Anything?]

[S23] Well / no

[Laughter]

[Why don’t you think?]

[S24] I have a personal experience I’ll share.  I think / um / the place / I have an internship at / um / PHH / it’s a place out on [inaudible] / I don’t know if you guys know about it / but / I found it really interesting that I when went there / I mean / this is / it’s a fleet leasing company / it had a lot to do with cars / so the stereotype is / there are gonna be like 90% guys working there / but / it’s the complete opposite / I think there’s like 70 girls / 70% women / and / 30% men / at the department I was working in / there’s 7 supervisors / and then a director / the director is a woman / 6 of the supervisors were women / there was one man / so / I mean / not to say I was surprised / I just thought that interesting / cause / you’d hear all this hype in school / that it’s such a problem / and I got there / I was like / maybe men are being discriminated against [laughter] / that was just a joke at the end

[Laughter]

[S24] I just found that interesting.

[S22] That seems like a big step in the right direction / right?

[Laughter]

[Ok. Do you guys have any other thoughts on this topic? I didn’t think so / ok /  end of discussion.]
