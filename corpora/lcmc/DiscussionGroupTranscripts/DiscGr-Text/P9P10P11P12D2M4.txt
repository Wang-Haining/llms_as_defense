MARIJUANA
[Alright /the city of Denver has decided to legalize small amounts of marijuana for persons over 21, how do you guys feel about this?]
[S11] Well it kinda seems to me it’s the same kind of thing as alcohol /it’s a drug /use it safely, if you’re gonna use it at all /there are problems with it, but there are problems with almost anything /so whatever
[S12] Was it legalized just in the sense of medical usage?
[Um, personal use /small amounts for personal use]
[S12] Is that related to medicine, or?
[Oh, I think just recreational. That’s what it refers to.]
[S9] I wonder what a small amount is.
[Laughter]
[S12] Cause I mean like I know it’s used to /it could be used to decrease like ocular pressure in glaucoma patients and /uh / [inaudible] /like to treat nausea among cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, and just to alleviate pain in general /um /like one of the things they say is that it’s less toxic or it’s not as potent as other drugs /um /that’s one of the arguments for it /um/but at the same time the people who used it in Nevada /or something I’m not sure /who did the glaucoma study /noted that the pressure didn’t drop too, too dramatically when compared to other prescription medication, and there were still some side effects
[S10] To pot?
[S12] Hmm?
[S10] To /to smoking?
[S12] To smoking marijuana for the glaucoma.
[S10] Glaucoma
[S11] Let’s be completely honest though /it’s a drug like anything else, how can you really differentiate between smoking tobacco and smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol? It’s all /well not really so much tobacco, but it’s all mind-altering, so where do you draw that line?
[S9] Well tobacco can kill you and I mean it’s been documented that gosh /how many people have died from lung cancer caused by smoking for their entire life and that’s legal and there have been no deaths attributed to marijuana use /but there’s been tons attributed to alcohol usage /both alcohol and tobacco /um / are legal for people of a certain age
[S12] Well, in terms of like lung cancer /uh /I read /we just did this in psych /um 
[S10] You just did the drug unit in psych?
[S12] Yeah /um / that marijuana /um /by itself like /isn’t as toxic as other things, but in terms of smoking it /since it’s retained in the lungs longer than say just regular cigarette smoke that it can be more potent as a carcinogen /and lead to high rates in lung cancer
[S10] And also you don’t /just you don’t /there’s no like /you wouldn’t take tobacco out of a cigarette and put it in like a four foot glass chamber and bring it in /you know what I mean /so like you have /uh also /just to go off the medical reasons /I know people /um /one of my roommates has um /a stress related testing condition that he um /he got in trouble at our school and they put him on drug testing because he got caught when he was a freshman and they /they cut off the drug testing cause he got cleared medically to smoke for /so they couldn’t test him /for stress purposed /he had chronic anxiety /they let him /uh /they let him /they don’t drug test him I guess, even though he should be getting drug-tested /so not saying go out and smoke, just turning a blind eye I guess you’d say
[S11] I don’t know I guess it just seems to me /where you really draw that line because alcohol is a mind-altering drug /it’s considered a drug /you know /it’s not considered just a liquid /it’s a drug and it’s mind altering, and it’s /it alters you physically so why is pot any more bad /I mean I still think it’s kind of a personal choice /or it should be anyway
[S10] I think these are two totally different things /personally
[S11] But, how?
[S10] In terms of like your functioning /the way you function on both /it’s like I mean part of what makes alcohol so detrimental is that violence that it invokes, the decision process like up to /the places you’ll be when you’re making the decisions that you are when you’re on alcohol /and pot /it’s like two completely different entities /when people recreationally smoke pot they do so in the comfort of their own home or in the backyard
[S11] Not necessarily.
[S10] In America, they do.
[S11] Not necessarily, I know like 
[S10] Well the don’t go to bars and do it and they don’t go to work and do it on like their breaks like you’d find an alcoholic doing.
[S11] So, then why is alcohol /why should alcohol be legal and pot not?
[S10] It’s legal when you’re 21 years-old, that’s not legal forever.
[S11] Exactly /what I’m saying is why? It doesn’t make sense. It’s kind of an oxymoron.
[S10] No, it’s not an oxymoron /that’s 
[S11] It’s oxymoronic in the fact that /what you’re saying is there’s all these problems with alcohol that are right /they do it during their lunch breaks, why is it legal?
[S10] Why is alcohol legal?
[S11] Yeah, why should it be legal?
[S10] Well, it wasn’t for a while and then like the largest bootleg thing in our country, and it was a stupid /it was stupid to make it illegal so they cut their losses, they made it legal, it’s a massive industry /um /just like pot would be except for it wouldn’t necessarily be the type of thing /cause you can’t /the type of people that pot then produces /like if you have your stoner, per say /and your drunk /the difference between the two of them would be completely
[S11] I don’t think there’s much of a difference.
[S10] I think there is.
[S11] I know alcoholics and I know stoners, and it doesn’t seem like there’s much of a difference in their quote activity.
[S9] Well, what kind of difference? Like what do you notice?
[S10] I think with stoners, you see like a loss of like what made you who you are /because all it does is it stops your whole mental /you mental /uh /what’s it called? /uh, production /like where /where you would be /not production /uh /growth like where you start smoking pot every day, that’s when you’re mental /you know /like that’s why people who smoke a lot of pot play a lot of video games in college and they watch a lot of stupid cartoons and stuff like that /because that’s what /that’s what a 10th grader in high school when they probably started the 9th or 12th or whatever grade /that’s what they’d be doing 
[S11] But, the problem is that when you’re doing it all the time /the same with the problem of alcohol or any other drug 
[S10] No, but like it’s /it’s not
[S11] It is!
[S9] Well, if I may say, I think the law said that you had to be over 21 to do 
[S10] Did the law say 21? Ok, well that’s fine.
[S11] But, it’s all the same /the problem is when you overuse something /it’s not /if you smoke pot once a month
[S10] But, see I don’t think you can necessarily overuse pot in the same way you overuse alcohol.
[S11] Oh, I think absolutely you can.
[S10] Not me. You can’t.
[Did you want to jump in?]
[S12] Well, was it a moderate usage of marijuana or /would that even be possible to like say /like there are social /like norms or conventions you could say that like could gage would acceptable drinking is or a moderate amount of it
[S10] Well you’d get sick. You can only drink so much until you get sick or pass out.
[S11] Well you’d do the same thing with /and people still go past it
[S10] If you go past alcohol poisoning you’re doing so in a comatose state.
[S11] Not necessarily
[S10] Sure
[S11] If you have alcohol poisoning you’re not in a coma /not necessarily
[S10] Well, if you go past alcohol poisoning, I don’t know where you go from there.
[S11] But, I’m saying that’s not /that’s not even socially acceptable /that’s just medically /you saying socially acceptable, and I think absolutely there will be limits on /like people /if you smoke pot every day people look down on you, just if you drink alcohol all the time /people look down on you /it’s definitely /there are ways of doing it socially acceptable /I mean think of it in a college situation /everybody has a friend who smoked pot at least once or twice or does it once a month or you know a couple of times a month /but /and then everybody has that friend that does it all the time or that at least knows someone, but it’s the same way with alcohol /I don’t think there’s a difference
[S10] Yeah, but alcohol you /per say at Loyola the two different demographics you’re talking about /the alcoholic demographic you would say starts drinking at what time? After school /they don’t go drunk to class /they might still be drunk from the night before but never at class
[S11] So, why are you saying that /so you’re saying that 
[S10] But, people smoke and go to class all the time.
[S11] Yeah, but people go drunk all the time because they’ve still drunk from the night before /so there’s really no difference
[S10] That’s like the /uh /residual effect
[S11] And again it’s a personal thing
[S10] Yeah, but
[S11] It’s a personal thing /if somebody makes a stupid decision that’s their decision, but it’s /it should be their decision
[S10] I mean I would go out and venture off to say that minimum /minimum /ten percent of Loyola /there’s 4,000 kids here /3,300 kids here? 
[S9] Something like that.
[S10] 3,300 /what’s ten percent? Could you give me ten percent of that real quick?
[S12] Of what?
[S10] 3,300
[S11] 330
[S10] 330? At least that people smoke pot every day at Loyola.
[S11] I don’t agree.
[S10] I could tell it /I mean /oh God
[S11] I know, I know
[Alright, [inaudible] break this up a little bit]
[S10] We say whatever we want in here right?
[Yeah, you can but /um /just like]
[S10] Alright, you go ahead first.
[Yeah]
[S12] Well, like I’m pretty /uh /I don’t really know that many people /I mean I’ve seen drunk people around /I mean it’s common /and people who I didn’t think were drunk but probably were drunk /um /[laughter] /fewer people who smoke marijuana /but, I hear that I do, but I haven’t actually ever seen them actually stoned /probably have /but, I don’t know
[S10] It’s also harder to tell when somebody’s high than if they’re drunk also 
[S9] Yeah
[S10] I mean that’s /there’s no argument with that /I mean
[S9] Something that I’ve been wondering about /uh / people are allowed to have certain amounts /small amounts of marijuana for personal use /how do they go about getting it and would that /I know /cause some people talk about how it’ll combat drug trafficking and things like that /well, if it /I’m assuming it would still be illegal to sell
[S11] In California, there are places where you can go /I know at least in California, I think in Arizona and New Mexico as well /um /there are places that do sell it for medical usage and they have all different strains /Ok /I hate to say it /have you seen the show Weeds? /you know exactly the show I’m talking about 
[S10] Yeah, yeah
[S11] Those are all over. It’s like a store, it’s like a bakery almost even /where you can just go
[S10] That’s [inaudible] /it’s so risky though because you can just go /and it’s just really easy to get into that circle of medical marijuana usage
[S11] Right /oh, absolutely
[S10] And that’s why they /they don’t want to [inaudible]
[S11] But, I also think that it’s the same situation I think /when it comes to the way I look at alcohol and the difference /you know between America and Europe /you can drink when you’re 16 in Europe and you don’t drive until you’re 18 because you don’t know how to handle things then, and it’s the same kind of thing if it was legal /you’d know how to handle it /it wouldn’t be something you’d be able to abuse as easily /I think
[S10] Abuse as easily, you said?
[S11] I think, but that’s my /that’s, that’s the way I was raised, so that’s the way I see alcohol /I don’t /I don’t drink /I’ll drink /I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner, but I will not drink something that tastes horrible /I find out my roommate /my friend’s roommate was 21 when I go to visit her /I’m like, oh good, I can use wine to cook! That’s my first reaction. I don’t drink, so that’s just /just the different way I was raised
[S9] And I think that should be /I mean attached to a law like that /the same kind of restrictions that go along with alcohol
[S11] Absolutely
[S10] The only problem with that law is so somebody has like a [inaudible] at their house and they’re just pinching off a gram so they can legally carry it around /so they bring as much as they need out in public, but in actuality they’re holding as much as they want
[S11] And, it feels like what you’re saying is that somebody that smokes pot /they’re gonna be a degenerate
[S10] No, no I don’t /I mean 
[S11] That’s what it seems like.
[S10] I don’t consider myself a degenerate /you know I’ve probably habitually smoked marijuana since I was /uh /in 10th grade, and I can tell you like perfectly that it has definitely had an effect on my athletic career /I think I could directly attribute it to why I don’t play college basketball, and why I play tennis here /and if we got drug tested, I’d probably get kicked off the team /much like most of the athletes at Loyola /if their team gets picked, they go to GNC /they get their sixty five dollar of whatever, and I mean there’s /drug testing isn’t like a [inaudible] thing, but there is an entire community /and I wouldn’t even call it underground community /you guys will see it around Friday on campus /of kids that smoke pot all the time/they come in blue and
[S11] That’s their choice.
[S10] Oh, absolutely.
[S9] So, if it’s so present and prevalent already when it’s
[S10] And this is a conservative school too, by the way.
[S9] illegal /I mean what can the /what can the difference be if it’s made legal /small amounts? /like do you think they’ll be any difference if so many people do it already
[S10] Um /I think we /what you would see is a decline in the people that smoke it habitually right now, because they do so because not everybody else does, and it’s something you can kinda get into, and you find your own group of friends /it’s kind of like a way to meet people /especially in college, when you get here freshman year /you find out who you have similar /you know drinking or smoking or /um different /it’s just like it’s own club, but /like a Loyola club, you know what I’m saying? /And, so like /but, I also think that if it was legal you would have less /less incidents at Loyola of kids getting drunk and throwing chairs out their windows /which has happened at Newman a couple of times this year /and less fights /people get burned out and they don’t go out /you get less drunk problems
[S11] Here’s my thing. There is a massive drinking community at Loyola.
[S10] Oh yeah, absolutely.
[Laughter]
[S11] Massive.
[S12] Oh yeah.
[S9] Mmhmm.
[S10] That would be cut.
[S11] So why is that /there are people who go out Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday /drink in their rooms /like it’s the same thing /there are just as many people who drink every day
[S9] Wait, so it seems like you’re saying that if it was made legal that it would actually 
[S10] I think it would help /it would cut down on the amount of /um /the amount of 
[S12] Over-use?
[S10] The amount of over-use /yeah /I mean because then it /you get it /the whole hiding it thing /it’s more in the open /if it’s more /um /socially acceptable
[S11] See, I thought you were arguing against it.
[S10] Against pot?
[S11] Against the legality of it
[S10] No, I mean /I’m not really sure how I feel about legalizing it /I know it’s /I think its effects /I don’t think its effects would be detrimental to our society /the only thing I do say /I think about pot though /um / which, which would definitely be a problem /is people wanna say it’s not a gateway drug
[S11] Oh, absolutely it is.
[S10] You know, but people /but I mean 
[S11] You can say that about anything.
[S10] Yeah, but people is /and that’s what I’m saying /you could say it about anything, but the kids at our school that drink /you could narrow it down to like maybe one or two percent of them /or a very small fraction that have done like /well I don’t want to say at our school, but your average school /people our age, people that do coke, people that take shrooms
[S11] It’s big.
[S10] Things like that.
[S11] It’s big.
[S9] Well, the thing is you don’t know /I guess you know some people would say if you make marijuana legal then if people were just doing it because it was illegal and it was /you know something /um /like would they just move on to /uh /more potent drugs that would remain illegal
[S10] That’s what it does /I mean it really honestly /like the effects you see it has on
[S11] But, it’s also a really personal thing because /I don’t know /I’ve /I smoke pot
[S10] Mmhmm.
[S11] And, I’m not a cracked out loser /I mean I go to class /with the exception of today where I pulled two all-nighters in a row so I didn’t go to class today /Ok /it’s not like I was smoking pot all night
[S10] No, no /absolutely not /and you have to define a medium /I mean you could 
[S11] But, that’s with anything /so why should /I mean just like if we have things like alcohol that are illegal /honestly, I don’t see why this shouldn’t be /to be dead honest /I thought you were arguing against it
[S10] No, I’m really not /I’m not for it or against it /I’m against its effects on, on, on successful /not successful /but people that have a life ahead of them
[S11] I’m not saying it’s a good thing.
[S10] I think 21 would be a good age to make it, but then in that case it has to be way, way, way harder to get it before you’re 21.
[S9] Well, like alcohol /it’s so easy to get it before you’re 21
[S11] Yeah! My 16 year-old brother/ my 16 year-old brother /I went home for Easter and my 16 year-old brother can get alcohol quicker than I can /like
[S10] Right, but like I’m saying if it was legal the regulation of it would be like
[S11] It’s the same thing
[S10] I think it would be a lot harder to get it /um /but
[S11] Oh, I think they would start to regulate it, so there would be a regulation so it wouldn’t be
[S10] Right, and there would be a regulation 
[S11] Like alcohol /but, it’s /it’s still like they really can’t regulate it because people are gonna sell it anyway
[S10] Yeah, I know.
[S11] It’s like anything /like alcohol /exactly /it’s a regulated system, so probably less people get it that are underage then not /then if it wasn’t regulated, but
[S12] Like even with regulation /like that’s part /maybe I missed it, but were you saying that with stronger regulation that we wouldn’t have as many people doing it underage?
[S11] Yeah, I mean there’s still gonna be people doing it /it’s just gonna not be quite as many
[S12] The I don’t /again I don’t remember where I got this statistic /um /but, uh /from what I read it’s that /uh /there’s more of an appeal to people who like can’t legally access it or shouldn’t be able to /um / I think the term was /it’s forbidden fruit appeal /um 
[S11] Well, that’s absolutely true. I mean look at the way kids in the U.S. drink at /in their teenage years compared to the way kids in Europe do /I mean it’s /most families /I know I cam to college and I talk about how I’d have a glass of wine at dinner with my family since I was about 8 /like I’d have a little mini glass of wine because I /it adds to the flavor of the food /there was horror on some of my friends’ faces because they’re like I don’t drink, I’m not allowed to drink /there was never alcohol /a drop of alcohol in my house /my Mom didn’t even use it to cook /it’s a completely different view /it’s definitely something that’s forbidden and that’s tempting, especially to a teenager’s mind /and I think that if /like and even in Europe it’s 16 for beer and wine /now in almost all of Europe /I think it’s not in Czechoslovakia /I think you can get anything and in Belgium you can get anything at 16 /anywhere else it’s beer and wine at 16 and hard liquor at 18 /but you also can’t drive until you’re 18 /almost anywhere in Europe, and you /they have this /this gap where you learn to deal with things before
[S10] People don’t drive as much in general though, right?
[S11] Uhh /depends on where you are /like um /my cousin’s best friend lives out in the country in Germany /they drive everywhere
[S9] Although, still I think even in the United States which is [inaudible] /suburbs /things like that where /I mean our society is really so much more based on cars
[S11] Just in general /well and also they have much better public transportation systems
[S9] Even in cities /you know /American cities are so divided into residential and work and, and as opposed to a European city
[S11] I live in New York City, so it’s the only city-city in the states I’ve been in /I tend to stay there /um /but, it /so I don’t really know /I get what you’re saying with the residential /cause I guess in Baltimore I can see what you’re saying, but like
[S9] But even so, just like in general /like
[S11] Yeah, no, I can see what you’re saying, but I still think absolutely the forbidden fruit thing /I think it’s a problem /I think it adds to the problem
[S12] So, you’d say that with /um /by lowering /or just having regulation to begin with /um /that would reduce that?
[S11] Yeah I think it’s /I mean with it being legal it kind of /you’re not rebelling against anyone if you’re smoking pot now, and I mean a lot of people go to drink and smoke pot when they’re a kid cause you know they’re going against the man /you know? /kinda thing /but, you’re not anymore if it’s legal /does that make sense?
[S9] But, then again you’re probably going to have the same problems with underage usage that you have with alcohol.
[S11] Right, but it’s still gonna be a lesson because it’s actually regulated.
[S10] I think if it’s legal /I think you would have /you would have like more kids getting into their parent’s pot, more /like you know /they’re gonna find their parent’s liquor /like you would more /I think more situations where younger kids would be smoking
[S11] There’s pros and cons to every situation though /to everything
[S10] So, I’m saying though this would be a major con and I think you would have a lot more younger kids smoking pot if it was legal /and it would be /there’d be commercials or there would be /I mean you open up a whole new can of worms /people would be /there would be like, hey /like this guy’s got the best /like the best brewery or 
[S11] They already do.
[S10] But, it’s not like out there in the open /and people don’t talk about it
[S11] It’s not out there in the open and people don’t talk about it /really?
[S10] I mean is it taboo? Is it kosher, I should say /to name your drug dealer in front of people? /No, you can’t do that. You can’t even use first names with people because you can get them arrested.
[S11] But, honestly I don’t think /it’s honestly not that detrim- /it’s not a drug /it’s on the level with alcohol, it’s not on the level with cocaine and heroin and angle dust and PCP and
[S12] Well the thing to consider /like continuing along with the potential concept /I mean it’s completely speculative, but my /like we have alcohol already, but if you were to legalize marijuana even in a limited dosage /um /there’s a potential for that setting some sort of precedent, which might lead other drug users to call for at least some level of legalization to that /another substance, which may in fact be more deadly than pot
[S11] I don’t think it would be /there’s any way that /any drug that I can think of wouldn’t even be /I don’t think there’s enough of a /I don’t want to say following /I mean /cause there are people who use drugs habitually
[S9] But, not enough of like a widespread usage.
[S11] Exactly, it’s honestly /pot is seen /let’s be honest to kids of our generation /pot’s seen like tobacco, it’s seen like a cigarette /let’s be dead honest here
[S10] I don’t think so.
[S11] The majority of kids I know /oh pot? Ok, whatever /like you smoke pot, whatever, that’s fine
[S10] Yeah, but that’s also like college too though. Out of college /not so much
[S11] Oh, really? You don’t think so?
[S10] Oh, I think for the first couple of years out of college people are trying to make themselves /uh /in the real world and would probably /if not /they would not necessarily say they’re gonna cut it out completely, but you would absolutely like /you know lower your intake of it, and then before college /you’re trying to get into college
[S11] I don’t know people do the same thing /fight with alcohol /try to say the same thing with alcohol
[S10] Not to mention, this is a whole /this is another thing /if pot’s legal and alcohol is legal /you’d have more people doing both together which is /which in itself makes people entirely act different than one or the other /and more sick
[S11] I think you can’t have one legal and one not /I don’t think it makes sense because I think they’re the same sort of drug
[S10] And when you smoke, you can /if /it messes with your tolerance, and you’re able to drink more, and you get sicker /and you make worse decisions /I think it’s great pot’s not illegal /I mean not legal right now, and as somebody who smokes it, I don’t think it should be legal either
[S11] I don’t know. I’m gonna disagree with you.
[S9] Has anyone /cause I never heard of about this until this study /did anyone hear about this?
[S11] I did.
[S9] I mean did you read anything else about it /like have you
[S11] I haven’t read anything else about it, I heard it from a friend of mine /so
[S10] On Friday, at Boulder University /Colorado /they have /uh /they have /it’s a massive college, right? /Well they have one of the largest quads there, it’s like a couple football fields combined /they’ll be a couple thousand kids there and everybody will be doing it /I mean you’ll see /it’s gonna be a cloud visible from like /visible from like outside of Colorado /it’s /it’s crazy, and like Colorado in itself is
[S11] I honestly think it’s the same thing as with alcohol, and with cigarettes /it’s a personal choice, and I think it should /if you’re gonna have alcohol legal /there’s no reason for pot not to be legal /there’s no reason
[S10] I mean, I think we’re naming some pretty good reasons /personally
[S11] I don’t see that /they don’t seem like reasons because they /then by that right /then alcohol should be illegal /for the same reasons that you’re saying about pot /then alcohol should be illegal
[S10] Umm /no, we’re saying because we already have one
[S11] There’s no reason, there the same thing so why can people switch them out /it’s a personal choice
[S9] Although /although if I can just say that moderate amounts of alcohol have proven to be helpful in medical ways
[S10] Your heart
[S11] Let me tell you something. My friend took the SAT’s /once stoned, once not /aced the SAT when he was stoned /aced it
[S10] That’s /oh God
[S11] No, I’m sorry /it’s just /it happens
[S10] No
[S12] That could just be
[S10] That’s just, that’s just like total garbage though /it does not help you think clear /it blocks off parts of your brain and opens emotional parts of your brain
[S12] Just to play devil’s advocate /kind of /in a factual sense /that could be just purely anecdotal and just a fluke
[S11] Absolutely it could be a fluke, but it could be a fluke that there’s nothing /there’s no studies that have been done about it that there have been with alcohol, so we have no idea /and the be honest
[S12] Well, studies that /I’m sorry
[S11] No, go ahead.
[S12] Studies that do what, per say?
[S11] I don’t know. It’s not my field.
[S12] But, were you talking about testing or
[S11] I was just talking about studies about like a glass of red wine a day /it helps your heart
[S10] Like a joint a day, doesn’t help you.
[S11] I’m not saying it does, I’m not saying /but most people don’t stick to one glass of wine a day.
[S9] But, then again, you know, cigarettes don’t help you at all. It just harms you.
[S10] I mean
[S11] I don’t think that it /I don’t think it /I haven’t smoked in three years /I’m not gonna lie, but personally, it’s one of those things where I just don’t see the reason for it being illegal if alcohol and cigarettes are legal /because you’re just /they’re harmful to you, and so /what’s the point of having those legal and one not just arbitrarily /because that’s what it seems like /it’s arbitrary alcohol’s legal and marijuana’s not /it could be the other way around just as easily
[S9] Do you know any other harmful effects /you know how you were talking about it’s more potent in the long /than cigarettes
[S12] Um, cigarettes
[S11] There are also people that smoke cigarettes without filters.
[S12] True, but /um /another thing that /like this /in terms of the factual stuff /um /it’s been know to /marijuana /umm/ had been known to suppress the immune system /um
[S10] Absolutely, and it messes with your sick patterns cause I know the whole like neurotransmitter /I don’t know I think it’s serotonin or dopamine /one of the two /marijuana completely messes with your brain’s
[S11] I think it’s dopamine.
[S10] Dopamine?
[S11] Dopamine is sleeping, serotonin is happiness.
[S12] No, serotonin also does sleep.
[S11] Well, it’s more dopamine though /you take dopamine to sleep
[S10] Well it’s both /it’s both of them /I mean it’s /it’s
[S11] But, that’s anything, I mean alcohol changes your brain chemistry /so does nicotine and tar that are in cigarettes
[S12] Well,
[Give us some biological facts.]
[Laughter]
[S12] Um, in terms of what it actually does /I’m gonna sound like a raving dork, but um it’s suppresses the body’s  T cyto-toxic cells which are /yeah, I know
[S11] What does it mean, what does it mean?
[S12] Those cells work against like mutagenic cells within the body itself as opposed to like outside agents or other antigens you might be exposed to, but like if something were to go wrong within yourself like cancer or so /uh /without those cells, you might be less able to /uh
[S10] Does alcohol do that?
[S12] I don’t know. But, just /by the way /um /that /uh /I think it’s TCH9 in marijuana binds to receptors in the brain /that is part of what does that
[S11] But, like I said, it’s everything in moderation. So, anything when you overdo it is bad. Um, I don’t think anyone should be drinking every day, I don’t think anyone should be /and when I say drinking, I mean drinking to the point where it’s gonna alter your chemistry, and that way I don’t think you should be smoking pot every day /but, if it’s in moderation, there’s no way it should not be legal
[S10] Hmm, but if it’s legal then more people
[S11] It’s arbitrary though /I don’t think so
[S10] You think that less people would?
[S11] I don’t think that less people would. I don’t really think that it’s going to change. I don’t think 
[S10] Then why make it legal?
[S9] Wait, but didn’t you say though if they make it legal that less people would use it?
[S10] I think it would change the demographics of who’s doing it /uh / I think people our age who’ve already been exposed to it for a longer period of time /but you have a whole generation of kids /like for example, my little brother is in 9th grade, if it becomes legal in the next three to four year, by the time he gets to college and it’s legal /could you imagine what /I mean I personally think if pot were legal on this campus it would be different /we’d have kids here with endless amounts of money flow that just waste it on anything that you can imagine
[S11] And, that’s their choice.
[S10] Yeah, it’s true.
[S11] It’s all about choice, and I think that people should be able to make the choice if they want to smoke pot or if they want to do alcohol or whatever.
[S10] But, I mean they can do it without it being legal.
[S11] Personally, if something’s illegal, I’m really not gonna do it. That’s why I don’t drink in the states. It’s illegal, and I know I’m the minority when it comes to that /I’m the minority /yeah /but, that is a deterrent to people /it’s a big deterrent
[S10] Yeah, I know. I mean sure, being underage is a deterrent.
[S12] Um, just to be really general /um /when you say um, it’s a personal choice /um /at the same time, you have to consider at what point it becomes disrespectful /like to you or 
[S9] Like at what point does it affect others?
[S12] Yeah, like going to class stoned /if you were to do that like
[S11] People go to class drunk all the time.
[S12] Right, or drunk /in either case, it’s just in general /but, in terms of having guidelines /um /like as opposed to personal choice /um /would /those guidelines would at least seem necessary /I’m not sure if it’s an argument for or against /I guess it would be for
[S11] Absolutely, guidelines are necessary /I’m not saying they’re not /I’m not saying it should be completely arbitrary to how much you wanna smoke, where you wanna smoke, I think there should be guidelines just like anything else
[S10] This whole drunk in class thing all the time /I don’t
[S11] I see kids drunk in class all the time /I have 8 a.m. classes everyday
[S10] Alright, so those are like the kids that show up with like the bottle of water, and they look hung over
[S11] They are still people who are still drunk from the night before.
[S10] They’re not functionally drunk, they’re not like belligerent in class.
[S11] I’m not saying people should go stoned to class ever. I don’t think it’s acceptable.
[S10] I’m just saying /I don’t think /I think if you were to like cut each class down, you would find a greater amount of kids /they’re probably the ones that are contributing the most because they’re inhibitions are cut down by pot and you come to 
[S11] They’re inhibitions are cut down by alcohol too.
[S10] Yeah, but you just sit there quietly because you probably feel miserable because it’s 8 a.m. in the morning and you probably feel hung-over.
[S11] I don’t know, it’s /it’s like I said /it affects people differently, and just like anything /so 
[S10] I mean I have multiple classes where there’s like two kids that talk each class and they wait till everybody doesn’t raise their hand cause
[S11] I’m that kid.
[S10] Me too
[S11] So /but that doesn’t
[S10] If I’m stoned in class then there’s /I mean just because I am somebody that does talk /it’s different but I don’t feel as bashful /so 
[S11] If it’s gonna be legal, people aren’t going to /like people still have a sense of decorum /they’re not gonna go /it’s the same thing /alcohol’s legal so most people won’t go drunk to class /most people aren’t gonna go stoned to class /they’re
[S10] No
[S11] So, I don’t think that really makes any sense as an argument.
[S10] I think it makes it legally /I don’t think it makes a difference, legal or illegal /people are probably gonna go sober to class, right?
[S11] Right, but I still think it should be legal because it /there’s no reason for it not to be /I don’t feel that there really is a reason not to be
[S10] Well, I think they should make it legal for a year then and you could see the greater population burnout and you’ll see why
[S11] I don’t think that’ll happen with the greater population /people 
[S10] People have become burnouts and it’s ugly.
[S11] People have more restraint than that. People as a whole 
[S10] Cause it’s addicting. Pot’s addicting.
[S12] I don’t think you could legalize it for a year and then
[S10] No, I’m saying they should /I mean they could do an experiment /it’d be funny to see cause
[S11] But, pot’s not as addictive as alcohol is /because people get addicted to drinking alcohol
[S10] It’s totally different, it’s totally different.
[S11] No, it’s not different.
[Ok, you guys are gonna continue this afterwards.]
