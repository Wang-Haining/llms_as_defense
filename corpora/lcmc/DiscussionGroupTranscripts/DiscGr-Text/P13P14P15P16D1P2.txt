PRIVACY RIGHTS
[Is everyone ready to begin again? Ok. Recently school officials prevented a school shooting because one of the shooters posted a MySpace bulletin. Do you think this was an invasion of privacy? Does anybody want to begin?]

[S16] What / What did he post?

[Um / a bulletin about / possible school shooting]

[S16] Oh.

[S15] I don’t really think it’s that /really invasive /cause / to me MySpace is / the tell all / be-all type of website / you put it up there cause you know other people are gonna see it / so I think it’s almost like / I’m crying for help being like this is what I’m gonna do / someone should try to stop me / and / I don’t know / I don’t really have high opinions of MySpace / so 

[S14] I’m not quite sure about the logistics of MySpace. Is it / like Facebook?

[S16] It’s like Facebook.

[S15] I think it is.  You have to request like someone

[S16} Yea

[S15] I don’t have it but I think that’s what it’s like.

[S13] I don’t have I either.

[S14] Like when you post something / like / can anybody just read it / or like

[S16] I think you can look at anyone’s / unless there’s like some kind of option / but / I’ve seen / like / my friends who I wasn’t friends with on MySpace yet / like I’ve seen their profiles / but / um / if it’s like / if they’re using it / if the school’s using it for that / to possibly save lives / that / I don’t know / I don’t think you could really say anything about that / like / it could have been much worse that just invading someone’s privacy

[S13] I think if you post anything on the internet / the whole point of the internet is that it’s world wide / like / you can spread information and if you put something on there you have to know that people are going to be reading it / and / 

[S14] Yea / what are even discussing right now is privacy / and the whole point of MySpace is that it’s not private / you post is so that people read it 
[Laughter]
[S14] I mean / the internet is a really debatable issue / I mean the government has been really on the edge between like / invading privacy and what not / and certain things like instant messaging like when you’re having a private conversation / I mean / that’s closer to being an invasion of privacy than my space is 

[S15] Yea / I agree with that a lot.

[S13] I mean even if you were to say that they somehow like / let’s say you had to be / friends with somebody on MySpace in order to see it and then / ya know / the school official like used somebody else / like got to it by some weird way / I think even the fact that they saved people’s lives / like / that’s more important than the fact that this kid’s privacy was invaded and somebody read his MySpace

[S14] We’re just / ya know / examining the difference in like privacy and safety / I mean / it’s a really thin line / between them / like / um / uh / I think it was Benjamin Franklin / who said / those who give up their essential liberties in order to [inaudible] uh / safety / deserve neither liberty nor safety / and / um / I don’t know / that quite quote like really / I don’t know

[S13] Can you say that again? I didn’t catch that.

[S14] those who give up their essential liberties in order to purchase some temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety

[S13] oh

[S14] so / I mean / there’s this whole/ I mean like the Patriot Act / where / um / I mean it helped prevent terrorism / but it also did a lot of bad things too / and / ya know / whether it should be legal or not is a huge problem right now 

[S16] Um / yea/ with like putting stuff on the internet though / um / no one’s / no one’s like / it’s not like there’s someone forcing you to / like / put something about yourself on their / or like say what you’re gonna do / so / if you decide to put it up there / it should be just like open to anyone 

[S14] I mean / I know like / I think we’re pretty much like agree on the fact that

[S16] Yea

[S14] like the MySpace thing is not really an invasion of privacy / but / I mean / you talk about like internet conversations / and like / phone calls / being monitored / I mean / is this / this is / this is definitely an invasion of privacy and this shouldn’t be allowed just / ya know / to combat terrorism

[S13] Personally / I wouldn’t really have a problem with that because / I mean / I / if I’m like talking to my friends on the computer or even on the phone or something /  if some government official who doesn’t know me is listening to that / I mean / I would rather them be able to possibly like be able to catch a terrorist than have them listen to me talk about what I’m gonna wear or something stupid like that / like / I would hope they wouldn’t really be spending their time listening to conversations like that
[S14] I mean / that’s exactly the point / they’re not going to monitor your conversations / because / you’re a white, female, college student / they don’t give a crap at all about you / um / I mean / this is going to be like racially profiling / this is gonna be like / ya know / ya know / Arab people, black people probably / I mean / is that fair? Is that right?

[S16] Yea / It’s not fair to them / if they’re / if someone’s a / like an Arab-US citizen and they just decide to monitor them just like based on that / it’s not / that’s completely taking away their freedom / cause they / they’re not / they can’t all be terrorists
[Laughter]
[S16] even if you do like / catch a few / you’re still like / you could still be ruining lives of people who get falsely like inspected and interrogated and stuff just cause their race

[S15] It’s kinda like the / modern way of doing like camps during like World War 2 / putting all the Chinese people or Japanese people into like those camps out west / instead of just putting them in all one location you let them be where they are but you still monitor them / so it’s / I agree / it’s like racial profiling / it’s an invasion of privacy / um / I don’t know / like / sure/ there’s like safety precautions and like terrorists that we should try and stop / but / that’s not like the only ethnic group that is a terrorist [inaudible] / some people are blinded to that

[S14] you also have to ask / ya know / how many terrorists are actually caught? Ya know / because of ya know / let’s say the Patriot Act / I mean / you’d definitely hear about it if it happened / the media would definitely like / hype up / this up / because it shows that the Patriot Act is working / but / I have not / ya know / I watch the news pretty regularly and do not see much of this at all / I’ve seen more instances of people taking of it because of the Patriot Act / so 

[S13] Also going back to the MySpace thing / um / like / I don’t exactly where I’m going with this
[Laughter]
[S13] but / ya know how / um / they always have people saying how / like / oh well this child was murdered because he met someone on MySpace / and blah blah blah / I don’t really think it’s an invasion of / well I guess we already established that / invasion of privacy like that whole thing / because it is public / and / it’s kind of like when you see police officers listening in / or like IMing people / like we were talking about / is IM / like a closed conversation between two people / well yes it is / but also like / what happens if / the / I don’t know where I’m going with this.
[Laughter]
[S13] I don’t know / ya know how they like catch people / like / being like weird or something / I guess in that case

[S16] You could just copy / like a conversation / and like post it somewhere if you wanted

[S13] Yea / I don’t know where I’m going with that / you can just 

[S14] I don’t know / like certain things where they use the internet to catch people / they’ll like make up a fake name / and then talk to someone / I don’t have a problem with that at all

[S13] Yea / right.

[S14] It’s their fault for talking to some random stranger / ya know / getting caught because of it / but if two people are having a closed conversation

[S13] Yea / and someone else is listening in

[S14] how should that be any different from a telephone conversation or just a conversation like we’re having right now

[S15] Like you would think they should get some type of like / warrant / if they want to do that / so that at least some other party knows what’s going on / and like 

[S14] Thanks to the Patriot act they don’t need one.

[S15] I know.

[So where do you think we should draw the line / as to whether you’re invading privacy or not? With the school officials or otherwise]

[S16] um / I think if you / like if the school wanted to use Facebook against us or something / it’s like a / like everybody in the school has Facebook basically / um / they / they should be able to / but / for the right reasons I think / um / I don’t know / it’s kinda hard to like distinguish I guess / like / you can’t really do that in reality / cause like / they could just go on / but / um / since that’s the case and like you can’t really distinguish / I would say that / it’s not really / um / it’s not really fair to people / to use / stuff that they say on the internet / completely against them / like if you / if you have a picture of yourself drinking or something on Facebook / and they / and they just look that up and arrest you or whatever
[Laughter]
[S16] I don’t know / that / that’s not really fair / cause those are / um / I don’t know / that’s kinda like prying into / like someone’s personal life I guess

[S15] But also / Facebook’s a bit different than MySpace cause it’s got all these privacy like /

[S16] Yea

[S15] keys and things / actions you can incorporate / and turn on / so that’s more of like / I guess you creating your own person webpage / and only allowing some people to see it / I guess kinda like only giving out your cell phone number to certain people / where as like / MySpace doesn’t really have that / from what I hear

[S16] Yea / I don’t think so.

[S15] So / I think / there are certain things you can draw the line at / like / I would draw the line at Facebook / cause like / it’s as inclusive as you make it to be / whereas like MySpace / not so much 

[S14] I guess / I didn’t know / are there like privacy features that you can have like / just / your friends see you / cause / I knew there was like the thing / where like / anyone who went to the same school as you could see you

[S13] I think that’s like the default / but then you can go in

[S16] Yea / you can change

[S15] each individual thing that you have up there / like / your / ya know / all your contact information / or / pictures / blah blah blah / anything that’s up there you can put / like / different limits as to who can see that / I think you can even go so far as to like specify people’s name
[S13] Yea
[S15] like specific people’s names that can’t see it

[S13] yea / you can really specify it / so

[S16] I don’t know if MySpace has that / like / I just don’t know / I mean / I’ve never really / I don’t even have a MySpace account

[S15] I don’t think you can [inaudible] / From what I’ve heard though it doesn’t

[S16] Yea / me too.

[S14] Instead of getting / I mean / there’s also / like / question if like you actually like / put up a picture of you like breaking a law / it’s like / if you put up like a picture of you smoking from a bong or something / like / that’s just a fault of your own self not having any discretion / like 

[S13] So then do you think they should be able to get in trouble because of that?

[S14] Not necessarily. I just think that you shouldn’t be stupid [laughter]

[S16] You can’t even really prove that like / what if it was just like / tobacco or something / and what if you have like a beer can full of water / like you can’t really / it’s not realistic
[S15] Yea
[S16] Like you can’t really prove that 

[S14] But I mean / if you’re not the government / let’s say you’re a company 
[S16] Well yea / like a school is private
[S14] hiring someone / they don’t care if it’s [inaudible]
[S16] Oh yea / definitely. 

[S14] Something else about / you mentioned / uh / like cell phones / like only giving out your number to certain people / as of the recently / uh / all cell phone numbers were released to like / the / phone / um / I don’t know what they call them / the phone spammers

[S15] Telemarketers

[S14] Telemarketers / yea

[S15] There’s a number though you call 
[laughter]
[S15] and you have your phone number taken off / so

[S14] but I mean / should you have to do that 

[S15] yea / I don’t know / I don’t think you should have to / but you do

[S14] I mean / I still feel like that’s an invasion of privacy / even there / [inaudible] the line should be drawn

[S15] Yea

[Anymore thoughts about where the line should be drawn as to whether or not they’re invading privacy / in schools / or ]

[S14] I mean / I don’t think you can really / can / draw a line / I mean / even if you could pinpoint the exact point where like / I don’t know / it’s fair to / like invade people’s privacy or whatever / I mean / there are still gonna be exceptions / like / I mean / there are gonna be people upset wherever you put / the line / I mean / there’s always going to be this gray area / you can’t really do anything about

[S16] Unless there’s some kind of vote on it / that would be the only possible like / fair way I could think of / making any line / like if / if it’s just a few people sitting around / like / I don’t know / it would be / it would be pretty fair if they gave enough choices / in some kind of vote or something 

[S14] But who would be voting?

[S16] like if they did it at the school / if they made / if they had the students / like / um / if they asked us if we / they should be allowed to use Facebook against us / or shouldn’t they / I don’t know what students would say like yes use it against me 

[S13] Yea

[S16] I don’t know

[S14] You have to ask like who should have a say / I mean / should the administration have a say? I mean that’s gray area too.

[S16] Uh-huh

[S14] I’ll say / I think the line’s / being very poorly drawn by the current administration / I don’t think they want any lines / at all / so

[S13] Are you talking about the school or the country?

[S14] oh / the country / right now / I don’t have a problem with Loyola.

[Do you want to expand on that? On anyone else’s opinions on that]

[S14] um / just in everything / I mean / I keep bringing up the Patriot Act / I feel like this is a huge invasion of privacy / I mean / overseas even / there’s an invasion of privacy / is that / where the line / should there be a line drawn / like / across that / I don’t know.
[Laughter]

[Anything? Alright do you guys have any other thought of this? Alright / end of discussion]
