GAY MARRIAGE
[Is everyone ready to begin? Ok. While some states have legalized gay marriage, others are opposed to it. Do you think either side is right or wrong and why? Who would like to begin?]
[S20] I’ll go /um /I’m number twenty. /alright well /uh /the way I’ve always viewed it /if you actually look at the definition of marriage /it’s the union between a man and a woman, and I’m not opposed to gay people being together or anything /but um /I just don’t think it should be called a marriage exactly /I think it should be a legal union or something of the sort /um /so like /that way it obviously wouldn’t be /um /wouldn’t be like referred to as a marriage within the church or anything /uh /which is /that’s the way marriages start out /then they become legalized like when the judges started doing it /and um /what do you guys think about that? I think it should be more of like a definition type thing.
[S18] Hi, I’m number eighteen.
[Laughter]
[You don’t have to say it every time you talk.]
[Laughter]
[S18] Yeah /um /I really don’t know cause I’m a catholic too and of course with marriage being between a man and a women /it kinda gets a little sticky when you’re talking about the church as opposed to the government /but um /yeah /I don’t really know what/the terminology could be changed maybe to make everyone happy/but then again it wouldn’t make everyone happy if we’re throwing around vocabulary and like history of a word /but um /the concept I’m not against /definitely not.
[S17] Yeah /I mean I didn’t even look at the terminology /I don’t think it really matters /I think that more to appease people /but whether you call it a marriage or you call it a legal union, it’s still the same thing. So I support it completely.
[S19] I agree /it’s kind of a /cause I’m not catholic but I grew up going to church and so it’s against my religion, but on the other side I have a lot of gay friends and like it’s seemingly unfair because it’s like hindering their lifestyle also so.
[S20] Do you think it would hinder their lifestyle if it was not called a marriage?
[S19] No /but then I think they would still not be happy with that.
[S20] Why wouldn’t they be happy?
[S18] Cause I think that they have certain ideals that they’re pushing for
[S19] Yeah /and like I feel that if it was called a union instead of a marriage and it was like distinctly /like there was a distinction between the two /like they would feel like they aren’t getting the better treatment still because they aren’t
[S18] I always thought something funny was /um /people look at marriage as a religious definition but it’s kinda funny if you think about it/the government doesn’t give like tax breaks or anything to people who are baptized. You don’t get baptized in the face of like the U.S. government so maybe like /if you wanted to go like to the wall with the separation of church and state you could just call it all legal unions and then /I don’t know/but that’s maybe goin a little too far
[S17] Well marriage doesn’t have to be religious /people get married in like courts and stuff
[S18] No /that’s what I mean so if you just take that legal definition and kinda take away the marriage /hot word marriage and put /so the government just views it all as legal /cause you /everyone
[S17] I don’t think a government would really have any excuse not to /ya know /unless they’re
[S18] Mmm. 
[S17] Basing their government on religion
[S18] Yeah /cause their still
[S17] Yeah /which they shouldn’t be doing.
[Laughter]
[S19] With the separation of the church and the state /I think that /because /like /like /if a gay person is gonna get married they’re probably not gonna get married in the church because there aren’t many churches that would marry like a gay couple anyways /so I think that in that way the separation between a marriage and a union would work because the union could be associated with /uh / like getting married in /um /like a court or something like that /whereas a marriage would be in a church.
[S18] Yeah /so you’re saying like the two different definitions of marriage /like using the same word for two different things?
[S19] Yeah.
[Do you have any more thoughts about that?]
[S20] Um /can you clarify
[S19] What I mean?
[S20] Yeah /go into a little more detail
[S19] Well /a union would refer to like being joined as a couple in like a courthouse whereas as marriage would refer to being joined as a couple in a church.
[S20] Alright /yeah that’s what I was trying to get at/just making sure /at the same level there
[S17] So would you be considered married /if you by today’s standard got married in a court /you wouldn’t be married then?
[S18] You could call it whatever you want.
[S19] Yeah. You would be like the same thing /just a different name/so yes
[S17] Why would you name it differently then?
[S19] Because the whole /I don’t know
[Laughter]
[S20] What ya could do /ya know /is for the people who ya know wanna be involved with the church you can be married within the church /but also be married /make it legal as well
[S17] So the church wouldn’t accept gay marriage?
[S20] Well it doesn’t.
[S19] It doesn’t accept gay marriage.
[Laughter]
[S20] Ya know /so like there’s no change in that.
[S18] Not in the near future /that’s for sure /that’s for damn sure.
[You wanna speak a little bit more about that?]
[S18] Oh it’s not gonna /I mean I like catholic but I have no doubt that like gay marriage is like not even gonna be considered an issue in the catholic church /it’s just not gonna happen for a while /well yeah /who knows for a while /but I/ yeah /growin up catholic and knowin how it works /I definitely don’t think
[S20] Especially Benny D.
[S18] What?
[S20] Benedict as our Pope right now.
[S17] Do you think that it’s against Christianity or Catholicism like you personally?
[S20] It’s definitely against Catholicism
[S17] Cause I know other churches accept it/like I’m Episcopalian and I’ve seen like gay / um marriages.
[S20] In the Catholic Church?
[Laughter]
[S17] No /um /cause they obviously interpret the Bible to accept it /so do you think any Catholics do? Or do you as a catholic?
[S19] I’m not a catholic /well I’m Protestant /four square /and my church is like adamantly
[S17] against it
[S19] Well like /they don’t dislike gay people but like they’re against gay marriage /oh yeah /die-hard like Republican at my church
[Laughter]
[S17] Have you come into contact with Catholics that think that it’s acceptable?
[S18] I don’t have a problem with it, but then again I’m not gay. So I don’t know how like/I don’t know /it’s never /it’s not like a burning rage of like desire of mine to like go like 
[S20] Gung-ho or something?
[S18] Yeah /like go to the Catholic Church and appeal
[S20] Cause it’s not really involved in your life
[S18] Well yeah /I mean like I know gay people /but I mean /gay boys and girls
[S20] Are they catholic?
[S18] Um no
[Laughter]
[S18] Actually they’re atheist so I guess they’re kinda removed completely from the religious debate whatsoever
[S20] Well I know two gay catholic people/I’ve never talked to them about it though so it’s not gonna help.
[S17] Um /do you think like if something started /it would gain support in the Catholic Church? /like among/not among like Priests and stuff but it seems like among a lot of practice-ers
[S18] Practicing Catholics?
[S17] Practicing Catholics/that do think that it’s ok
[S18] For all the /all the /[laughter] / I hate to sound like / I don’t know judgmental but like for every one person that hops board that kinda movement/there’s gonna be like five dudes in like the deep south yellin from their porches that ain’t right
[Laughter]
Ya know it’s just so embedded in the culture /I mean it’s /you’re gonna have to wean it out after many generations after something like that gets introduced into the catholic church
[S20] I think there’s always gonna be like a little portion /a little portion of the Catholic Church /the followers that is /never the leaders /but that would definitely think it would be alright but it would always be the majority that would most likely be against it I feel.
[S17] We grew up in an area where the followers would probably support it more.
[S19] Yeah, I grew up in the south /I grew up Baptist and like I feel like /exactly /it would a lot different like
[Do you want to talk a little bit more about that?]
[S19] Well
[Laughter]
[S18] Yes, tell us about the Baptist faith.
[Just explain a little bit more. You were saying the difference between living here and living maybe in the south.
[S19] It’s not as liberal /like /I’m from /like I lived in Alabama till I was twelve and then from then till I came to here I lived in New Hampshire /and New Hampshire is a lot more liberal /than it was in the south 
[Laughter]
[S20] You went from the extreme to the extreme
[S19] Yeah exactly /like /all the kids I went to high school with were like hippy
[S18] Pot-smokin tree huggers!
[S19] Exactly/exactly and when/in like the south /like completely different /I don’t think even most of the people I grew up with in the south even like drank that much in high school so /and like my sister who she grew up more in the south cause she’s almost four years older than me as opposed to me cause I spent most of my older years in the north /like /just her perception on like drinking and drugs and stuff like that /completely different than mine /just cause like all my friends were like oh whatever it’s fine. But her friends were like adamantly against it when she was growing up so 
[S20] Where exactly is everybody from? I’m not sure if you guys had said that or not. You’re from Alabama originally. I’m from Maryland
[S18] I’m from Connecticut.
[S17] I’m from New Jersey.
[S20] Alright so we got/we got the full spectrum here.
[Laughter]
[S19] Down the coast
[S18] The whole spectrum of Loyola at least.
[Laughter]
[S19] So/like where some people are gonna be open-minded/you’re gonna have your conservatives completely against it /so
[S20] It’s all political to me /I mean jeez everything’s freakin political nowadays /like as sad as that is /but that’s really what it comes down to / is politics /Does anybody want to add on to that? Because I think that would make a terrific thing to add on to.
[S18] I don’t know. I don’t think everything is politics. I disagree on that.
[S20] I have nothing to back that up.
[S17] I don’t think everything is /cause I think like people feel associated with a certain political party and they feel like they have to stay in line with those views /even if /if it were an isolated issue/they may feel otherwise /like especially with religion /they feel like they have to stick with what they were living and support it even if you just presented it separately they might not say the same thing.
[S20] Cause like I feel like there’s those people such as myself /um /I am a Republican /but I sure as heck don’t follow everything Republicans follow /ya know /like /ya know /generally a lot of youth nowadays joins a party just because their parents are in that party. Like for instance my mom’s only republican because she’s against abortion /stuff like that /uh /that’s a huge contributor to why I am a republican/cause ya know I’m against abortion /But ya know that’d be like that isolated thing where like ya know you follow that stuff
[S17] There’s so much controversial stuff goin on that people feel like they have to pick and party and they can’t /ya know /feel liberal about some things
[S18] It’s kinda funny cause I don’t consider myself I don’t really bother with parties /like I’m just moderate /like I worked for a congresswoman and I still don’t consider myself a Republican. Actually, I’m glad she lost.
[Laughter]
Like yeah I don’t know /and workin on, workin on working on that was a big thing for me cause it’s just like damn politics suck.
[Laughter]
Like it’s just a shame how like /I don’t know /it’s like growing up high school politics like to the nth degree /I mean it’s pathetic / I mean yeah the way some things in politics are run /it’s just getting that inside look/feel like writing like a muckraker novel about like how awful the inside of politics is
[Well how do you guys feel about President Bush’s push for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and do you think that the federal government should be involved in this issue?]
[S18] Nice /uh /transition there /tryin to /uh /keep us in the fences
[Laughter]
[S19] I don’t think it should be a federal issue. I think it should be up to the individual states cause not every state is Republican and not every state is Democrat so
[S18] Well I don’t know /I wouldn’t call states part of a party as a whole /but I know you mean red and blue states /but I mean I don’t know
[S20] You also got the border states. Maryland is a border state.
[S18] Yeah /but the constitutional amendment /that’s just like /it’s just not logical /I mean
[S17] That’s what cuts it off from everybody whereas if you have it states /at least some states will
[S18] Yeah /I mean like if you let the states make their own laws and eventually all the states agree like why not/why not make it a federal law /but right now the way it is /I mean /like /let them talk amongst themselves for a couple years.
[S20] But then like if you think about it /then like goin back to the civil war ya know when you had the confederacy /it’ll just be like those southern states will just have one general view whereas the northern states will have another view
[laughter]
[S17] Civil war?
[S20] We’ll just go after everybody and like it’ll just be hell in a hand basket.
[laughter]
[S18} What, what, what do you think is gonna provoke all this? Just letting the states duke it out or like?
[S20] I don’t even think it should be a state issue /I think like you said it should be an individual issue /um /well I think it should be an individual issue /like I don’t think government should be tied in at all
[S18] So you would legalize it for everyone?
[S17] There’d have to be like /they’d have to either allow it or disallow it so like who makes that decision?
[S18] Yeah, even if they don’t do anything about it then they’re allowing it.
[laughter]
[S17] Right.
[S18] So you’re saying actually you’re for the legalization of gay marriage, technically? From what you just said.
[S17] Yeah /well that’s what you said before.
[S20] Yeah, ya know it’s /I, I, don’t want it to be called a marriage because that’s a union of a union between a man and a women /well in the dictionary too /like legally if you wanna say that /that’s right now as a fact that’s what marriage is /like that’s what it says by fact /but ya know I don’t know /I just feel as though it should be called something else /feel very strongly about that.
[S18] Playin off you and getting back to the constitutional part /I think it’d be much easier to change a word in the dictionary then it’d be to change the constitution. Especially with good old Bush.
[S19] That’s true. I feel like though if it was made a constitutional law that there was no gay marriage /I feel like that would cause more controversy and more like disruption.
[S17] Oh yeah.
[S19] Than individual states deciding whether or not they’re gonna legalize it. Then you’re gonna have bombs in the streets.
[S18] Well the states are deciding it now and it’s not like you have bombs in the streets now.
[laughter]
Well I mean if like Bush like locks himself away in like watching the [inaudible] and like writes an amendment /down on an 8 by 11 paper
[S20] Sends it out by dove.
[S18] Through the window
[laughter]
What imaging is that?
[S19] I feel like that’s gonna cause more rise /that’ll cause rise in the streets /if Bush is like no gay marriage for anyone
[S17] Yeah /cause people have feelings about him already
[S18] Yeah I was gonna say /you’re just waiting for like that fuse to be lit
[laughter]
[S20] It’s just fun to make fun of the guy.
[S19] He makes bad decisions. We all do.
[S20] Go back to the topic though. Does anybody have any feelings about anything else? I feel like everything was kinda already thrown out there. And like gay marriage leads to abortion, leads to?
[S18] Keep goin? Keep goin, ok.
[S20] Alright, that’s cool.
[S17] Um/so
[S18] Yeah. We’ve defined marriage. Let’s define what it is to be gay.
[S17] Oh I have a good idea /what we could talk about /like how do you think it affects their kids or if they want to have kids? /things like that
[S18] Ooo /ok
[S20] Or Richard something from Survivor One /the guy who walked around nude /yeah he has a son /I don’t know /maybe we can talk about the gay people that we do know and maybe their feelings on this /how about that?
[S19] Um /they obviously feel that gay marriage should be legalized.
[laughter]
[S20] Well obviously /yeah
[S18] I don’t know/the gay people I know are way to extreme /it’s just like F Bush /I don’t care /like end of discussion
[S20] Yeah /very close-minded on the Bush issue and you can’t blame them.
[S17] Well /I don’t know /to them it’s just like not a big deal [inaudible]
[S20] So you said, your gay friends were atheist?
[S18] Yeah one of them /yeah
[S20] You said you have a lot of gay friends?
[S19]  I don’t have a lot /I have a couple
[S20] Are they religious at all or?
[S19] No.
[S20] Do you know anything about yours?
[S17] No /like I can’t associate anyone with a certain religion.
[S20] Alright /well I know /this is kinda like ironic I guess you could say since we’re talking about this /I know two gay guys /both of them were involved in church and both have played Jesus in the stations of the cross
[laughter]
[S19] Does the church know they’re gay?
[S20] Um /I believe the youth minister probably does /and you know he’s a cool guy /he’s chill and all ya know /he’s modern /ya know /I said ya know like five billion times right there
[laughter]
Um /he /our youth minister ya /gee I keep sayin it
[laughter]
Oh man, it’s a habit /he is very /he’s like 24ish /um /so he’s very in with the modern ways I guess you could say but on the other hand ya know he still has faith in his religion and everything /so I think the new generation has just as much faith /just their more lenient on different things /so we were saying how the um church could change their views in the future /I do think it’s possible like you said /but then on the other hand /agreeing with number eighteen because I forgot your name /um that it will take a long, long time for it to get there
[S19] Yeah /it’s funny cause like /the people in my youth group /like people my age
[S20] In Alabama?
[S19] No. New Hampshire /are like against abortion /against anything like that /ya know /so
[S18] Well let’s not throw all our eggs in one basket as far as the catholic church’s views on uh
[S19] Yeah /well it’s not even just the catholic church it’s like the
[S20] Christians in general /Not even just Christians
[S19] Yeah /but then like I’m friends with them /and I don’t /I’m not like /I don’t feel
[Laughter]
Strongly /like either way /so
[S18] He’s a nice guy, but he’s against abortion.
[Laughter]
[S20] But /um /let’s see /if it was legalized /ya know /arrgh there it goes again /but um you were saying how /ya know /[laughter] /you have friends /oh my God almighty /alright so you have uh /you have /you can basically ya know /Oh my God!
[S19] It’s ok. You can keep saying it.
[S20] It’s like saying like when you’re a 13 year old girl.
[laughter]
Alright /so you’re friends with people who are obviously against it /but you guys will definitely uh /I can ya know /uhh /so you guys will definitely still be friends even if it was legalized though and I think that if it was legalized everyone would eventually get along. There’d be a rough time there, but
[S19] Like that have gay friends, but they wouldn’t support gay marriage /ya know /so
[S18] It’s not like /yeah it’s not like people are walkin down the street like havin it out
[S20] Westside Story /Sharks
[S19] Like they aren’t gonna go like burning crosses and like setting fire to people’s houses
[laughter] but 
[Ok. You guys have any other thoughts?]
[S18] Noo.
[Ok, end of interview.]
