PRIVACY RIGHTS
[Recently school officials prevented a school shooting because one of the shooters posted a Myspace bulletin. Do you think that this was an invasion of privacy?]
[S18] Nope.
[S20] No. That kid was stupid.
[Laughter]
[S19] Why would you post that on Myspace? Everybody reads Myspace. It’s to the /like that’s not privacy at all.
[S17] There’s no like real law against invasion of privacy either /like
[S18] Anything you put on the internet is public demand.
[S17] And if they have a reason to inspect which they obviously did /it’s gonna save people and like
[S19] Like /when you post something on Myspace /it’s like posted so all your friends can read it to /and obviously if somebody sees that and they’re like I go to that school /I don’t want to die /like
[S20] Well that’s my first reaction /shit
[S18] I mean yeah /I think all schools should do that /sure /[inaudible] /I mean I have a Myspace, I have a Facebook /I don’t put personal information /I don’t put anything like my own parents to see /like I make it so like I could show like my grandfather or my grandmother my Facebook or my Myspace and they’d be like oh that’s cool, dear /I mean you gotta have like /with every /with new technology /you have to keep your head and you have to keep self-control /most of those kids shouldn’t even have Myspace’s anyways cause you have to be at least 13
[S17] But, come one.
[S18] I know, but come on. I mean, my little cousin is like 8 and he has one /I mean that’s like
[S19] Like if a creepy pedophile could get on your Myspace 
[S18] Exactly.
[S19] Find out information about you and meet up with you somewhere /and that’s not considered an invasion of privacy /then a teacher looking at one shouldn’t be an invasion /I don’t even think your parents looking at your Myspace is an invasion of privacy because if you’re gonna put it up where anybody could see it /then you deserve to get caught
[S18] They have every right to /and like who’s seen that show on T.V. /it used to be called perverted justice and now I think they renamed it to how to catch a predator /that is /that is my favorite show /every time it’s on /cause it’s only on once in a while
[S20] Isn’t that [inaudible]
[S18] Yeah, Greg Hanson /yup he’s like excuse me, how are you doing today, sir? /have you seen our show? /I mean every time that’s on /me and my roommates like make popcorn and we gather around the television cause this is like such a great, great idea /I mean it’s so easy and it’s just like /it’s like fishing with dynamite /I mean just checking these /just checking these Myspace bulletins / I mean / I mean /uh /you can see this example /this kid said like oh I’m gonna shoot my school up Thursday and then watch South Park /I mean it’s like on a whim /and if you go and see the pedophiles /it’ll be like hey sexy, I’ll talk to you later /and it’s like a 35 year old bald dude talking to like a 12 year old girl /I mean it’s so obvious /yeah I mean like it’s what happens
[S20] That’s gross.
[S18] Yeah, it’s like I said /fishing with dynamite /it’s so easy to catch em and it would be a sin for them not to like go on and check 
[S17] Yeah
[S20] But, now /on the other hand /uh / the school officials going and viewing a person’s Myspace or whatever /they obviously uh save lives /prevented the shooting /do you guys think that they should be able to punish the kids for like seeing them drinking or whatever? /Like with pictures
[S17] No.
[S18] Well, I 
[S20] Cause I think those are two totally different things, but on the other hand, if they see that
[S18] There’s a difference because if some kid’s goin out and getting plastered on the weekends like what does he do in school? /does it have anything to do with what he does in school? /No /fine
[S20] Well, cause a lot of uh /for instance in my school there was a picture taken with a kid /um /actually that’s a totally different thing because he went to like Chili’s and he saw a teacher at the bar and he had a picture with a beer /and then like it was a huge controversy or whatever /but since the teacher’s in the picture I guess that’s different
[Laughter]
But /uh
[S18] He was drinking with the teacher?
[S20] No, he wasn’t even drinking.
[S17] Just the teacher was drinking.
[S20] Yeah, just the teacher was drinking /the teacher had
[S17] He just took a picture with the teacher and his beer.
[S19] Oh, that’s stupid.
[S20] Yeah, exactly /that’s stupid /some schools would find that 
[S19] Like it’s one thing if the school wants to like attack the parents and tell them that there’s child doing this /that’s one thing /but they shouldn’t get in trouble with the school /if it’s not the school
[S20] I don’t even think they should tell the parents.
[S18 My Dad would like get a kick out of that /he’d be like oh you’re a high school boy /you’re gonna find that funny /I mean that has nothing to do with like school shootings or 
[S19] It’s not like they got arrested.
[S17] I think the difference is /like whether it effects other people or not /threatening to kill someone is safety /what you do on your own is what you do on your own
[S19]  But then again, Loyola /if you get at trouble at home and Loyola finds out /you still get in trouble at school
[S20] What?
[S17] What do you mean?
[S19] Like if you /like if something happens at home on Christmas break /like get in trouble for drinking or something /um /if the school finds out you can still get in trouble
[S20] This school’s ridiculous.
[S17] That’s kinda dumb.
[S18] Well, that’s a private school. Well, also like with the invasion of privacy thing /you have to like look at what invasion means /I mean they’re not going /they’re not going like out of their way to obtain information about these students’ private lives /all they need to do /go on Myspace, go to their site /oh profile set to private /oh let me see /uh / setup a Myspace account and befriend them /I mean nothing that’s going out of their way /this can be done in like five minutes.
[S20] I don’t know how Myspace works. 
[S18] It’s just like any like /you have a Facebook?
[S20] Yeah
[S18] It’s even quicker than that.
[S19] It’s easier than that.
[S18] Cause with Facebook /to be part of a college network, you have to have a legitimate college email /now I think they opened it to
[S19] But you still have to be friends with someone to even look at their profile /Myspace you don’t have to be friends with them
[S18] Well, no, no, no. You can send Myspace profiles to private. That’s what I did. So, like Joe Smo that surfs on the internet can’t like 
[S17] Can they see part of it though?
[S18] They see your age, location and picture /but I am 75 years old from Kalamazoo, Michigan or something like that /and my profile picture is like the promo shot from taxi driver with Robert DeNiro. I mean like
[Laughter]
[S17] Ok.
[S18] So yeah /that doesn’t really
[S20] I think a lot of the schools take it over the top for discipline, but on the other hand, to prevent a school shooting /that’s awesome
[S18] Yeah, I’d rather not /I’d rather give up some of my /who is that Hobbes? What philosopher is that? /no /it’s like give up your personal freedom /there’s uh nature is a state of war
[S17] That’s Hobbes.
[S18] That’s Hobbes, right? Yeah /and then you give up uh personally freedom for safety and security to the government. That’s what I feel like in this situation /I’ll give up some of my freedoms just so I can like feel that warm, bubbly feeling inside every time like Greg Hanson arrests some dude on television.
[S17] And if you’re like a law-abiding citizen /you’re not really giving up anything anyway.
[S18] Exactly, yeah.
[S17] If you don’t have anything to hide.
[S20] Very true. What else can we say about this subject?
[S17] This is kinda a little bit off topic, but /just concerning privacy /what do you guys think about employers looking at Facebook?
[S20] I think it’s stupid.
[S19] I think that’s /I don’t know /it’s kinda weird I think
[S18] It sucks for us, but it’s kinda good for them /kinda thing like
[S20] It really depends on how they believe that whatever they see on Facebook will reflect person’s work habits.
[S18] Which it does. I mean, what you see on Facebook
[S19] At Evergreen’s /I mean you don’t post pictures of yourself studying on Facebook /it’s only when you’re like out with your friends that everybody’s like oh let’s take pictures /grab my camera /ya know
[S18] Well, Lord forbid I drink in my life, but
[Laughter]
Even if I did /I wouldn’t make sure those were tagged of me on Facebook /to Facebook
[S17] I don’t think it’s like a very fair basis for them to like hire you or not hire you based on what they see on there.
[S19] Like your Facebook isn’t going to determine if you’re irresponsible /like if they hire you and then you prove yourself to be irresponsible /then that’s one thing
[S20] I think it should be like on a personal basis that you should judge that /like my Facebook /someone looks at it like this kid’s weird /they’re gonna say this kid/ I mean obviously he’s an ok kid but I wouldn’t ya know pick him out of a hundred people /just doesn’t show how good of a worker he is /I mean I’m not saying I’m amazing or anything, but I am a good worker /like and my Facebook totally doesn’t reflect that
[S18] Well it’s also like /like when you go to an interview /I mean
[S20] I’m in a cowboy hat in all my Facebook pictures.
[S18] Yeah, I mean like when you go to an interview and you dress up /exactly like the cowboy hat / the employers /the future employers won’t like come to your house on the weekend and like hang out with you as you like /I don’t know like kick it back with your friends /I mean my activities under Facebook I think are writing weird music, drinking large quantities of milk, and hunting the mice that live in our apartment with steak knives and frying pans
[Laughter]
I mean if
[S20] That’s awesome.
[S18] Yeah, I just took the three most like /I don’t know eccentric things about myself /I mean you can’t /you can’t base that /but then again /the people that like look at Facebook /the future employers /they also /I mean they’re not as stupid /they’re not dumb /they’ll take that into account /I mean if they /if they look at your uh Facebook pictures and you’re like holding up a huge like pot mug or like
[S19] Ripping a bong
[S18] Yeah, blowing coke off a toilet seat /that oughta be something like alright well this says something serious /but even if they catch you like with your drunk face or a beer in your hand /they’re gonna be like oh let’s take this into account /I mean this kid’s 19, 20 year old college kid /boy or girl /I mean it’s not that / it doesn’t deviate that far from the norm where 
[S17] That’s true /yeah /they have to compare it to other college kids /cause you know you cant compare it to the employer that you only see in the work place.
[Since you brought it up, do you want to elaborate a little bit more on what you think about it?]
[S17] Um /well I agree /I don’t think it’s a good way of determining whether you should hire somebody or not /um /cause it doesn’t really reflect how they would be in the workplace /it’s like their personality /it’s not like their characteristic
[S19] Facebook is like the fun, outgoing side of your personality. Because Facebook is a way to connect with other people your age /in your school /like it’s a way of communicating with your peers /it’s not like a resume
[S18] I use it for the hot chicks.
[Laughter]
[S17] It’s not to impress people.
[S20] Yeah, it’s definitely not.
[Laughter]
With my cowboy hat.
[S18] Yeah, exactly.
[S20] And my 80s multi-colored sports coat.
[So where do you think school officials should draw the line?]
[S18] They shouldn’t. I mean they shouldn’t /they shouldn’t go /like I said before /they shouldn’t go unreasonable lengths of like /they shouldn’t go above and beyond there /what’s like considered normal /and I guess what’s like considered normal is /I mean Myspace /checking Myspace /checking Facebook /definitely isn’t considered above and beyond
[S17] I think checking places /like checking public domains 
[S18] Yeah, public domains. Exactly.
[S17] If you’re like looking through someone’s voicemail, it’s a little different.
[S18] Yeah, it’s /exactly /like you don’t /you don’t like hire private detective to like see what the bad kids
[S17] It’s totally lawful /to look on someone’s Myspace so I think that’s fine
[S18] Well, but then again /but it is totally lawful to hire a private detective to go and look at someone. I mean you have to /you have to /what’s considered like extra effort to go above and beyond to make sure you’ve retrieved information about the student’s private life
[S20] I even think like goin on Myspace is goin above and beyond /like
[S18] You do think that’s goin above and beyond?
[S20] I don’t think it’s an invasion of privacy, but I totally think it’s an invasion 
[S17] Well, it does take effort, but not too much.
[S18] Well, I mean it does take effort to like use the bathroom.
[Laughter]
[S20] What?
[S18] I hate to be blunt. I mean like everything takes effort. I mean you have to draw a line somewhere /I mean 
[S19] How do you feel about like schools that search lockers and backpacks and stuff like that?
[S18] Well I got
[S20] My school totally did.
[S18] Yeah [laughter].
[S19] My school totally did too. They brought in like sniffing dogs and stuff like that.
[S18] Yeah, it’s the funniest thing in high school. I mean /just at simple, Catholic high school /they heard that like one kid had weird or that like some idiot brought in like a like ridiculous amount of weed and hid it in like their locker /I remember looking out the window in bio class /big like drug sniffing dog like jumps up past the window 
[Laughter]
I look around like did anyone just see that? I thought I was hallucinating.
[S17] We had like an undercover [inaudible] in our school.
[S18] Did you really?
[S17] She was like in one of my classes /she like /there was a bug drug bust
[S19] Yeah /at my school /like they
[S18] What drug was it? Do you mind me asking?
[S17] I don’t know /I don’t think /they weren’t very public about it
[S19] At my school /the Concord police were at my school like every week busting somebody for something and like they went on this huge like drug thing /this one kid bought a bag of weed from someone and got caught with it at school and so the school was like you won’t get in trouble if you like tell us who sold it to you
[S18] Yeah /they do that a lot
[S19] Yeah /and he ended up giving them a whole list of people involved
[S18] Yeah, well it’s private school.
[S19] Well, I went to a public school.
[S18] You went to a public school and they did that?
[S19] He ended up transferring because he made a lot of enemies /um /but he like gave a whole list of people who were 
[S20] Aw no way
[S19] Like people that he didn’t even have the right to write down / I mean yes they were probably all guilty of something /but like he wrote down a whole list /all those people got called to the office /all their lockers got searched /like anything they had on them
[S20] That’s ridiculous.
[S18] See, yeah, but that’s drugs. I mean I still wouldn’t consider /I mean would suck if it happened to me or my friends but like of course they wouldn’t find anything in my locker [laughter] /but um 
[S19] I mean I think it’s stupid to bring a [inaudible] anyways
[S18] Exactly /I mean it’s like
[S19] It’s not worth it
[S18] Yeah. I mean like when we’re parents /if we ever become parents I’m sure like people would want us to like /like we would want with that stuff happening to our kids /we wouldn’t want like kids selling drugs to our kids in school /I mean
[S19] I actually witnessed it at school /someone at their locker 
[Laughter]
[S18] Yeah /you’re not the only one /trust me on this
[S19] Ok /way to be discrete
[S18] Catholic high school kids are like awful /I mean I’ve seen kids  like walk by, open a locker, take out the blank page from the beginning of the end of the Bible, rip it out, and then go use it to smoke a J /it was the real deal which is just like 
[S17] Oh my God.
[S19] Pages from the Bible?
[S18] Pages from the Bible
[S19] I think you’re going to hell for that.
[S18] Yeah, yeah /I know /it’s like aw dude I don’t have a bowl /uh don’t worry about it /he like opens the Bible and rips out /he takes out the Bible /some random kid’s Bible /so the poor kid’s missing like Joshua 13:6 or something like that
[Laughter]
[S20] Wow.
[S18] Weren’t we on Myspace? How’d we get on like holy joints?
[Laughter]
Everything goes back to drugs.
[S19] We were just talking about where schools should cross the line.
[S20] Where would you guys draw the line? Did we just have this conversation?
[S19] Well, I definitely don’t think if you don’t have probably cause /you definitely shouldn’t be searching people’s lockers /cause they /my school took days where they would shut down the commons and search all of the lockers and that commons ya know is that area
[S20] We would always have the infamous code orange. Cause ever since 9-11 where we practiced in case terrorists came into our school because 
[S18] Code magenta! Code violet-blue.
[S20] Well like /in case terrorists would ya know /wanted to go into our high school /because that’s a totally legitimate thing /and so like we would all like corner into like a corner and uh 
[S19] That’s the stupidest thing.
[S20] That’s when they would bring the dogs out and
[S18] Against the wall, right? 
[S20] You wanted to stay away from the windows /you’re all looking to see if the ninjas would fly in through the windows 
[Laughter]
[S17] We had to put paper on that little thing /that little glass thing
[S20] Yup /it was ridiculous /it was all just like
[S19] They told you they were just doing it as like a practice in case terrorists stormed into school? I thought it was a joke, seriously /[laughter] /that’s hilarious
[S18] That’s a great idea /I mean that’s /that’s ingenuity and creativity 
[S20] That’s Maryland for ya
[S19] Why would terrorists target a high school?
[S20] Exactly, exactly/ or also school shootings
[S19] Yeah, we did it for school shootings /I mean which is likely /but if the kid goes to the school he’s obviously gonna know that like everybody is hiding in their classrooms /hoping that they don’t knock on the door
[S18] Where did everybody go?
[Laughter]
[S19] I guess I picked the wrong day to shoot up the school. Everyone is gone. What are the odds /like two thousand kids in my public school /like nobody in sight /like obviously yeah it’s ridiculous
[S18] Yeah /I don’t /I don’t know /I mean for drawing the line as far as privacy’s concerned /I mean there’s real no tangible line /I mean you’d have to use examples and then like you’d have to discuss whether it’s 
[S20] Take it example by example I guess
[S18] By /like for example this /I mean the Myspace and the Facebook /I think we’re all in concordance there / for the school shootings at least /it was not /it was not um invasion of privacy /but yeah if you go to a private school /I mean yeah /they have the right to do random drug testing /I mean it’s a private school /public school /I mean I don’t know about that
[S20] Would you think that the line should be any different
[S18] For public and private schools? Yeah of course.
[S20] Why should it though?
[S18] Why should it?
[S20] You pay, you pay them more and then they go further into your privacy
[S18] Well, no, private schools /I mean to a certain extent are like a business /I mean they have their own interest to look out for /It’s a privilege to go there /I mean you’re paying or you’re parents are payin to go there /are paying for you to go there /so uh 
[S29] I think you should retain more rights at a private school than you should a public school.
[S17] I think you’re paying for your rights.
[S19] Kind of /well, because I mean I did both of you go to public school?
[S17] I went to public
[S19] I went to public
[S18] I guess the grass is always greener on the other side
[S20] I went to a private college
[Laughter]
[S17] But /I mean /I guess maybe /well did you live at your school?
[S18] Wait /what are you /did like
[S17] Did you
[S19] Was it like a boarding school or was it just private?
[Laughter]
[S18] Dude, our private school was worse than all three public schools, except that it dint have drugs in it /and that was like /yeah /I mean people would come /well it did have drugs in it but like /I mean the thing with the high school was it was small enough /I mean people didn’t have locks on their lockers /the public school would come and be like you don’t have locks for your lockers /this is not like oh yeah we all love each other /this was like something’s gone from my locker and school’s small enough that I can find out who and kick the crap out of him but like / yeah
[S20] What were you trying to say?
[S18] Yeah, yeah you were trying to say something before.
[S17] Oh yeah, I do remember it. /Just like everyone should have the same amount of rights /it’s like a human needer /whatever human rights /it’s  not  a case by same thing /like this person goes to private school so they get more or less rights than this person 
[S18] Well but I think the private institution should decide how many rights they /I mean /cause I mean if you /if they don’t  /if the private institution says alright this is where we’re gonna draw the line then if you’re saying hey you cant do that /you’re like alright you’re paying to be here /if you don’t like it then why are you paying to be here /go somewhere else /it’s a private institution /I mean that’s what I was trying to get at with that but um /yeah
[S19] I don’t know /I think with a public school I guess since the lockers are technically school property /that gives them the right to search lockers /I think as far as backpacks and cars go /like 
[S18] Cars. [laughter]
[S19] No /after a school dance /one kid when into a school dance drunk /bad decision, yes /but like his car was parked in like the school’s parking lot and so they like broke into his car and opened up his trunk
[S17] They broke into his car?
[S19] Yeah /they searched his car /like without his permission
[S18] That’s illegal search and procedure
[S19] Yeah, exactly. My school they /my town basically they
[S20] It’s weird those schools get away with so much.
[S19] It’s not even just the school /it’s the whole town and police will take advantage of you not knowing like a law like in a heartbeat
[S18] I love that thing /you ever see that thing like if a policeman ever comes to your door /like ask to see the warrants /like you do not have to speak to them /like
[S17] Like fifth amendment
[S18] Like be courteous
[Laughter]
[S19] They’re come into your house if they think you’re having a party /they’ll come into your house /they’ll arrest everyone there /even if you don’t invite them
[S18] You can shoot them.
[Laughter]
I love to tell that story. This is a good invasion of privacy story /did you hear about the [inaudible] guy in Texas? /that got shot? /guy was in the shower and the [inaudible] guy came to take his truck /right? /and he was using the shower so he didn’t hear the doorbell ring /so uh the [inaudible] guy’s like oh I guess he’s not home /so he goes to take his truck and he like /he doesn’t break into his truck /I mean he opens the truck cause he’s gonna take it away /and the guy gets out the shower /looks out the window and he sees some guy breaking into his truck /so he takes a towel and wraps it around his waist /just takes this double barrel shot gun /runs out and shoots em point blank in the head and kill him /he gets off scot-free cause /it’s his house man /someone’s stealing his car /it’s the extreme but it’s the invasion of privacy
[S20] How’s that invasion of privacy?
[S19] Cause they’re stealing his car
[S17] That doesn’t make it legal to kill someone
[S18] Cause he was under the belief that the guy was stealing his uh
[S20] How’s that an invasion of privacy though?
[S18] It’s not /but I mean it’s like it just goes to show how like loose the phrase invasion of privacy can be like /that’s really the point I was trying to make with that /It was just a cool story
[Laughter]
[S10] I appreciate that. A cool story is always appreciated.
[S19] Like /I don’t know I think if it’s like personal property and no one has the right to search it without a warrant
[S18] Please do not take this seriously, but I could say like I have an AK47 in my room /it’s my private property /[laughter] /like hopefully if any Loyola College police officer heard me say that they’d be like what’s your ID number? /Where do you live? /and like run up to my room and search /cause that’s like something /I guess it’s just a personal thing /like I’d rather have less freedoms /I mean if you’re law-abiding and you got nothing to hide /even if you’re not law-abiding like wink, wink, nudge, nudge /and you got some stuff in your room you don’t want them to see /if you’re wise enough /you’ll never get caught
[S19] Yeah, but even with like what /stuff on Loyola’s campus /like Loyola can come in and search your room if they want /like this isn’t our property /it’s their property /they have every right in the world to come and search it /but if I have a house down the street from the campus and they want to search my house they can’t because it’s my house
[S18] Exactly, yeah /that’s the point I’m making
[S19] So, yeah if it’s the school’s property go ahead /[laughter] /The do it anyways with or without your permission /so
[S18] Plus, they make little safes that look like coca-cola cans.
[S19] And like I know a girl who /her /freshman year her roommate um got in trouble for credit card fraud or something like that
[Laughter]
[S20] What?
[S19] I know, and like no one else of the roommates had anything to do with it, but like Lo-Po was kinda huge dicks about it and was like we’re searching your room with or without your permission /if you do it with /like if you let us do it now then you can stay here and watch and ya know /so she was like fine you can search it not knowing that like they don’t search her room /like if she doesn’t want them to search her room
[S17] Ohh. She didn’t know she could have said no.
[S19] Yeah, she didn’t know she could have said no /but if she let them search her room like she had a locked trunk in her room /they made her open it and like how would her roommate like get into her locked trunk
[S18] People should know that stuff though
[S19] Yeah. But then afterwards /um /like a couple days later she came back and her room was completely trashed cause Lo-Po came in and searched her room when she wasn’t there anyways /[laughter] /so
[S20] That’s bull.
[S19] I think that’s kind of crossing the line because you can’s say one thing
[S20] That’s totally crossing the line
[S18] I’d get all over the Loyola police for that.
[S20] I’d just get my uh tuition’s worth out of that /needless to say
[S19] Yeah
[S18] Pigs
[Laughter]
[You guys have any other thoughts on the issue of privacy?]
[S18] Yeah. Myspace is stupid.
[Laughter]
That’s about it.
[Is that good? That’s it? Ok, end of discussion.]
