GROUP1234
GENDER DISCRIMINATION
[Ok. Do you feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the present day United States, and if so what can we do to change that?]
[S2] I think it still is an issue /but um /I think it was more of an issue in the past and like nowadays it’s not as widespread
[S4] And it falls on the individual to /you know /lead their own life /not make excuses for anything
[S1] I feel like even if we’re there where every single law they could ever possibly cover /where everything had to be equal /you weren’t allowed to discriminate /there would still be people who thought that /so I mean you really /I feel like /I agree with you /that there’s been a lot /especially with the equal pay laws where you’re not allowed to pay a woman less or even the man less /I guess depending on the business /they’re not allowed to pay you for something less /pay a person less for the same job /all those kind of things /they’ve really evened it out a lot
[S4] I think employers today just care about skills. They don’t have time to deal with gender discrimination because like /if you have a woman with the same skill set as a man or even a better skill set /if you reject her and hire the man you’re company’s going to be worse off because you didn’t hire the 
[S1] The better, more skilled for the job
[S3] Well /um /my sister recently got a job and they openly told her in their interview /we’re looking for women /you know /they’re /they were only interviewing women /you know /or 
[S2] What kind of job was it?
[S3] Engineering /so whether that was to explained because of prior issue of not having enough women or to /you know /now they’re getting to a point where they realize they have ninety men and two women in their company and they need more /I don’t know but she said /she noted that to me and /you know /so for that particular job /I mean there’s still gonna be people nudged out /if you have the same /you know /criteria or background as my sister /for example, if you applied to get that job /she would have got it simply because /so
[S1] Right /I mean
[S3] Whether it’s not /you know /it’s not like well you’re a woman and you’re out /you know /because you’re a woman and we don’t like women here and we don’t like /you know/ the things that women do /it’s what do we need in our company to weigh it out /so it still goes on
[S1] Right, and its reverse discrimination too because in that case it’s like no men here.
[S2]  A lot of times /well the /one of the main problems I have with this entire issue is like a lot of time there’ll be situations where people will say that it’s gender discrimination like in some decision that some employer makes or whatever /but I mean how can you know that there aren’t other factors to take into that like I mean /how can you be so sure that it’s just because of gender? /that a certain like decision was made /I mean in certain decisions where it’s so like obvious /then like /then I would definitely say discriminating against gender is like wrong /but I think most situations you can’t really say for sure
[S1] Yeah, we’re quick to jump to that, but maybe you don’t get the job and you come home and you’re mad and it’s like /it’s because I’m a woman! /but like it might not be /you might not have been good at the job /[laughter] /like it’s just as easy /it could be something like that /I agree with you
[S2] Or it could just be arbitrary /I mean if you’re going /if there’s a man against a woman and they have the same skill set /if /you know if they choose one /the other could yell gender discrimination /but I mean it was just an arbitrary decision
[S3] Right /based on how your interview went or
[S1] Yeah, it could be based on your personality /it could be based on anything
[S3] Right /but if you look at the /I believe /this is my side of the prior thing /if you look at the pay for woman and men /women’s is still /you know where men are getting paid $7 per hour /woman are still getting paid /you know /a dollar less or fifty cents less nationally /that’s the average so there still /you know /a problem /in the same jobs people are still getting paid less as women
[S2] But that is the same job? It’s not because of different
[S3] Yes, it is. Um /I don’t know exactly /I’m not great on the /ya know /details of it /but I have read an article that it’s still /it’s not a huge gap /it used to be dollars /it used to be a huge deal /you know women couldn’t even go in to apply for certain jobs, but it’s still somewhat of an issue
[S1] There’s still more that needs to be done. I mean we’ve gotten away from the women stay home and take care of the kids idea of the past /but there is still things that need to be done /and I mean that /and it’s kinda funny now too because men are actually discriminated against when they want to stay home and take care of the kids /because then it’s like your wife makes all the money /[laughter] /and those kind of things /whereas /and there’s nothing wrong with that either /there’s no reason you can’t be like a Mr. Mom they call it /but you know /but
[S2] I also think its kind of important having a Mom that’s there to stay home and take care of the kids. I mean I think like /like kids nowadays /these like little five year-olds that run around with like cell phones and everything are just like kids that are dropped off at the day-care at like six o’clock and picked up at eight at night
[S1] No, I definitely agree with that, but I don’t see the difference between a mother and a father /whereas
[S2] Yeah
[S1] Life if /I mean there are some differences /a woman is you know probably gonna /but a woman is known to be more nurturing and like those kind of things but there’s no reason a father couldn’t do it /and there’s no reason a father couldn’t be a stay at home dad /but I agree with you when the kids are just dropped off and left somewhere /it doesn’t always work out as well /but um in the case of whether you’re mom or dad is taking care of you when you’re at home /it doesn’t seem to be much of a difference
[S3] Yup
[S4] I think it’s important to note that there are just some jobs that favor men or some that favor women /like if you’re a cosmetics /you know dealer /you’d probably take a woman over a man
[S1] Right, and for most construction jobs they’ll take a big man over like me /[laughter] 
[S4] And there are some people that will complain about gender discrimination if they can’t get that job, but it’s just because they’re not suited to it.
[S3] Yeah, like I saw a man working at Victoria Secret once and I was like, really? I mean, this is what you wanted?
[S2] Well, also I feel /I mean I don’t know if this is gender discrimination, but I mean I feel that women are more like suited /like naturally to care for like the young or the children or whatever
[S1] Oh, yeah
[S3] Oh, absolutely
[S2] Like I mean /like a kid /I mean kids when they grow up they want mommy /like you know? /it’s not like
[S3] It’s a natural instinct /I mean when you develop for nine months inside of someone /you’re /you know /I mean you’re /think about it /you know /you go through the whole /women go through the whole delivery process /and there are some women that are completely unaffected by it /they don’t think of it as their childhood /but, that’s a different point /but, you go through the whole delivery process whereas the father is just handed this baby /where you know /while it is partially theirs /you know /you can see /you know /some of your characteristics and traits and you know /it’s still a baby that’s handed to you as if /you know /kind of any other baby /so it’s natural you’re gonna be more attached to your mother
[S1] Oh yeah /and I do /I do agree that the point I was trying to make with that is like there’s not /I mean besides the whole fact of how you think you’re kids should be raised /there’s nothing wrong with the father not making the money /like they always say like /in like Leave It to Beaver when the dad comes home from work and the mom has the apron on and she’s making dinner /like we’ve just come so far from that /whereas even now like the mom and the dad go to work in the morning and then they come home around the same time /and then sure the mom cooks dinner /but like she /but she also went to work all day /and it’s /we’re away from that where it had to be like the woman wasn’t allowed to work /whereas now, if she chooses not to, that’s fine /but, you don’t have to stay at home
[S3] Or even now there’s two moms or two dads
[S1] Exactly, that’s true also.
[S3] Things are so much different now.
[S1] Yeah /I mean I guess relationships in general /like in that sense
[S2] I feel like if a man were to try to take that role like oh, I’m gonna stay home and take care of the kids /it’d just be like everyone would say he’s a deadbeat and has to go get a job and
[S1] Right, whereas a woman sits and it’s like oh that’s so nice /she’s s housewife /no, I agree with that /and that’s where the discrimination part comes in because you look and you’re like wait you couldn’t get a job anywhere? /but it’s like no, I wanted to stay home with my kids
[S4] Right, so it goes both ways.
[S1] Oh definitely
[S3] I mean economically, sometimes the wife can make more money /you know /and it’s more intelligent for the family /you know if she’s gonna make /you know six figures and the husband’s not /why, what’s /why wouldn’t you?
[S1] Yeah, my aunt is the CEO of a company and my uncle does have a job, but it’s not making nearly as much as she is /and I mean as long as they’re Ok with that /you’re not gonna have her be like no you have to stay home so I can work here at McDonald’s /[laughter] /like you’re not gonna make that decision
[S3] Right
[S4] I think it’s a pride issue. Like the man /for a man to have his wife make more than him /I don’t know /just from the beginning of time the husband has like gone out and caught dinner and all that /so society’s adapting /I don’t know, it’s just 
[S3] Slowly
[S4] Right
[S3] I mean I think that /ya know /my dad still has the same mental /ya know /dinner’s there when he gets home /and my mom was a stay-at-home mom /so my house was pretty traditional and that’s the way that ya know /when a dad stays home it’s not weird /but my dad /he doesn’t work he stays home with the kids /my mom would be like yeah, alright /but um /yeah I stayed in a pretty traditional home
[S1] It would be pretty interesting to see when /I mean even when there are kinds of homes /they’re a lot less traditional /but even now when we become parents and when we’re older /it’s gonna be kind of funny because you could like /cause now whereas I’m sure your parents didn’t go to a lot of dinner parties with like their two lesbian friends or like things like that /or whereas it might be /with every generation it gets more and more /so I mean maybe /like maybe you are gonna make a lot more money than your husband /you know like that kinda thing /whereas I feel like it’s gonna be like a lot less traditional as we get older and as the generations keep /cause I mean even the world we grew up in was a lot different than our parents
[S3] Definitely.
[S2] What do you guys think about like the feminist movement /like in general?
[S3] Sometimes I love it and sometimes I hate it /[laughter] /it’s like uh ya know I like that I can play sports competitively /ya know all the way up to a professional /I like that I have that opportunity or to make as much or more than ya know my husband or whoever /um however I don’t like sometimes /I think sometimes even stay-at-home moms are looked down on now as weak /ya know /I don’t know very many people when I was growing up who had mothers who were always at home /like it /there was like /ya know /a handful of people in my class /ya know as I grew up it got less and less /ya know both parents were at work /cause I mean my mom is still not working so I mean she’s always been home /she does have a small job /but, it’s always been she’s at home and she was there with snacks when I got home /it’s very, very traditional /so ya know I don’t /I would like to have that option /if I get out of college /even if I go on to get my Ph.D. /but if I have kids, my opinion is that I’m probably going to stay home because that’s how I feel personally that a family should be raised /so a lot of people look down on that, and I don’t like that idea of the feminist movement
[S1] No, I agree. I did the same kind of thing where my mom worked and then she had kids and stayed home for the entire eighteen years that I was a kid, and now she’s working. But /and it’s the same kind of thing where I would never want to /that’s the same way I would want to do it /I would want to raise my kids /I don’t want to watch them be raised /I would like to raise them /so I wouldn’t /I don’t like that people look at me like, really you don’t work? /where it should be ok
[S4] I think the feminist movement sometimes tries to find conflict where there is none. They’ll see men as the enemy /and you know it’s just not the case
[S3] Yeah, it’s funny cause I see it /cause even my mom /you know /I’ll say something of what I just said /of that nature /when I get out of college if I have kids I’m gonna stay home and raise them and she’s like, why I paid so much for your education and I wanted you to be this /this feminist /um, person that I couldn’t have /you know /she didn’t go to college /so the opportunity that I didn’t have /I wanted you to have them and /you know /but, um /I think that also being a female is having option /you can do that or you can not get married and have a successful life as that or you know /there should be tons of options /I think that’s a privilege you should gain from this movement
[S2] I’m not sure like for sure /but to me it seems like feminists are trying to like close the gap between like /the differences between like men and women /almost trying to like make them equal /like exactly /and I think that like that’s kind of a dangerous 
[S3] You can never have that happen.
[S2] Even like a dangerous thing to approach /I mean 
[S1] And it’s just not going to be reached /they need a realistic goal
[S2] Yeah
[S1] It’s never gonna be completely 
[S2] That too
[S3] We’re not the same. It’s been proven that men and women don’t think the same. They don’t do the same things, they don’t react to things in the same way /you know
[S2] So, I think /uh / it’s shown that like men are better at math and women are better at like /kind alike analytical problems 
[S1] That’s even the same if you ever like gotten into a fight with someone of the opposite sex /like you have two completely different views on everything, and at first you’re like why do you always disagree with me? /But like it’s just really where like two completely different /I mean we use different parts of our brain even /and some of the smaller parts of our brain /obviously we use some of the same parts, but there are like little chemical differences where like we use a part of our brain that you don’t and you use a part of your brain that we don’t /so like you need /you can’t be completely the same /we’re not at all
[S3] Right
[S4] And men and women will just fall under different jobs /like nobody’s forcing men to be more predominant in like engineering /that’s just the way the chips fall
[S3] Mmhmm
[S1] Maybe engineering /the classes here there’s like thirty people and it’s like 27 boys and 3 girls
[S4] Right
[S1] And no one’s forcing them /anyone who walks in here can be an engineer, but there’s mostly men in that /what do you think would be different if there was a woman president? Mot necessarily Hilary because I know that’s a whole different issue /but like a woman president
[S4] I think there’s an issue of like other countries maybe viewing us as weaker just because of their voice on 
[S3] Oh yeah, definitely.
[S2] Especially with the whole conflict in the Middle East right now, I mean 
[S1] In these countries women have no power
[S2] How women are treated there is terrible
[S1] Yeah, they’re not even allowed 
[S3] To speak publicly
[S1] Yeah I mean you can’t even see their face /you can’t /there’s all those kinds of things and then all of a sudden there’s this woman who’s this public figurehead of American basically
[S3] Right /and whereas I /as a woman
[S2] Yeah, that would be really bad for us.
[S3] Right. I would love to see /uh you know /uh /theoretically the whole woman as a president would be great for many /as a woman, for me /but um /I don’t think that the world’s ready for it /and in my heart of hearts I just know that it’s not the right time
[S4] There’s also the issue of a woman being the Commander in Chief /which is just /I don’t know /in my opinion /most generals are males so /I don’t know /maybe a woman president wouldn’t be able to understand /I don’t know /I’m sure they’d be able to understand /but /I don’t know what I’m saying
[S1] No, I know what you’re saying, and I think it’s something like even /as much as we’re saying the other countries may not be ready for it /as much as /there’s a large part of our country that’s not ready for it
[S3] Yeah
[S1] I mean we’d have people rebelling all over the place /[laughter] /I mean like I’m not gonna follow that law, she made it /and be like really juvenile about it /but I mean like I don’t think we have enough of our country that’s ready for it
[S3] They might not be able to pass anything /pass any laws /you know make any changes /it’d be a /it would be a completely dead four years in the United States
[S1] I mean women have come a long way, and like they’re even /I mean women are in high power and there are a lot of things /there are companies run by women /ya know there are all those kind of things /but a country, I’m like not so sure
[S3] And the thing about it is /you /I mean I almost think this a little bit /for a woman to be successful in that role, would she have to act like a man? /and present /not present like look like /but present her ideals as more of on like a man’s perspective to achieve what she needed to /to
[S2] Well, what do you mean by like a man’s perspective?
[S3] Well, you know /I mean well people think she just thinks that because she’s a woman /like I think people everywhere think that /like even about what Hilary Clinton says /well, she’s a woman you know /they would have to present it differently /I think from maybe the way they would /I mean cause women tend to appeal to more emotional and different aspects when they’re trying to achieve a goal /not even emotional but /um / women go about different ways of achieving things than men /it’s you know different thought processes /so would they have to change the way they present things to get anything done and you know in the senate and anything
[S1] And then it also becomes /whereas like a male president is more of they say, they feel, they act how they are /I mean obviously you’re taking into account a lot of things, but for a woman it would almost be that other layer of now I’m going to have to think about /they’re going to say just because I’m a woman that I said that /and you’d have to like have that whole aspect in there
[S3] Mmhmm.
[S4] I think you have to keep in mind that /you know/ people can vote for a man or a woman /so
[S1] Right /I mean if she /if /and even in this case /like Hilary /if she doesn’t win /it’s not gonna be /I mean that’s the way the country’s feeling at this point
[S4] Including women
[S1] Including women too / I mean it’s not /we’re way past where only men can vote /like it’s /[laughter] /it’s gonna be women /I mean if she loses, it’s going to be that women didn’t want her either /it’s not just going to be the men
[S2] My Mom herself believes that /she doesn’t want to see a woman president
[S1] I mean even if we /even if we just saw
[S3] I don’t.
[S1] I don’t want to see it now /I mean I’d love to see it sometime when we were all ready for it /but we’re /I don’t know /I don’t want to see it yet
[S3] Not this one.
[Laughter]
[S4] Although it has happened in other countries /like in Britain with Margaret Thatcher in the 80’s /she was Prime Minister /that seemed to work
[S1] I think we might need a different candidate to consider.
[Laughter]
[S4] Right, I’m not saying [inaudible]
[S2] The U.S. is just like too hot right now with all issues and we’re too spread out all over the world in too many different conflicts. I mean England I think was /I mean I’m not /you know /a big history buff /but I feel as thought England was a lot more passive than like we are like now
[S4] We’re a much bigger player.
[S3] And with /with the War in Iraq /it’s just not a good time for such a drastic /and it is a drastic change /there’s never been /there’s no way you can look about it as it’s just another president /it’s not /it’s always been a man
[S2] Oh of course, yeah
[S3] It’s always /it’s a huge change /I mean even for a person whose not a white male /it’s gonna be a change /it’s gonna be something people are look at that person differently /it’d be great if everybody could look past the fact that she’s a woman or 
[S1] We can’t /I mean 
[S3] If we have an African American male running too /I mean there would be a big change if that happened. There’d be people that weren’t or were extremely happy about that so
[S1] Cause it’s enough of a change to change from one white, male president to another white, male president /that’s like a huge change /like we’re gonna see it when it does change it’s gonna be ridiculous /when everything changes /cause who knows if they agree with exactly everything that the last president agreed with and then trying to throw in another factor /and I mean as much as we’re even /and this goes back to gender discrimination in any sense too /like we said /no matter what, no matter how you think you’ve changed everything you can possibly change /there’s gonna be that guy or that girl who says, no they can’t do it because they’re a woman or they can’t do it because they’re black or they can’t /anything like that /there’s going to be people /no matter /you can try and brain wash everyone in the country /there’s gonna be people who still don’t believe it
[S2] Especially in a country like America where everybody’s so different, and on so many different pages.
[S1] Right, and you’re allowed /and like we’re actually as long as we don’t act violently against it /you’re allowed to think what you want /you’re allowed to say what you want /so in a country like this it would be hard /I’m sure in certain countries that have like oppression and things like that it’s /they might think it, but they wouldn’t say it and they’re not acting out about it /but here there’s nothing really holding us back from saying, she did that because she’s a woman /ya know? /or anything like that /so it would be hard to get past that
[S3] And as we said there’s still people who expect women to be at home cooking dinner and there are still people that are extremely racist /I mean there’s people in the south that still think there’s gonna be a Confederate uprising again /I mean that’s how back far behind /and that’s not a joke /you go down there and there’s people still with Confederate flags on their porch /it’s like some people just aren’t to /ya know? /aren’t as accepting as you know some people /so until we get to that point /I mean it might be really bad to have any kind of drastic change /still I mean we made such, such progress /just think of like since my Mom was college age or my grandmother /and that wasn’t /that was less than a century ago which is pretty drastic change I think
[S1] Oh definitely /it’s been /there’s been so much change /so many changes and obviously all these have /cause we talk about most of them /there’s been so many changes within the past even fifty years that it’s like amazing /the amount of change that can occur in such a little bit of time /but even with all the change, I still don’t think this is something that shouldn’t be happening yet
[S2] Gender discrimination wasn’t even an issue until like fifty years ago until people started being like hey
[S1] Now, wait a minute, why don’t we vote? /like
[S4] I think the feminist movement had it’s place maybe fifty, sixty years ago /but today I mean they’ve closed the gap so much 
[S2] The job is done.
[S4] Yeah, right.
[S3] Umm /maybe
[S1] On certain issues
[S3] Yeah
[S1] There’s still some things that they could be
[S3] And there’s even issues where we haven’t asked for too much.
[S1] Of course /but even now /even just the one issue that seems to be like really prevalent of abortion /where like I know some people are definitely taking it too far /some people not taking it far enough and fine /but it’s an issue and kind of there is no decision about yet /so until there is /like that’s the kind of issue where I believe the feminist issue has kind of went a little too far on a lot of things /but there are some current issues that kind of /they have opinions and it’s enough of an opinion that needs to be voiced /and this is a decision they just /I don’t honestly know what it is, but they just made a ruling about abortion, and I can’t tell you what it is because I forgot /but this is something /abortion is something that’s being changed as we speak right now /like there are people arguing it right now /so those kinds of issues /you do have to be fighting for /but there are a lot of things I think they can stop with or not begin with /but I mean even /there are things that are going on right now
[S2] Also with the feminist movement /I’m not sure if this is entirely true, but it seems to me that like the connotation of like a typical feminist /like focuses more on like a hatred for like the male than like trying to help like females /as into raise their position
[S1] And that’s where it becomes different too /because what it should be is not I hate all males so give me what I want /it should just be give me what I want /[laughter] /and it should just be kind of I’m fighting for women /not fighting for being against men for women /just fighting for women /I agree /um people need to stop on that one too
[S3] I think the origins of that is when the feminist movement started /they were put down as if they didn’t have a mind or you know /a reason to think that they couldn’t change the things they wanted to change /and um I don’t know /I just think that based on that the original feelings of /wouldn’t you hate men if they treated you like that, you know? /like said you didn’t have a mind to think and said you’re brains are smaller and the things that /originally, in the beginning of the feminist movement /so I think that mindset may have stayed with 
[S2] It’s kinds just like trends that have developed over time /like /I mean it’s not like the male as like a conscious collective decided to just discriminate against women /I mean like we said /like from the beginning of time the male has always had that position as like the /you know the alpha going out and getting the food and the /stuff like that
[S1] I feel like as much as it was as issue in the beginning because every time a woman opened her mouth she’d be put in jail even from when they were trying to get the right to vote and they’d all be put in jail /so it’s the kind of thing where they’re /I understand that /being the alpha male /but I don’t personally /I don’t think there’s a lot of people now who are feeling that /like I don’t feel oppressed right now /I’m ok /you know like those kind of things /like I don’t feel like that /so I think it could be lessened in the fact that yes /it was /men were very pushy in the beginning, but we don’t need to necessarily think that way exactly right now
[S4] And there are men too who will fight for women’s issues
[S3] Mmhmm /absolutely
[S4] Like /um /abortion /there are men who are pro-choice /so
[S1] Oh yeah /it’s definitely not just a woman’s fight /especially for abortion
[So /um /for the issues where you think there still is discrimination, how do you think we could be able to go about changing that today?]
[S4] I don’t know if you can actively change it. It just kind of has to happen.
[S2] Yeah, there are no solid laws that you can really like put it /cause like I mean what we said before where /I mean you can’t really tell whether it’s discrimination against gender /it’s never so clear-cut like that /where you can just say for sure
[S4] Maybe, the world will never /you know /see women as equal
[S2] And also /you know /it’s people on their own that have to /or women or men that are on their own that have to take those /I guess women mostly for the jobs /have to /I mean like we said anyone coming into the school could go become an engineer
[S3] I know, and I think that currently /I’d say the majority of women are /at least in the United States are happy with the /with the rights that we have and the rules /you know more than happy /I /at this point, if nothing changed for the rest of my life, I’m pretty sure I could live a good life and have everything I wanted out of life
[S1] Right /and I don’t /I mean as in changing what we think is different /a lot of it is the person that’ll come along /you’re not allowed to think bad things about women because that’s not /that’s never /you know /gonna be effective /so and there’s no /I can’t see besides /and even these /this whole like abortion issue which is a big issue now is not necessarily a gender discrimination issue /it’s not like men are allowed to get abortions and women aren’t /ya know /not like that kind of thing
[S3] Right
[S1] So, it’s not /as much as that is an issue that directly involved on gender /it’s not necessarily a gender discrimination issue /so I don’t know if
[S3] It’s more of a moral issue.
[S1] Exactly, so I don’t know if there are actually any big gender discrimination issues cause like you said people are gonna say /people are gonna say forever /if you are not allowed to gender discriminate /people are gonna be like I was not allowed to do that because I am a woman /you know /it’s gonna happen so there are not really any set laws you can make right now, I don’t think
[S3] And I don’t think that /I don’t personally don’t think that women and men are ever going to be or should be made out to be equals because they might be equals, but they’re not the same /I mean they’re just not the same /they’re not kept the same /I don’t think they should ever be
[Does anyone have any other comments about men being discriminated against? Instances that you can think of?]
[S1] I mean it’s not nearly as prevalent /and again all of these issues now /it’s not the gender discrimination of the past where it was women can’t vote or you know women have to stay home /those kinds of things /but I mean now I think that as a gender men kinda get put off as like /they get called like certain names now like you’re like a pig /you know, all those kind of things /but all of those are still opinions /so I really don’t know if there’s a lot of like 
[S3] I think one thing in /um /in court /I ‘m pretty sure the judges will openly say in the matter of a divorce /um /a lot of the rights of /what’s the word I’m looking for? /uh /children
[S4] Custody
[S3] Custody, that’s it. Um, women will win /you know if there’s a situation, women will get the rights over you know a father in any instances that are beyond /you know the control of the father /unless there’s an obvious problem with the mother /I think that’s still an issue
[S4] I think that stems from the /uh /father being the primary bread winner as opposed to the women who just stays home
[S1] And also there’s that whole like we were talking about before /like the age old like women are the mothers and we /how we were talking about how even when men stay at home it’s not that they can’t do it, but a mother gives a different [inaudible] /so again unless there’s something wrong with the mother /I don’t know if they’d be very willing to give the father the kids /which again I mean in a personal like /if it were my parents getting divorced like there’s not really / I mean I feel especially being older /like my /you know what I mean /like I don’t know how much of a difference there is, but in some situations I think they just automatically award the mother it because they’re assuming she’s more nurturing and better for the children
[S2] I could see how the courts could be more in favor of giving women the kids because if I had like my kid and I was giving it to like a day care  /and there were just like two people that were exactly the same standing next to each other /and one’s a man and one’s a woman /I mean I would want the woman to take care of my kid just cause /I don’t know /I feel like women are more like /I don’t know better suited to take care of kids than men are /more natural
[S3] In general, yeah
[S2] Yeah
[Ok.]
