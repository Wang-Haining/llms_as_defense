IRAQ WAR
[Is everyone ready to begin? Just try to speak up too, in front of everybody. Alright /the controversial War in Iraq has made news headlines almost everyday since it began. How do you feel about the war? And who would like to begin?]
[S10] I’ll start. Um /I’m /um /fairly opposed to the United States /um /occupation in Iraq /um /I think that it has gone on for /beginning in the first place was probably a bad idea /but um /given the circumstances this is going on for entirely too long now /and um /no matter what the outcome /um /may end up being /it’s a loss /if you’re going to go [inaudible] which is the United States /people usually look at every situation /it would be a L /a loss /I don’t think you can really justify /um /any other way /even at this point /if um /the Iraqi people thirty years from now have a flourishing democracy /which won’t happen /um /you have to look at what’s already transpired and say that um /it’s a failure
[S11] See, I don’t think we should have gone in, but I think pulling out now /just pulling out and leaving nothing behind would be a big mistake. I mean look what happened in Haiti, look what happened in other situations where we’ve done that before and it’s just been a disaster. I mean, I think just pulling out would hurt them even more than staying would.
[S9] Indeed, I think that one of the major criticisms /um / of the U.S. by other countries in the world has been that we never stick with anything /that we go into all these countries and then pull out without leaving them secure or /um on good standing or anything like that /um /so /while I’m also /I don’t believe that we should have invaded Iraq in the first place /I think that at least Bush oughta get some credit for sticking it out /um /or at least it seems like that’s /um / is different from what previous presidents have done, and it’s something that the rest of the world has called for /um /so maybe it’s kind of an answer to that criticism
[S11] Well, the thing is also it’s not just Bush /it’s the congress, it’s the senate, it everything /and a lot of people just think of it as being Bush /they say, oh it’s Bush, it’s Bush /but, he couldn’t have gone in without getting the consent
[S9] Although, the way it is now /a lot of people in congress are against staying /so I say that
[S10] He said that he would veto any bill that would pertain to them leaving. I mean he’s been open about the fact that he wants to stay there, and the congress is almost an afterthought. Even though, they traditionally /and I guess by the laws / should have stayed
[S11] Well, I mean in going in /I was talking about going in 
[S10] Oh ok.
[S11] Going in /in general
[S10] Oh, you’re saying in the first place
[S11] Uh /in the first place, he couldn’t have gone in without them saying anything
[S10] Would you guys all agree though? The longer you stay in there the more it becomes modern day colonialism?
[S11] I don’t know, I really don’t think so. I don’t think we’re trying to put in the same democracy that we have here. We’re trying to put in a government that works, and whatever that may be /that’s what it’ll be /it’s just
[S10] It’s whatever works best for us.
[S11] No, it’s not whatever works best for us /I don’t think /I don’t think so /I think that we’re trying to help them, it’s not really about us.
[S9] See, I think that the United States does try to help other countries or at least they think that they try to help other countries, but the thing is they don’t actually understand the culture of other countries /and they don’t understand that what works in America will not work everywhere else, and /er /I mean people /I mean this has happened to the United States before /I mean even in places like South America /the United States has implemented democracies and then /and then the people once they’re in the functioning democracy /they elect someone that the United States doesn’t like and then they try to /I think the United States wants to have too much control
[S11] I can agree with that.
[S9] Over /and it just doesn’t work because other countries, different cultures, different histories /I mean it’s not like our government when it first began was functioning all that well in the beginning /it took a long time for it 
[S11] What, two hundred years /for it to at least settle down?
[S9] And I mean /what /we had a Civil War in /over a hundred years after the country was founded so /it’s /I think it was extremely unrealistic expectations going in
[S11] Oh, absolutely
[S9] I mean /and even on the part of the American people because a lot of the American people supported it at the beginning /the
[S11] I think  a lot of the American people supported it also because it was right after 9-11. They were feeding off fear.
[S10] Yeah, that’s /that’s / I agree with that /I mean 
[S11] It’s not /It’s not that /I think it’s good that’s Saddam is out of power /we went in for the wrong reasons though /we went in by feeding off of the fear that the American people had after 9-11 /after they hyped up that fear /they immediately hyped up that fear /it’s the war on terror /which is really not the war on terror /it’s not
[S10] It was similar to like Kosovo was where you go in and take down a dictator who oppressed people of a certain nationality within their country /but that’s like another difference I guess that you don’t /I mean how many Americans know the difference between /you know the Sunnis and the Shiites /which would be the largest internal problem that they have in that country /and the Baptists or whatever you want to say /the different political parties /and we didn’t do anything about that /so they’re all in favor of going to help out /you know a country /but, within that country there’s so many subdivisions that
[S11] Well, it’s like anywhere else. There’s different kind of people. We just have to figure out how to get those groups to mix /it’s the same thing here I think /but, to a smaller degree because we’re a much bigger country /um / and we can /I don’t why we can deal with it better /I think it’s because there’s so many different cultures /but these cultures have been /there’s three cultures within one culture that have been battling for years /and we just have to figure out /nobody’s figured out a way /we still don’t know a way, but we have to figure it out somehow
[S9] And the thing is /I think that the /that the solution needs to come from within the actual country
[S11] Absolutely
[S9] And the U.S. just never really allows that to happen anywhere.
[S11] But, I think without some outside help /they’re never gonna get to it /because they’ve been at it for so long
[S9] Well outside help is /is necessary, but it /but they /it has to be help /it can’t be control
[S11] Right /No, I agree /I totally agree with you /um / it’s just /how are we gonna do it? /(cough) /sorry /how are we gonna do it? That’s the problem now.
[S10] That’s the next presidency’s problem /that’s the /which is gonna be to get out of there /so that’s gonna be your solution
[S11] But, I still don’t know if getting out /just pulling out is a solution /I don’t think it is
[S10] No, I’m not saying necessarily it’s what I would do either, but /like / that’s gonna be one of the main things you’re voting for on the next ballot /is what president is saying we’re leaving /one presidential candidate saying we’re leaving and the other one saying we’re not
[S11] Yeah, but it’s not that simple /that’s the whole problem /it’s not that
[S10] Oh, I completely agree.
[S11] But, a lot of the Americans /you know /not all of the American people /they go with the media /and the media is just like, oh another death in Iraq 
[S12] Yeah, but what’s different now though /especially like compared to say Vietnam or whatever it is /you have all these people coming over /coming back over /um /I guess it’s more /it’s similar to Vietnam in the way you have all these soldiers /um /GI’s and so forth /coming over saying, we gotta get out of there /they go in there fully supporting it from their home in /I don’t know, Tulsa /Ok / and they come back and their families that represented /you know /the flag on their lawn the entire time /they come back and they’re like, well we gotta get out of this war /you have /it’s the same thing /they’re not joining the necessarily Students for a Democratic Society and going /starting the Kent State massacre /but they’re going to a lower /to a lesser extent, there’s this returning soldier /um, you know /um syndrome right now of people that don’t /that don’t want to be over there /that don’t think it’s the right cause 
[S11] But, that’s not all of them though /it’s not even half /it’s just depends on the person’s experience
[S10] Um /well /I mean most of their experiences if they’re coming back /I mean / I think it’s either injury because they need everybody over there they can /I mean that’s the problem at this point /you have all these /your reserves /the reserves are /you know /your soldiers /and they’re not soldiers necessarily /they’re prison guard /which isn’t even their training /um /you know for /sorry /at uh /you know like [inaudible] /where there’s /you have to be prison guard for I guess /what they figure the most dangerous terrorists in Iraq and there the training was /you know /just general infantry /and they sat up in North Carolina for three years
[S9] I think one of the themes /biggest themes of this war is /um / the United States not being prepared
[S10] Sure, absolutely
[S9] I mean even now /I mean see in the newspapers /um /about the army hospitals, and how they’re just not equipped to deal with most of the brain injuries of the soldiers and things like that
[S11] But, can we trust the media we’re getting? Because it’s all spun. Even before it goes to political /from that /whichever station or whichever paper it is /it’s spun before that because it’s spun by our government
[S10] Well, just look at statistics and infer what you want.
[S11] Statistics you can lie with /very easily
[S10] Yeah, but you /you get broad /you’re getting all these broad ranges that are kinda similar /it’s not like the Holocaust where you go from six million to sixteen million /it’s like the numbers are all pretty similar
[S11] Still /I’m not saying the numbers even /it’s just can we really trust exactly what the media is telling us in exactly the way the media spins it? No matter how impartial we want to be, it’s gonna taint us. It’s gonna taint our opinions of it.
[S10] Absolutely, that’s just what you read in [inaudible] /right?
[S11] Yeah, well personally I don’t know /does anyone read the international papers? Like I read papers 
[S10] BBC
[S11] I watch BBC all the time /like that’s where /that’s where I get my news /I don’t read the New York Times anymore /I’ve given up /I’ve given up on the U.S.’s newspapers because you never know /you never know which political party, which person’s opinion you’re getting /it’s a little less impartial than an outside view /so can we really be /take what they’re saying and without taking it with a really huge grain of salt?
[I’m just gonna like jump in a little bit. Do you mind, just kinda give us what you have thought about the war or? Jump in on anything that has been kind of brought up.]
[S12] Well, regarding the war itself /um / I’m not really heavily opinionated either way, but I think that’s more of a lack of background knowledge /um /cause I mean I’ve seen the news reports and /um / I /friends of mine have lost relatives over seas, but the actual /um / specifics and /I know some general points of controversy, but outside of that /um / I’m pretty much listening and sort of learning some of the news stuff now /but one of the questions /well /that was brought up /um /would be how feasible it would be /or what should be done /um /in the future /and you discussed the coming presidency and what not, but what do you think could be done /um /potentially? /and how? /I don’t know if that’s too vague /or open-ended /I think so /[laughter] 
[S10] I mean I don’t have /if that’s towards me, I don’t have an answer for that /I think that’s why they’re gonna be elected /that’s why I’m not running for office
[S11] I think the main thing is we don’t have any better ideas right now /we don’t /we don’t know what to do because it’s /a situation that’s happened before and nobody’s been able to fix it yet /so this is what
[S10] See, I disagree/ I don’t think the situation has even happened
[S11] You don’t think /well not the exact same situation /I mean the situation with trying to fix war and culture in countries that have been warring for centuries
[S10] Ok
[S11] We had the same thing happening in Israel, and the same thing happening in 
[S9] Militarily  becoming militarily involved in the country and trying to [inaudible] their government /that has happened
[S11] That’s happened numerous times.
[S9] So many times /and I mean there hasn’t been a /you know /good way of handling it yet /you think they would just learn not to do it in the first place
[S11] Well, we know history /we know we don’t learn from history
[S9] Yeah
[S11] Sometimes, I think history is gonna come up behind people and just hit people with a bat and just, listen to what I tell you /sorry /it’s just /we don’t have any better ideas /we don’t know what to do, and I don’t think really anybody has any better ideas yet /it’s either say or pull out /there’s kind of no /even no middle ground
[S10] How long does it take to formulate an idea? Like eight years? Is that what it is? Is that what it’s gonna be?
[S11] I don’t know.
[S10] So, I mean if the best thinkers in our country can’t come to some kind of reasonable conclusion for occupation there or for prolonging of our occupation there, then they’re obviously /they shouldn’t be /ok
[S11] I don’t agree.
[S10] Cause you can’t, you can’t keep /you can’t keep people slowly but surely dying and losing their will to be in a place and the cause /the cause /there are people fighting now that when the war started were /probably had never /probably had very little idea where Iraq was because they were so young /cause they were /they were young high-schoolers
[S11] No, I absolutely agree with the fact that there shouldn’t be people who can’t order a beer in the states, but they can go die for their country /but that’s different /that’s totally different /they’re too young to be fighting for their country
[S10] Right, but we see /dude /those were the ones where /they would have previously gone to the reserves and so forth /that doesn’t happen, and with the cutting and funding to um /to um /oh what’s the type of school /uh high school /it’s like another branch of high school where you just do like engineering type things /um /skipping on the word right now, but they cut funding on that
[S11] Magnet schools?
[S10] No /uh
[S11] Vocational schools?
[S10] Vocational /vocational education /right /they cut funding /the Bush administration cut funding like significantly which also increased /um /the amount of /um applicants for the reserves because a lot of kids that are old enough to apply for that /instead of going to their two year program /they went to war /so it’s like everything is indirectly connected, but when they’re people /you cut funding to where you get lower income /um / student’s from like low income housing /or housing families /that need the certain education, but need to work at the same time /so, they can’t go to a four year /they go to a two year vocational school, but no, there’s no money for that /so they go in 
[S12] And, when did that take place?
[S10] Oh, that was like two years ago? Three years ago?
[S11] Three /three? I think it’s three.
[S10] And, it’s something like in middle /you know but
[S11] Umm, but here’s  my problem. Just /ok /you think if we really pull out that there just gonna fight with each other? Because they all have very strong views against /a lot of people in /have strong views against western culture, so you really think it’s just gonna stay with them fighting within their own cultures or it’s gonna spread /because I don’t think it’s gonna stay within their own cultures /I think they’re /it’s going to become a problem /it’s going to grow
[S10] Like, you mean other countries?
[S11] I think it’s gonna spread, I think it’s gonna /they’re gonna kind of /I don’t have /I’m not articulating well
[S10] Well, I don’t think you have to worry about like Iran and Iraq getting along at some /you know what I mean at 
[S11] But, here’s the thing /almost everybody has nuclear weapons now, right?
[S10] I don’t know.
[S11] One crackpot’s gonna /they have them /we know they have them
[S10] Iraq doesn’t apparently.
[S11] Apparently /we don’t know because we have no idea where they could be hidden /they could be hidden in other countries /we really don’t know /this is just /this isn’t something that’s in stone /this isn’t something that’s /I’m just saying in general /they’re/ just pulling out is gonna cause more problems /just leaving is gonna cause more problems than if we had never gone in, in the first place
[S10] It’s not just gonna like /here today and not here tomorrow /I mean it’s a gradual process, but if you’re gradually going to be adding more people there /you should at least /I mean why not gradually be taking people away /giving them more power of their country slowly but surely as opposed to just adding /just signing a bill where you add 10,000 more troops /you know what I’m saying?
[S11] No, I agree
[S10] It’s almost like, you’re gonna have to get the ball rolling in one direction and stay with it /and the direction of the ball /you know /it’s going /is more people, more time /as opposed to less people, less time /because otherwise, everything we’ve done there /I mean, it’s nothing because we’re supposed to be training /part of like the objective here was to /to train Iraqi forces /uh /you know /policemen, soldiers and so forth /to maintain their own country /like that’s what we had /the guy who came and spoke here /he was a former /the volleyball coach or cheerleading coach here /was part of a unit where trained a bunch of Iraqis /and he taught /they learned the ropes and the American soldier way and so forth, and they’re supposed to be the future of you know /of you know Iraq
[I’m just gonna throw it back to you guys for a little bit. Any input on what’s been brought up?]
[S12] Do you think that given enough time, that if we maintain an occupancy there /that we’d be eventually like facing a bottleneck and be forced out?
[S10] Yeah, I mean yeah I do /but that’s like a /that’s a couple years
[S9] At least that’s something that hasn’t been tried before /actually sticking with a country and staying in
[S11] Yeah
[S9] I mean /in most of the /in pretty much all of the other instances or similar situations the United States has gotten itself into /we’ve kind of just pulled out
[S11] Haiti /they pulled out and look what happened /it fell into complete anarchy
[S10] Haiti also /um /since the transatlantic slave trade has been /I mean went on /I mean it’s had its own issues, plus it has a civil war and
[S11] But, it’s the same kind of issue /and the pulling out /we didn’t stay with it and we caused more problems by leaving /by being there and then just not being there /we caused more problems
[S10] I would say there’s better examples in South America /that /where we placed people to make quick fixes /I mean /like um /Pinochet /didn’t the United States hand pick him a general there? The military /weren’t we like, oh that guy’s fine? He could be the /and Noriega was the same way until he got caught drugs and now he’s in prison in Miami or something like that /but that’s the whole prison of the United States /um
[S11] But, everyone makes mistakes /no one’s perfect. No government is perfect.
[S10] We just make a lot of them.
[S11] Everybody makes a lot of them. Look at history. I mean, come on.
[S9] I mean, even /well when we pulled out of Vietnam /that was /I mean evacuations were so sudden that a lot of people that got hurt were the people that were non-Americans but who were helping Americans /who they recruited to help /a lot of people from other Asian countries, and /um / I mean so /hasty pull out would definitely not be
[S10] Oh, I know /I mean I’m not
[S11] Well, when you say gradual, what do you mean? Like over the next ten years? Over the next fifteen years?
[S10] No, I mean over the next like /uh three to four /four to five /I mean if you stay there ten more years then /then you’ve been occupying another country for /how long we’ve been there? Was it 2000 and two? Three?
[S9] 2003
[S11] So, are you saying complete pull out with no one there, no bases, no nothing?
[S10] No, I mean we’re always gonna have military bases /we have military bases in every country I think we’ve ever been in a war /plus all the countries we haven’t /you know /we’re the United States /they have embassies in 
[S11] Everybody has embassies.
[S10] Right, but we have embassies and military bases in the Philippines /like Iraq is a place they need to have military bases in because of proximity next to Iran, proximity to Israel
[S11] Well, when people say pull out /they usually mean think completely
[S10] Well, no, pulling out of the situation they’re in /where they’re trying to help /you know /run a country or support a country
[S11] I think, I agree with you in that we need to stick with it /we can’t just /it seems like giving up on people if we just leave /it seems like we’re saying, it’s not gonna happen, it’s not gonna work so we’re just gonna leave and give up
[S9] And, one of the problems I have /I think /is that the popular view is so much just get out now
[S10] Well, well [inaudible]
[S9] And even in congress, the partisanship /like Democrats just you know /get out
[S10] But, Democrats won congress because of this more or less /because people wanted to see change and specifically in this field
[S9] Yeah
[S11] Well, I think almost 
[S9] That was the same people that wanted us to go in, in the first place.
[S10] Absolutely
[S11] Well, what you just said /also just made me think of something /it made me think, this is the problem we have with the two party system /there’s no middle area /it’s either stay or go out /it’s not /it’s stay for a while or go out now /there’s no middle ground
[S10] Well, it’s pretty /you can’t just float around in the middle for something like this
[S11] No, but you can do gradual /but she /I agree with what you’re saying /they’re saying, now /get out now /there’s not gradual, there’s no
[S9] Yeah
[S11] It’s now, they want them out now.
[S10] Yeah, but I think if they ever passed something /legislation /it wouldn’t be like the extraction of 20,000 troops /it would never say that /you know /it’d be like two thousand this month and 
[S11] Um /it happened in Vietnam. Why wouldn’t it happen again?
[S10] Um /Vietnam
[S11] And we know that people don’t learn from their mistakes.
[S10] Yeah, but Vietnam’s like totally different /it’s comp- /you can’t even compare Vietnam to Iraq
[S11] You can compare it because it’s 
[S10] Cause, cause /like Vietnam was first off, part of the containment policy which is like in itself the age old
[S11] Is it a war?
[S10] Was it a war?
[S11] Was it a war?
[S10] No, technically it was/ was Vietnam a war technically /was that
[S9] This isn’t a war either.
[S10] This isn’t a war either /right
[S11] But, they’re calling it the war on terror /so, it is a war even thought it hasn’t been declared
[S10] Yeah, but, terror isn’t a country.
[S9] They’re not declared wars /is what it is /but in all fairness, there are people /like you know in newspapers and media who do compare it to Vietnam
[S10] Well I mean /no /absolutely  /I mean people are always comparing things to Vietnam because people want to look at how poorly we’re doing /that doesn’t say people don’t want us out of there too
[S11] But, you know what? It’s not necessarily poor. It’s just /it’s a process /it’s just the beginning of it /not every experiment’s gonna show /not even experiment /experiment’s the wrong word /not everything that’s gonna happen is gonna show results automatically, right away /and when it comes to terms of countries and change /three years, four years, five years, is nothing /it’s no time
[S10] No, and I know /but, it’s a long time in the grand scheme /not in the grand scheme of things, but in the American perspective, which is the perspective that everybody that votes in this country looks at /and Britain looks at it /I’m sorry, Britain /and um /England, France, all those other countries that were /that were supporting us and were our allies in the beginning /and now they don’t 
[S9] Which is what is wrong with 
[S10] Well, they don’t because they see it as a lost cause and they’re like /they don’t want to have their country’s name associated with it any longer
[S11] There’s also the fear that they’re closer to it than they are /than we are /they came /it can become a home war for them
[S10] Hmm.
[S11] It absolutely could.
[S10] There’s no way that England or France is afraid that the Iraqis are gonna start to attack them. 
[S11] You’d be surprised at what the people /I personally have /my family lives over there /that’s
[S10] Ok.
[S11] You’d be surprised at what you hear from the people /not the governments /the people
[S10] They also have larger /I mean there are populations within France specifically /so even /that’s their own /that’s France’s own /um 
[S11] That’s their fear.
[S10] Yeah, that’s a like real xenophobic culture, and like that’s a problem /but at the same time /like / it’s also different because Europe obviously is different because the cities is where the more affluent people live and the outskirts /the suburbs are where more poverty is /it’s completely different than our country /so people in Paris /they’re not really as afraid as 
[S11] But, there’s also the different governments in Paris which actually subsidize the poor /you can get a house for free /same thing in Germany and France and in Italy /if you’re poor, you can get a house /they’ll give you one /it’s just different governments so I don’t know if we can really compare their opinions to our opinions because it is different /it’s completely different form of government
[S10] But, it matters. It matters /like a lot /what the foreign /the foreign perspective /especially, being those as our closest allies
[S9] See, and I think one of the mistakes that our government made was /um /invading without consent of the U.N.
[S11] Oh, absolutely.
[S10] Absolutely
[S9] And they just blatantly going against the U.N.’s orders /because the only way that the U.N. is actually gonna function /and you know /it doesn’t really function very well anymore /is
[S11] It never really functioned very well. The idea was nice.
[S9] Uh, yeah /but exactly /and the idea is that it’s the members that have to make it work by cooperation and things like that /and you know the U.S. was supposed to be this /you know /beacon of light or power or whatever /and 
[S11] I’m still not saying we should have gone in. I agree with you, we shouldn’t have gone in.
[S9] Oh no I was just
[S11] I mean great /it’s great that Saddam is out of power because he was /you know /a murderer /just in the simplest sense of the word /he was a murderer
[S10] Now correct me if I’m wrong, I believe I heard the statistic that in the four years /the four years we’ve been there /um /the amount of Iraqi casualties and injured has caught up like /some outrageous number from /from Saddam’s regime
[S11] I don’t know.
[S10] The only thing that he did do /and I’m not supporting dictators of any sort, but he /um /gave structure to their country /anarchy
[S11] But, the thing is /it was a structure that was based on killing /he was killing anyone that decided to [inaudible] him /so
[S10] Well /yeah /I know/ I’m not like, yo let’s kill em to make em serious
[S9] It’s just a fact, but then again /how do you /how do you pick and choose what dictators you’re gonna take out of power /you know?
[S10] No, you don’t /you don’t /and we put them in power, so 
[S11] No, I agree. I’m just saying in general, I’m glad that he’s out of power. Maybe, we didn’t go about it the right way /we definitely didn’t go about it the right way, but he’s out of power /and that is a good thing
[S10] But, didn’t you find anything wrong with the fact that like we went in there /um / because of weapons of mass destruction
[S11] Absolutely /no absolutely /I don’t think we went in for the right reasons /that’s what I’m saying
[S10] Ok /yeah /ok
[S11] We did not go in for the right reasons.
[S10] I don’t think we’re as far apart.
[S11] What?
[S10] I think we’re just differing on the whole leaving
[S11] No, I agree. I agree. Um /and I think there’s definitely /when it comes to people’s /when polled /it’s all black and white /and it’s not because
[S10] Oh, sure /its people
[S9] Polls themselves aren’t even that reliable.
[S11] No, I know. I mean it’s /that’s the problem /the majority of America listens to what they’re
[S9] And that’s why /well that’s one of the reasons that /you know /our country formed the government that it did /was to control the media against popular whims and things like that
[S11] Well, it’s absolutely /it doesn’t though /it doesn’t work that way
[S9] No
[S11] But, I mean /I think there’s definitely a /I think part of this is because there’s such a big population of people who live in a certain kind of area and a certain kind of mindset /because our country’s so big /everyone’s so spread out, and then there’s that /you have the coasts that are really densely populated, and then in the middle it’s all kind of rural /very rural, very few cities /and there’s a certain kind of mindset, and that is who rules our country /almost /that’s who /that /the majority of votes are in the Midwest region
[Can I just jump in again? Do you have any thoughts on like what she’s saying or just /or even anything that’s been said previously?]
[S12] Um / this is actually just following along /um / just listening /in terms of again /sounds like such a cop out /but um /in terms of the war, I am not for or against /but in terms of the pulling out /I do agree that it is a good idea /and that it could be achieved gradually /in terms of the historical examples that /Haiti and South America and what not /that’s sort of new to me /because I’m /yeah /I’m [inaudible]
[S11] Math and science.
[S12] Yes
[Laughter]
[S10] This is /next topic
[Laughter]
[Well, ok /do you have anything else to say?]
[Laughter]
[S12] Um 
[S11] Do you think we went in for the right reasons?
[S12] The reason being given was weapons of mass destruction, and clearly that didn’t prove to be accurate /so I wouldn’t say that we did
[S9] And I think also /like /you said before /it’s /uh /you know /called it /well first what /first it was operation Iraqi freedom, isn’t that what it was called?
[S11] Well, first we were in Afghanistan /then somehow we ended up in Iraq.
[S10] It’s cause /it’s cause /I mean /it’s cause it was unfinished business from the Secretary of Defense and /and the first Bush’s administration /Chaney /the Vice President /I don’t know /there’s all kinds of
[S11] See, this is the /see, this is the problem with that
[S10] And that’s why a lot of people blame Chaney
[S11] We can’t blame any single person. We can’t /we can’t blame one person /which /it’s just not possible because it just doesn’t work /that’s not the way our government functions
[S10] Obviously
[S9] But I think you can make the argument that what happened with Bush’s father is on President Bush’s mind when he’s making this decision.
[S10] Absolutely
[S11] I can see that, but I don’t think it’s his
[S9] I mean I think you can make the argument.
[S11] You can, but I don’t think it’s his driving force /I would personally /think about it /if you went /if his father was president and then you became president /you’d want to separate yourself from him /not be him
[S10] Yeah, but that’s what we’re saying /it’s not /I’m saying /um 
[S9] And in going after him, he’s separating himself from him because he’s doing something that his father couldn’t accomplish.
[S10] Right, exactly /and Chaney was not slapped in the face because Desert Storm was much more successful than this has been /but at the same time Desert Storm didn’t take Saddam Hussein out of power, which was [inaudible]
[S11] Which was its aim.
[S10] But, it was shorter.
[S11] I mean, there’s good things that came from this war in the fact that Saddam Hussein is out of power /right /that is a good thing /are we kinda like /that’s not
[S10] No, I agree with you.
[S11] Dictator /gone /people not getting slaughtered because they believe in a different /they worship a god a different way /good thing /you know /but then they /we’re still at war for reasons that we shouldn’t be, but I’m still standing by the fact that we can’t /until there’s a better idea /until there’s a better plan, we can’t just leave /we can’t just leave it the way it is because that’s a cop out /it’s just leaving /it’s giving up on people /and I don’t know /I’m a humanist /I believe that all people are generally good, and there’s some way we can do this /it can be done 
[Ok]
