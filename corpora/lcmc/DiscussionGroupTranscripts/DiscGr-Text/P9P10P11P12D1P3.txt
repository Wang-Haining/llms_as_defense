GROUP 9101112
PRIVACY RIGHTS
[Ok, is everyone ready to begin? Alright. Recently school officials prevented a school shooting because one of the school shooters posted a Myspace bulletin. Do you think that that was an invasion of privacy?]
[S11] They put it on the internet.
[S10] Right
[S11] It’s public /the internet is a public place, it’s just as public as saying something in the middle of the street. Put it out there to be seen.
[S10] I think I’ve written down the same comment for this ten times /at least
[S11] Same here
[S10] I hate this topic, I’m sorry /I’m just gonna throw that out in the beginning of this, but
[S11] Why?
[S10 Cause I just think it’s stupid /like we’re talking about all these really like important controversial issues, and like freedom of speech obviously is important
[S11] But, we can bring it into tapping phones /it’s the same kind of thing
[S10] Yeah
[S9] Well
[S10] Phone conversations are a lot more private than 
[S11] Umm /I have had
[S10] Well, inherently they are more private than Myspace /you put stuff on Myspace for people to see, but you don’t
[S11] Yeah, but what about /you never know
[S9] Whereas you actually /you know /you sign an agreement /you know for Myspace
[S11] Same thing with internet /well you do the same thing with the phone companies /but, it’s still public /you’re putting it out there /it’s still public /same thing with IM’s /like I don’t talk on the phone /so I’ve had more important conversations through Myspace, through things like messages on Facebook and email and IM’s /and personally I know that if I’m putting something onto the internet /somebody’s gonna see it /it’s also saved on my hard drive /no matter how many times I try to wipe it /and somebody that knows how to do it /they can hack in and see anything, and they can do the same thing with the phones /so how do you differentiate between what’s public and what’s not?
[S10] Well /that /that’s like all /um / I think I’m thinking about this more in terms of like if you’re doing controversial things /if you’re having /you’re calling somebody to plan a /to plan a attack /to plan a terrorist attack or /and you’re also posting it on your Myspace
[S11] Which is stupidity, but
[S10] Right, but you know what I’m saying /like the Myspace you have to watch very carefully /what you put on there if you don’t know that everybody’s gonna be looking at it /but you’re putting stuff on there so people do look at it /but, when you call your mom or your dad to tell him you got a bad grade
[S11] It’s still public air waves, right?
[S10] I mean, it shouldn’t be /you’re calling your mom or your dad /you’re not calling /um /the rest of the people in the world to tell them to look at your site
[S11] What about the phone tapping that happened after 9-11?
[S9] Well, here’s the question, well this specific topic at least involves school officials looking at Myspace web pages /now can /is it acceptable for school officials to tap kids’ phones?
[S11] School lines or personal ones? Not our cell phones, but the school owns our room phones.
[S10] I live off campus.
[S11] Ok, that’s 
[S10] I’m above the school already /like
[S11] I never use my room phone, but I’m saying /just in general /they own them /they have the right /we give our rights away /when we come here /it’s a private institution /we give our rights away at the door. They can do anything they want. 
[S9] I was /was thinking of high school /like home phones
[S11] Same thing though /mmm
[S10] That’s a private /that’s your house
[S11] I wouldn’t say home phones in high school
[S9] Cause let’s say /I mean I don’t know how they /uh / if this /well /I mean if the student’s doing it from a computer, you know when they’re home /you know posting this Myspace or whatever/[inaudible] /can they tape their phones?
[S11] Well, just in general, do you think the internet is public? I mean anything you put on the internet /I /it’s not just email /I mean it’s not just emails /Facebook, Myspace, Flicker /whatever you want to say
[S10] Mmhmm.
[S11] Xanga /whatever it is /it’s all public /Internet Explorer, MSN
[S9] Yeah, anyone can
[S10] Yup
[S11] Somebody who has five minutes of a hacking course can access your IM’s and your emails from your last /you know /four years /um / so that’s public, right?
[S9] Yeah
[S10] Mmhmm.
[S11] So, is it right that they get /like ok /maybe not the school shooting /right? /but, a girl from my high school got expelled for having a picture on her Myspace of her drinking
[S9] Expelled?
[S11] I went to an all-girls, Catholic high school
[S9] That’s /I went /I went to an all-girls, Catholic high-school too and there was this similar situation in that /the girl’s um /which was stupid of them, but they were looking at these photos on a school computer
[S11] Mmhmm.
[S9] On someone’s Myspace /and it was pictures of /you know /some of the girls drinking /and, um /uh /and so the school can access all the websites that you go to on the school computer /and so the principal saw this /and I can’t believe they actually expelled the girl /but, they just /they just called the parents and told them about it
[S11] It was a long situation because there was a group /they did a Myspace group called the Villa Gorillas /I went to /we were the Villa Gorillas
[S9] What school did you go to?
[S11] St. John Villa Academy High School /for girls /if you do track, you know us /other than that, probably not /cause we were the only sport that mattered
[Laughter]
[S11] All I have to say right now /um /no, but /so /there was a picture of the principal on the group /and that’s how they found her Myspace /she did nothing on the school computer’s, but there’s pictures of her /basically when she came /what they said was when she came into Villa she was representing Villa, and what she was putting out in public was not what they /was against what Villa was about /and she was given a chance to take it down and she wouldn’t because she said it’s public and it’s mine /it’s really not hers because she’s putting it out there first /but on another term from that, what about employers? Because employers now look at Myspace and Facebook /they look at Facebook now
[S10] At our school /uh, here /the athletic director /um, Joe Boyland /has a Facebook account, and he looks at all of our pictures /you can get in a lot of trouble if he sees anything like people smoking or drinking if their not 21 /you know /so like /they do /it happens here /like just as 
[S11] But, I’m not saying school officials /employers /completely different situation
[S10] These kids here
[S9] The [inaudible] look at it
[S11] Do they? That’s what I’m saying.
[S10] Well, this is the same thing as an employer because a lot of kids here that can get checked by the athletic director are making /uh / 35,000 dollars a year /technically
[S11] Really?
[S10] Oh, yeah /cause they’re going to Loyola which is 42,000 dollars a year /for like six, seven thousand dollars /it’s called their scholarship
[S11] Uh huh /love sports
[S10] Right /so those kids can lose lots and lots of money because they’re taking a beer pong and Boyland has a Facebook account /and um /sees them
[S11] Ok, same thing /ok
[S9] Same thing
[S12] Well /um / my chem. Professor started class one day by saying
[S10] What’s your Professor’s name?
[S12] Uh, Bill Hare
[S10] How old is he?
[S12] Um, I don’t know /my guess would be almost fifty based on what
[S10] Oh, one of the chem. professors here came over to have dinner with us /he was a very out there guy
[S11] Dr. Moore?
[S10] I don’t know, I don’t remember his name.
[S12] Was it [inaudible]?
[S10] Yeah, that’s gotta be it.
[S12] The guy who meows and stuff?
[S10] Yes, he does.
[S11] Dr. Moore is so cool /sorry 
[S10] Sorry about that /off the record
[Laughter]
[S12] Uh, well /Dr Hare /he started class by just saying like that he was shocked by a lot of stuff that he saw of people /cause he made a Facebook /and um /it’s still there /and well a lot of the kids in the class were freaking out as he was saying this cause they’re like, wait what do I have one there? /um /like /it was just really new to them, and this is sort of on a tangent /but, um another question to consider is to what extreme /um should we go /or kind of vague, but for example there was /I think she was 14 /um a girl who posted uh /something inflammatory about President Bush on her Myspace /and F.B.I. agents actually showed up at her school because of that
[S11] They have more things they should be worrying about /first of all
[S9] What /do you have any idea
[S11] What she said?
[S9] What she exactly said?
[S12] I don’t remember. I think it was something like actually about killing him.
[S11] Well, they do searches for specific phrases and words /they just do sweeps
[S12] Mmhmm.
[S11] Um /and I could see where that would come in
[S9] I mean that has to be considered because that’s probably what the situation is like /the example with /you know /preventing a school shooting is probably the same thing as I’m going to go kill someone /so you have to investigate that I think
[S11] I mean, if it’s just something inflammatory like I hate Bush or I hate what’s going on with our government or I hate what’s going on with this war
[S9] Then you’d have like an F.B.I. official at every house in America.
[Laughter]
[S11] Every liberal house in America /or not in every liberal house /every college house /um, but
[S9] Sorry, you were doing that
[S11] No, I lost /you know how you’re brain is just going and then shhh, that’s what happened /so it’s not your fault /um 
[S12] Inflammatory is probably backward.
[S11] Cause there’s the threat and then there’s inflammatory.
[S12] Right
[S11] And it sounds like what that was wasn’t a threat. To give you an example, I applied for a job /um /in the city /uh last /oh, for Christmas /and my employer looked at my Myspace /she put my name in to Google /she Googled me /and my Myspace came up /now I have a picture /I do um pole dancing for exercising /cause I don’t know if you’ve guys heard of /it’s ridiculous
[S9] Yeah
[S11] Like ridiculous exercise
[S10] Like what the strippers do?
[S11] No, I /yes, but it’s not
[S10] Ok
[S11] I’m wearing gym clothes.
[S10] Just trying to understand what you’re talking about.
[S11] It’s /you have /it’s basically you’re lifting your entire body weight with your arms /I lost twenty pounds in a week and a half /it’s insane, and my muscles were ridiculous /I just /but, my employer saw the picture and she goes /she wanted to ask me about it /and first /my first thought was oh shit /what she ended up asking was where did I go to do it, but do they have that right to question you about what you put on there?
[S9] Well, yeah /its public information /I mean 
[S10] Yeah, I mean you represent your company or whatever /your school
[S11] Well, no /I agree /but like so /it’s the same thing /did they have the right to expel her for having a picture of her with a bottle of beer /she was in Mexico, so technically where she was /she was legal /but, she had the picture on there and she wasn’t [inaudible]
[S10] That’s acceptable, right?
[S11] She got /she still got expelled /so
[S9] I’m curious, what did /uh / did she /her family take any kind of action against the school?
[S10] They were going to, but then I don’t know what happened /they didn’t /so I’m not friends with the girl personally /um /and it happened right after I graduated /so I / I know / I went to school /I talked to my principal /I know the story from a nun, so I don’t know which twist I’m getting, but like still /the point of the matter is /they expelled her for something that seems like a minor infraction, but when it comes to the Myspace situation with the shooting /it seems like it’s a good thing /so almost /it’s kind of like a double-edged sword kind of thing with the privacy /it’s really /I mean how much privacy is there really in America or in the world? /nowadays anyway
[S9] Well /really in a school you know /privacy really isn’t a very important thing /the important thing is /you know /education and safety
[S10] You actually preach more community /you know than
[S11] Community and privacy are two different things though /you know /you can have community and have privacy
[S10] Yeah, but we go to a 3,300 kid school /you see the same people all the time /everybody knows each other /privacy here is just not an option in general
[S11] I think /well I don’t agree with that
[S10] I mean listen like /I know, listen /like obviously there’s Penn State and then there’s Loyola 
[S11] I think more 
[S10] You know everyone in your class too, you just have more of like a high school /you know the kids in your class /you’ve spoken to them /I mean there’s many classes at many universities where you don’t even talk
[S11] And I’ve seen you around campus before /I haven’t see you guys at least that I remember /I remember her hair so
[Laughter] 
[S11] Sorry, I love red hair /so it’s not you /I’m jealous of you /so that’s all
[S10] So it is you.
[S11] Well, it is you, but it’s not you. But, what I’m thinking is what’s more important, safety or privacy?  I mean big brother’s watching in our day and age /I don’t think /he really is
[S9] I think at least in terms of a school, safety is more important /in my opinion
[S11] Well, what about when it comes to /let’s completely don’t think about school /what’s more important your safety or your privacy? Should the government be able to look into what you have /like technically if the can look at your Myspace and technically the government has enough talent people that can hack your computer like that /if they see one thing on your Myspace that tweaks their interest or a blog or on something /they can hack
[S9] Well there the question is what’s private again /you know /cause that’s not private
[S11] Your computer’s not private. So, I’m saying if they see one phrase that makes them think /hmm, I wonder /they can technically /they have the power 
[S9] You’re talking about the internet?
[S11] I’m talking about your computer /you put one thing on the internet and that tweaks their interest /they can without talking to you /technically, it’s illegal, but they can do it anyway /and we all know that not everything that happens with the government is completely legal /um /they can hack your computer like that /they can look at all your files /anything
[S9] Was there some kind of warrant for that, to, to
[S11] Technically, they would have to have it, but they wouldn’t have to talk to you for them to get them for it /the could get it without speaking to you and you wouldn’t even know it
[S9] I mean / well but I mean /that’s kind of like searching someone’s house too /they don’t need their permission as long as they have a warrant
[S11] They have to be present. Someone has to be present. When it comes to this, you don’t even have to know because they can go into your computer and not even leave a trace.
[S9] Well
[S12] What happens when /oh I’m sorry
[S9] No, no /please
[S12] Like, what if a point of privacy is a point of safety /like I’m not saying that an employer or like an admissions officer would have access to it, but say /um / you had your social security number or something encrypted /um /but, it was there /um / how much /well say like government or what not /or people in the government /how much um /lee-way /how much ability I guess /do you think they should be allowed into that sort of data /if it’s alongside other more casual stuff that they would check
[S11] Personally, I’m one for when it comes to certain things /when it comes to /unless there’s an army knocking down my door /let me deal with my own safety /just give me my privacy /that’s my view /I want my privacy, I’m a very /when it comes to things that I want to keep to myself, I keep them to myself /I mean obviously I’m very opinionated and I speak my mind, but there are things that I keep to myself that I wouldn’t want anybody to know /and I personally write on my computer /I write better on my computer /my ideas flow better /I have a journal on my computer /I have things that I would never want anybody else to read /so, who gives anybody that right to come onto my computer? You know? Cause to me that’s a breach of privacy that’s as bad as somebody searching my house. 
[S9] I mean, I think /same thing with searching the house /if there’s a legitimate suspicion for it and they do get some sort of warrant for it, then it’s acceptable /but, I think that they should know about it /the same rules should apply to a situation like searching someone’s house
[S11] Do you all just see what I’m saying though in that I’d rather deal with my own safety.
[S9] No, I do. 
[S11] I’d rather have my own privacy. Which, a lot of people think that I’m crazy, and that I really don’t understand what I’m saying, but 
[S9] I understand, but then also /just I mean to talk about this specific topic of the school /I think that safety is more important than privacy
[S11] I think I agree with you. When it comes to things that /I literally /when it’s on the internet, it’s public information, but if it’s on /if it’s not on the internet /they /you’re computer can be connected to the internet, but it’s on your computer /it’s not been put out there for others to see /that’s private /there’s a block there
[S9] Well, yeah.
[S11] So
[So where do you guys think the line should be drawn, as to whether or not other school officials are invading our privacy or the government is invading your privacy?]
[S11] When I think privacy issues, I think the phone tap after 9-11 /that’s my automatic thought /I don’t think about the internet because that’s public information, but do /if there’s even an iota of suspicion, should they be able to tap our phones?
[S9] I think
[S12] If it’s legitimate 
[S11] But who decides that?
[S9] I think it needs to be sanctioned by like a court order.
[S11] Who decides /but, that’s the problem /the problem is it’s too objective /who decides? /like who decides who we tap /who decides what’s a legitimate reason?
[S9] Well, usually the courts
[S11] There’s no real standards is what I’m saying.
[S9] Well, I guess the courts don’t establish a standard, kind of like they, they
[S11] There still isn’t really a standard for when it comes to search warrants /it’s up to the judge
[S9] Then I guess that’s the way it is for that. I guess that’s the way it should be for /unless someone can think of something better
[S11] So is that /is that a good system or should it be fixed? /like personally I think there’s a problem with it /that it needs to be fixed /there needs to be a standard because somebody can /one judge can say you can search this house because you heard him say that he hates Bush and then another judge can say, well just because you heard him say that he has a cache of guns /you can’t search his house because it’s not a real reason /like it’s all obj- /it’s subjective
[S9] I know, but I think /the things about the problem is you can’t really standardize like individual /it’s never gonna be standardized because individual cases are so different
[S11] Well we have standardized testing /everybody’s so different /like this is a totally different situation, but in general it’s the whole individual versus standardized thing /you can’t really /you have to have a standard /you have to have
[S12] Just a quick response to that /there’s still debate about standardized testing in general
[S11] Oh, I know /I know I’m just
[S12] I’m sorry.
[S11] I’m just giving an example to show like the whole difference, like there is a standard /there has to be a cut-off point where /yes, a search warrant is automatically needed no matter who judges /if this person was overheard or this person was seen with something /that like when it comes to /there has to  be a cut-off point
[S9] I mean I don’t think the government and the executive branch by itself has the right to tap people’s phones.
[S11] Oh, I agree.
[S9] Right. 
[S11] I’m not saying its right, I’m just kid of playing the devil’s advocate here. Um, to get things rolling /um I don’t know
[S9] I mean in terms of /I don’t know /in terms of schools like /I know people /I think it was my junior year /we had a lock down drill and the school brought in cops and dogs to sniff out drugs in people’s lockers 
[S11] Oh, dear me.
[S9] I mean, and you know a lot /I mean a lot of people complained about that and were angry about that, but I thought about it /and it’s school property /I mean the school has the right to do whatever really /search whatever /it’s school property /the locker isn’t your property, it’s the school’s property /and so 
[S11] Well, here’s the difference, when you go to a school that’s a private institution /you’re /you check your rights at the door, but when you come into this country, you don’t / when you come into this country, you get your rights /so /do they have the same rights as a school does?
[S10] Are you saying public schools?
[S11] Public and private /they’re still 
[S10] You all aren’t saying the same thing then.
[S11] Well, yeah it’s the same thing because like the locker /it’s all public property at the school /the school /at catholic school /you check your rights at the door when you go to that school because they’re admitting you /you have to go by their rules /that’s why their allowed to punish you /detention, etcetera, etcetera
[S10] Mmhmm /Well, I guess if school’s teachers and principals and guidance counselors and everything /they invest a lot of their time and who they are /you know /into the students, and they want /if students upbringing is gonna be dependent on these different administrative individuals /then, um who is to say that it shouldn’t /that it is Ok then, right? /for them to want to check up and make sure that they’re on the right path /it’s almost like it’s just another way of /I mean, and if they’re doing something inherently bad /you know and they find out /it’s also their responsibility to make sure that kid doesn’t do that and get in trouble and go down the wrong path
[S11] Oh no, I agree with you.
[S10] And do the wrong thing /so I think /I guess it’s Ok to have a level /um a certain amount of inspection and, and, and less privacy /I guess
[S11] I think, when it comes to schools, you have no rights because you checked your rights at the door /you’ve given them /you’ve given yourself over to them /what I’m saying is you don’t do that when you come into our country
[S12] Ok, I get that.
[S11] You don’t give up your rights, so how does that
[S10] No, I agree.
[S11] Government /like it’s kind of a paradox
[S9] Unless, unless you give /unless you give the government reason /uh
[S11] To take away your rights
[S9] To take away your rights, which once again I think comes down to with what we were talking about with warrants and things like that.
[S11] It’s all kind of intertwined /kind of mushed all together /you can’t really separate it /it’s all you know /I don’t know /I’m kind of like losing articulation
[S10] I’ve been at Loyola since ten, I kind of want to go home. 
[S11] I've been up since six /don’t know why I went for a run before my eight a.m. class /that was stupid
[Anyone just wanna like give their final thoughts on this topic?]
[S9] What was the original question?
[Laughter]
[The original question was about the Myspace bulletin, and the shooter, and posting that and getting in trouble for it, and where should the school officials draw the line as to what /where should the line be drawn as to whether they are invading privacy?]
[S11] I don’t think there is really a line cause when it comes to that /it’s you give up your rights when you come to school /you have to obey by their rules /and, you know /a school shooting is definitely outside the rules
[S9] Yeah /I mean internet /public space /school officials, part of the public
[S11] Talking in school /public space /you know /if he was /if the kid was overheard or /I don’t know /honestly do we even know if the Myspace /if the school officials found it or if he was reported by somebody else? We don’t know and you know /informants /it’s also an invasion of privacy, but those are your friends /so
[S12] In the interest of everyone’s well-being /that might just have to be put to the side
[S11] Well, here’s the other problem /you can’t look at bulletins unless you’re somebody’s friend /you don’t see their bulletins /do you guys have Myspace?
[S12] Yeah
[S9] No
[S11] You do?
[S12] I do.
[S10] No
[S11] You do? Right /you have to be somebody’s friend /you don’t get bulletins from them unless you’re a friend /you don’t just see it on their profile /so it either had to be a blog post or somebody turned them in /so really there’s no question of privacy because they told somebody that /they told their friends, and their friends turned them in /there’s really no question of privacy because the school officials really didn’t have anything to do with it there /because also the blogs you have to be friends most of the time to read them
[S12] Can you adjust that?
[S11] You can, but not with the bulletins.
[S12] Ok
[S11] And, if it was a bulletin, which is what she said /only the people on your friend’s list can see it /so kinda takes the whole /I mean there’s difference between like /you can write a Facebook and, but then again there’s the security on Facebook /like only people that can see my page are my friends /if you’re not my friend /no matter if you’re in my network or not, you can’t even search for me /my friend Tess did it last night /she went to high school with me, so we’re both /you know /in the same network /and she searched for me, and some girl in another state came up /and the only Valerie Hart in the U.S. /and she’s like well you exist, and you’re on Facebook /but she even looked through our mutual friends /who I’m friends with on Facebook list /and I’m not on there /so you can tweak your security settings so people can’t find you
[S9] Yeah
[S11] So, where does the privacy end? /because you can put layers and layers and layers and layers on
[S10] That’s like the whole /isn’t that what makes like Facebook the /Myspace /like completely ridiculous /like interaction and /and privacy /like you subscribe and throw that out the door when you sign up to those things
[S11] Personally, I have it for one reason /one reason only /to keep people from /to find classmates if I need to
[S10] Sure, and everybody has different needs for it, but it’s completely like /like revolutionized college
[S11] Oh, absolutely.
[S10] I mean, I don’t know like what it was like /um because like when I was /um I guess a freshman /was the first time that Facebook came out
[S11] Last year or the year before?
[S10] I’m a junior here.
[S11] Ok /yeah /that’s the first year it came out
[S10] So, like I’m the first class of completely Facebook
[S11] It’s also completely different now than it was then /because
[S10] Oh absolutely /I
[S11] And completely different than it was last year /or you guys freshman or?
[S9] Freshman
[S11] Freshman, or you a freshman?
[S12] Yeah
[S11] See, I’m a sophomore. Last year was completely different /you couldn’t be on Facebook unless you were in college, and then high school was over the summer
[S10] Right, right
[S11] And then /now it’s open to everybody
[S10] Yeah
[S11] And, it’s /it was a lot safer /I think it was a lot safer before
[S10] Sure /well, it served more of a direct purpose /now, I mean /I mean now it’s kind of like a 
[S11] Now it’s like Myspace.
[S10] Yeah, it is.
[S11] And honestly, the only reason I have Myspace is because my cousins in Germany don’t have Facebook.
[S10] I think that’s the next step, so /I’m assuming that’s the next step
[S11] I’m assuming /I think so /yeah
[S10] I mean I /God, I hate /at first I /I mean I have uh /a Facebook account per say, but like it was like /it was almost like a slap in the face to what /what is college /you go from where you were comfortable to not /and you knew everybody .to going to a spot where you have to go up to somebody and like meet them
[S11] And then change
[S10] You get these groups like Loyola 2009 or 2008 or whatever and you have faces and you know what they like and 
[S11] But you’ve never met them
[S10] But you’ve never met them /yeah there’s no interaction
[S11] Which is scary
[S10] It’s completely just changed.
[S11] I mean honestly /I think I don’t know anybody /I know everybody and I know everybody on Facebook who’s on my friends list /I don’t know you /you aren’t on my friends list because
[S9] I know /I get people from my old high school who I never talk to a day in my life like trying to friend me
[S11] No, the scary part was I /um /I got messaged from this guy who I hadn’t seen in eight years /I got friended, and I was like whoa /somebody can find me that easy /that scares me /like I’m not even listed in the phonebook cause I’m like /I don’t like if I don’t want you to find me /if I want you to find me, I’ll give you my number /that scared me /I don’t like to be found that easy /it’s just like creepy almost /because it completely changed our culture /the internet in general completely changed our culture, but I mean how many people now talk on the phone every night? /like it used to be you gab on the phone to your girlfriends or your guy friends /or not really guy friends
[S10] I mean we pillow talk all the time.
[Laughter]
[S11] But like /like you know what I’m saying? In high school, we called our friends /not me because I got home at midnight, but /track /but, you know you don’t do that anymore /now you just turn on a computer and you talk to eight different people at one time
[S9] Oh, I can’t do that. I can only do two.
[S11] I think my record was /no I think my record was twenty boxes open at once because I was doing three different group projects /and then I was talking to my cousins, and my brother, and my Mom /have you ever instant messaged with your parents because it’s frickin hysterical
[S9] No, they can’t do it.
[S11] It’s funny /my Mom writes like whole paragraphs 
[S9] My grandma does that actually /my grandma has a screen name
[S11] I mean it’s a generational thing/ that we’re worried about privacy so much /because did our parents have to worry about it? I mean our Mom’s had to be worried about their diary being read by others /we have to worry about our diary being read by the entire world /just a thought
[Alright, I think we can stop.]
