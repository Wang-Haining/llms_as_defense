PRIVACY RIGHTS
[Recently school officials prevented a school shooting because one of the shooters posted a Myspace bulletin. Do you think that this was an invasion of privacy?]

[S22] The internet is the public domain. 

[S24] You’re right.

[S23] Who thought that their Myspace bulletin was private?
[Laughter] 
[S24] You put information out on the internet and it’s not / emails / something that’s purposefully secured
[S22] Yea
[S24] You’re asking people to look at it
[S23] No / no / I want to know who the dufus was who posted a bulletin to all his friends / on Myspace / cause everyone you’re friends with / reads those
[S22] Yea
[S23] And then / said / no / no / those were my private words
[S22] It definitely / doesn’t / doesn’t exceed / a reasonable expectation of privacy / if it’s in a public forum / and if it’s in something that is notably a public forum 
[S23] Seriously
[S22] It’s not like an email / or / like / if they tapped his instant messages / which would be just as easy, if not easier for them to do
[S23] Yea
[S22] That would probably be a little bit different if they didn’t have a warrant or anything / but like / I don’t know / I know the local police when they get scared they hire people to just go through all the kids Myspaces / and / check them out / and make sure they’re not crazy
[S24] They pay the staff to understand the / their intent / and the way their message being sent / especially with this age where technology is growing / you have to understand / ya know / maybe / you’re within your company and you’re within / um / a secured network behind firewalls and they’re not supposed to see it 
[S21] Yea
[S24] But if you’re just out on the internet / Myspace / um / Facebook / even if it’s something that’s kinda hidden from the general public / but I could just get a membership to it 
[S23] Yea
[S24] It’s still right out there in the open
[S21] Uh-huh
[S23] I mean / and you add so many / I mean / like / these 13 year old kids have friends lists like 1000 people long
[S21] Right
[S23] When / not even 1000 people go to their school / they can’t possibly be friends with all those people
[S21] Right
[S23] I mean / who knows who’s looking at your bulletins
[S21] Like that Tila Tequila girl / or whatever / she had 1 million friends
[S23] Really? [Laughter] / Who does that?
[S21] On Facebook / she’s famous now
[S23] Oh my gosh / that’s so silly
[S21] And she’s expecting like / people would expect things to be private? / With 1 million friends / friends
[S23] When you’re friends with like all of America
[S21] Yea / [Laughter]
[S23] There’s probably like 3 police detectives who are looking for pedophiles/ [Laughter]
[S21] Yea / it’s not as private as like a phone call or something 
[S23] Right
[S21] Like / that’s totally different
[S23] It’s not the same thing at all
[S22] That kid’s reasonable expectation of privacy does not outweigh his classmates’ reasonable expectation of safety
[S21] Right
[S23] Seriously / I mean / even if he like / that’s like posting / I’m going to bring a gun into school like on the blackboard / in class
[S21] A death threat / uh-huh
[S22] But by the same token / I / I think it’s also very important / um / and / I don’t know if this is always the way that it goes down / especially at the federal investigation level / but / um / I figured it was equally important that if it is a private forum / that / um / that warrants are just a very important concept / and / the whole process of getting a judges approval before you can invade what people / ya know / constitutionally / they have a reasonable expectation of privacy / so before an investigation can invade that / like / I think it’s good / it’s very valuable to have a judge be the last line of defense / but / that’s not public forums like Myspace and the Facebook 
[S21] Yea
[S22] Ya know
[S23] That should definitely be important / like / for invading something like instant messaging
[S22] Yea
[S23] Or email / then that’s definitely / steps you need to go through / cause that’s like tapping someone’s phone pretty much
[S21] Right
[S23] I mean / that’s to a specific audience you’re saying something / but / yea
[S22] How about / um / how about that show / on tv / where they lure in sexual predators into the house
[S21] Oh / um 
[S23] What?
[S24] Dateline
[S22] Yea
[S23] Really?
[S22] Yea / Dateline
[S24] Family Guy did that too.
[Laughter]
[S22] Yea / yea / that’s it / they / um / they lure like / they have someone go online and pose as like prey or whatever and they lure someone in to like coming to the house / who thinks they’re gonna have like sex with a kid / or whatever / and then / the just swamp him with cameras and police / and everything
[S23] Oh my G-d
[S22] And they just watch them like cry
[S23] Oh 
[S22] And they edit all these things together / cause it’s entertaining to watch / but / like / do you think that’s entrapment / or do you think that’s / that’s cool / or / are they just sickos that need to get off the street anyways?
[S21] Sickos that need to get off the streets anyways
[S24] That’s the risk you take / you never know who’s on the other end of that / and if you’re taking a risk thinking it’s a 13 year old boy
[S22] True
[S24] He could be a cop too / that’s your own fault
[S22] True
[S24] I mean / the guy / that just goes back to the sender / they should know / what they’re sending / how their / how their message is going across
[S23] Yea / that’s true / I mean / half the time / they’re pretending to be someone else anyhow
[S24] Right / exactly
[S23] If you’re trying to lure in a little boy
[S22] Could you say the cops are egging it on?
[S23] What?
[S22] Could you say that the cops are really egging it on?
[S24] No more so than that guy is / trying to egg on that child
[S23] Probably / yea 
[S22] Exactly / but if it wasn’t for both sides he wouldn’t have been in the house to begin with
[S23] Well / I think that’s a little extreme / I mean / I’ve heard of them / um / um / like luring sexual predators that way in / and then / like finding them and arresting them / I / I didn’t hear that they were making a whole / media thing out of it
[S22] Well / if / if a cop was to put up an add on Craig’s List for being a contract killer / and then someone was the contact them at that ad / then / then would they be able to nab that person for conspiracy / for conspiring to hire / a contract killer / cause now / now morally we’ve taken out whether or not it’s moral to be a child molester / but if the question is whether or not it’s moral / but / but / if the question is not about the morality of being a child molester and it’s about / reasonable expectation of privacy / or if it’s about / ya know / the cops being instigators in situations like this
[S23] Well / I think if you’re going / to knowledgeably undertake in something illegal / I mean / you have an expectation around every corner that something’s going to happen / and someone will find out and you’ll get caught / and 
[S21] I mean / I’d rather a cop be an instigator than a 13 year old boy
[S22] Yea
[S23] Yea
[S24] At the same time / the subject matter kinda comes into play / like / I know / I think you had some dealings with this / last year / over Facebook in the school
[S22] Yea / yea / I did a lot of stuff with that
[S24] And all that / I mean / you gotta think about if someone’s posting he’s gonna murder somebody / ya know / maybe you want to come out there
[S22] Yea
[S23] Yea
[S24] But if he’s posting that he was drinking / and he’s underage / is that really worth it?
[S23] Oh yea / I mean / there’s so many people
[S22] I mean / yea 
[S23] That would just swamp like / the entire resources of the police force [Laughter]
[S22] Like / hate crimes / um / threats of violence which are orientated around race, sexual orientation, gender, sexual harassment, or abuse / all these things are things that we all kinda came up with that the school should be or the school or authorities should be allowed to investigate / based on those
[S21] How do you draw the line though / again / like
[S22] Exactly / how do you draw the line? And / and / the school has / has this policy where like / if you go into the student life office you’re not allowed to look on Facebook because if they see pictures of drinking they are obligated to, once they see it, they’re obligated to do something about it
[S21] Really?
[S22] So / the / the middle ground that we’ve found is that they aren’t going to go out of their way / looking for something
[S21] Right
[S22] But / if it is / brought up for a reason which is under the realm of that umbrella of violence or threats or anything like that / and if they investigate that rightfully / then they can take you down for everything they see / like if they see a picture of you drinking a beer and you’re a freshman and you’re 18 / then they’ll take you down for that / as well as what they were originally looking for
[S23] Yea
[S24] How incriminating is a picture anyway / I know / ya know / common sense says / yea / there’s obviously beer in that can / yea / in his hand / but can they really say / without any doubt
[S22] They / they can’t send you down for drinking
[S21] Like if it’s in a solo cup or something
[S24] Yea / like / maybe / it’s not likely / and clearly it doesn’t really happen / but / maybe he just was holding it / posing in a picture
[S22] No / no / it is / it happens / it happens / I mean / if you have a solo cup there’s only so much they can do / if you have a solo cup and there’s beer in the background and you’re not 21 / then you were in the presence / and you were at a social gathering
[S21] Right
[S23] Yea
[S22] So they can get you for that charge / if you have a beer in your hand but you’re not drinking it / they can’t actually get you for drinking but they can get you for possession / and if there’s an actual picture of you / actually drinking / then it can be possession, underage, all that, and if there’s a picture of you with a beer bong then they can get you for all of the above and excessive / and if it’s clearly in your room then they can get you for all the above and social host
[S21] That’s so scary / which is gonna be my life for the next year cause I’m an RA
[S24] Well / with beer that’s pretty easy
[S23] Aww
[S22] Yea / yea / so you know about this stuff
[S21] Yea [Laughter]
[S22] You know about this stuff / but / I mean / just tell your residents / don’t be stupid / just / don’t put stupid pictures up
[S21] Yea / we have / like / the whole / all we’re doing now is like / like / privacy / like even privacy rights / like / just in Campion / like in the hallways / in their rooms / cause like / the rooms at the end of the hall / if you leave your door open / at / and you’re in a room at the end of the hall / that camera can see right inside your room
[S22] The end of the hall / do those cameras rotate?
[S21] Yea
[S22] They do? Alright
[S21] They can see inside your room / like not really that / like / it doesn’t go in your room / but like / your common room / like / it could see that / and / that’s one of the ways / um / that one room got written up / 
[S23] Wow
[S21] Actually a few nights ago / um / because they had left their door open / and there were beer cans on the floor / there were bottles on the table / and / that’s how they got written up
[S22] Because / they checked / do they check the camera for an incidence which was related to that room?
[S21] They / no 
[S22] They checked the camera for an incidence which wasn’t related to that room / or any of the residents who lived in that room
[S21] Yea / in that area / in that area
[S23] Wow
[S22] Well / once they see it / once they see it
[S21] But they’re obligated to do something once they saw it
[S23] Yea
[S22] Once they see it / they have to do something about it
[S21] So / they would have been fine if their door was shut [Laughter]
[S22] Yea / and the other thing is the law under the law doesn’t exactly / I mean / for the most part / doesn’t really extend onto this campus because of the fact that it is a private institution because of the fact that we legally agreed to abide by the code of conduct as specified in the handbook / so when you get in trouble you get a letter talking about which parts of the handbook you violated / so / they really have their own law code on campus / and their own judicial system / and / none of the legal stuff really applies / unless / well / whatever / yea
[S23] So that’s kind of / like / the opposite standard for what we just setup for / police luring and pedophiles / is they actively go out there and try to like / evoke this behavior in someone / to catch them at it / and 
[S21] The only thing that I think that’s weird about that / is like / do cops just one day say / um / we’re bored / let’s lure some pedophiles / like / is / or is that like someone’s job / like / I don’t understand that
[S23] It’s probably someone who’s good with computers
[S22] Yea / someone who’s good with / making them self seem like a horny, gay, 13 year old [Laughter] on / online / like / that’s good 
[S23] That’s a useful job skill
[S22] What do you do for a living? Oh / I bate pedophiles online [Laughter] / Yea 
[S21] Yea
[S23] Yea
[S22] Yea / but I mean / like / like / there’s / there’s also lots of upsides to things like / Facebook and Myspace / as social tools / as / things / as mechanisms for making freshmen feel more comfortable and more at home / when / whatever’s going on / um / ya know / new surroundings and whatnot / can research the community / join groups [Laughter]
[S23] Become a Facebook zombie
[S22] Yea / yea / kill hours at a time when you should be doing homework
[S23] Yea [Laughter]
[Do you guys just want to talk a little more about your opinions about Facebook and Myspace?]
[S21] Facebook / I think / is / a totally different story than Myspace 
[S23] Yea
[S21] Um / I think it’s a lot safer / and / it’s just / I don’t feel like it’s as public as Myspace / like / it’s really really public but Myspace is just like / anyone can get on that
[S23] Yea
[S21] Anyone / so
[S22] Yea / Facebook is / but Facebook is public although it’s less / it’s a little / like / Facebook / is public but you can expect a little bit more privacy just because of the way it’s setup
[S21] Yea / and I mean / you can make your profile or whatever / you can make it like private / like / if people like / want to friend you or something / and they’re not / something / I don’t know / someone else go
[S22] But / but / by the same token / while everything that you put on / Myspace / is / public as we’ve already decided / everything that you put on Facebook is owned my Mark Zuckerberg 
[S21] Right
[S22] And his crew / which means / and you agreed to that when you signed up / I did too.
[S21] Right
[S22] I checked the box too / which I think is gonna be great if he decides to be an asshole about it 21 years from now when we have like Senators / and what not who are now / and they have really embarrassing pictures of themselves on Facebook and he / can do what he wants with them
[S23] Oh man / [Laughter]
[S21] Uh-huh
[S22] For the most part / I mean / I’m sure they could make it hard for him / but he can / most / mostly do what he wants
[S21] That’s very true
[S23] [Laughter] / Never thought about that
[What do you think about that issue?]
[S21] Cause I know a lot of like / seniors even / like / they really have to be careful / like
[S22] Oh / yea
[S21] Like / about their Facebook / like what’s posted up there and what pictures are on there / and / like / when it comes to like getting jobs and stuff
[S22] Yea / I work as a recruiter / and I spend a lot of time on Facebook / looking at seniors Facebook profiles
[S21] Really? Wow
[S22] And / it’s good if somebody has a list of all the activities they do
[S23] Yea
[S22] Because then / there it is / it’s a list of everything / it’s right there / and / it’s not a showstopper if they have a crazy picture of them like hanging upside naked chugging a bottle of vodka or whatever / but / I mean / for a lot of recruiters and for a lot of companies / like / it definitely is
[S23] I think that’s kinda weird that they use that as like / a way to research you
[S22] Yea
[S23] I mean / I was just applying for summer jobs this year / and / on all of my applications like to target and stuff / I had to agree that they would do a background check on me
[S22] Yea
[S23] I was like / woo
[Laughter]
[S23] Ok / I don’t have anything / I don’t even have a credit report yet [Laughter] / I mean
[S24] Yea / and in some places that’s just a formality
[S22] Jeez
[S24] As far as like / for them to cover themselves legally
[S23] Yea / but it’s like weird / yea
[S22] Are you a convicted felon? Yes or No [Laughter] Can you make sure of that? Yes or No?
[S21] With Facebook / like are you / like / if you / somehow delete or like just get off Facebook / or whatever / does he still own those pictures? He does. That’s really interesting.
[S22] From the moment you put it up / it is property of Facebook
[S21] They’re his
[S24] Cause he owns the database and everything you put into it
[S23] Yea
[S22] Yea
[S21] I have my soul on Facebook
[Laughter]
[S22] Yea / he pretty much has a / are you / what year?
[S21] Freshman
[S22] Ok / last year / we sent out a letter / remember it?
[S24] Maybe / very vaguely
[S22] Ok / it / it / went to all the mail stops / it went to everyone’s mailbox on campus / and it said / ya know / student life doesn’t prowl around but ya gotta be careful because professors do and a lot of other people have Facebooks and even some administrators when they get curious / they have Facebook accounts / and they all look around and they all check / I mean / and they might / and you don’t know / so you still have to be careful and watch yourself / and also / Mark Zuckerberg owns everything you put up
[S21] Yea / right
[S23] That’s true / my writing professor first semester / had a Facebook and looked at all of ours
[S21] Oh my G-d
[S23] Like / over / like the first week of school to see what we were like and like to learn more about us / and then she told us about it and everyone was like / ew
[S21] Ew / that’s so awkward
[S23] It is
[Laughter]
[S23] I mean / I understand / it’s a really good way to learn more about people
[S21] Right
[S23] But
[S21] Still
[S23] Should it make us uncomfortable to think that like / an administrator or something was looking at our Facebook? / Should we have that kind of stuff up there?
[S24] I was / I think it just goes to show you / you have to understand what you’re putting up there
[S22] Got an important message
[S23] Right / yea
[S24] I mean / you’re not putting this in a private email
[S23] Right
[S24] You’re putting it out there for anybody / who wants to put down an account / or goes to college or high school or whatever
[S23] It’s still so much better than Myspace
[S24] Some people / you just don’t think about that / it’s kind of hard to have that foresight when Facebook first came out / and you just / there was that hype and you wanted to get in / people don’t really think / well / wait / employers could be using this against me a couple years from now
[S21] Is that why people like / use / like / another name as their profile name? Do you know what I’m saying?
[S22] People / people do that / but / I mean / it’s still linked to the email address
[S21] Oh / right, right, right, right
[S22] It’s just craziness / but Facebook does have its good sides too
[S21] Yea
[S22] As a publicity tool / social
[S24] Yea / they’re starting to use that software in companies too / to get employees sharing ideas / sort of / um / 
[S22] Yea
[S23] Aww
[S24] A way / it’s more anonymous in the sense that they want some lower level employees to share their ideas where / they don’t think they can if they’re like sitting next to the CEO
[S23] That’d be pretty cool / actually
[S24] So you just have everyone in there at the same level / shooting out ideas 
[S22] That’s a good idea / as an administrative tool
[S23] Yea
[S24] And just like / with Facebook / you have to understand what you say on there
[S23] Yea / that’s true
[S24] Is / it’s company / you have to make sure what you’re saying is appropriate
[S23] Yea / your boss is gonna [inaudible]
[S24] It’s a great tool to share ideas you just have the know the ramifications of ‘em
[So where do you think school officials should draw the line as to whether or not they’re invading privacy? With looking at these profiles or anything]
[S22] Depends if it’s a public or a private school
[S23] I think school officials / have a lot more leniency than like the police or something / because / parents are sending their kids to a school with like / an expectation that they’ll be kept safe and that school officials are gonna do all that they can / to / make a secure environment
[S21] Then again / school officials are / just / people / too / and they can still go on and look / I guess / we / they can / we’re / no one can tell them that they can’t
[S22] Well / there was a public school / I don’t remember where it was / but I read a USA Today article about it / like / almost a year ago / yea / it was a long time ago / where / it was a private school that kicked out a kid because he was gay / it was like a very religious school / something like that / um / and they did that / and as a private school like / they had the right to do that
[S21] Oh my G-d
[S22] I / I guess more or less / I don’t know how the case turned out / but / as / as a private school / I think that they / had the right to do that / but / at the same time / there was an argument that it was / that it was discrimination and that that put him / like / in a / ya know / it’s against like federal laws against discrimination and what not / and like / I think those laws apply / to like that school in a certain way / I don’t even know all the details / but / I think they apply even more so to public universities
[S21] Yea
[S22] Because / cause / if it’s a public school it’s getting the funding of a state government or a federal government then its actions / ya know / have to be / in accordance with / because / because then the state and federal government is accountable for what they do / so 
[S23] Schools should definitely have to / obey the higher laws first / of like the state and federal government
[S22] Yea
[S23] For / following up on their own / rules / wow
[S24] Well / if that were the truth every time someone got caught drinking underage the cops would be at the campus
[S23] Oh my gosh / yea / well / that’s true
[S24] And there’s sort of equilibrium there / the cops would be here swamping the campus
[S21] I feel like Loyola is sometimes in their own little bubble
[S23] That’s really true [Laughter] / there’d be like 100 people arrested every weekend
[S21] That’s true
[S22] The cops here don’t like busting us up / like 
[S21] It’s just more work for them
[S22] They don’t want to bust us up / and the RAs here / with some exceptions / with some exceptions / who feel like they’re on a moral crusade / most of the RAs here / most of the RAs here don’t like writing people up either
[S21] Yea
[S22] But / when the RA knocks on the door and it smells like weed / and the RA has to call a GRC to the student representative president and the cops and they have to make a big deal out of it / and when the cops get those calls / a lot of them are just like / oh / shit
[S21] Again?
[S22] We gotta go bust up a bunch of kids drinking / ya know / what are they really doing bad / they’re just drinking beers or whatever
[S21] We have to move
[S22] Yea [Laughter] / we have to move / we can’t just sit in our cars on Notre Dame and make sure no one gets robbed
[S21] In our Jeep Libertys [Laughter]
[S22] Like / yea / and / and by the same token / like / cops in / in suburban towns / cops in my town love busting up parties / they love hauling in all the kids who were being roughians [Laughter] and corrupting our society / but / like / if you had a bunch of 12 year olds at a kegger / on York Road / ya know / or on the Alamaeda / like somewhere in [inaudible] neighborhood / I don’t think the cops would really care [Laughter] cause they have much worse things to attend to / ya know?
[S21] Yea
[S23] And they should. They should go after like / the crack dealers first / before they start busting up parties
[S22] Yea / so from an enforcement standpoint / but then again / that’s the question / ya know /from an enforcement standpoint / how do you prioritize one law over another?
[S23] I guess / what’s harmful to more people in society? A bunch of kids drinking or a crack dealer with a / gun in their Lexus
[S21] Well / it could be a very peaceful crack dealer / and then / 30 kids drinking excessively / almost to death
[S23] I guess [Laughter]
[S22] Could be
[S21] So I guess / where do you draw the line then?
[S22] Yea / so / where do you / how do you prioritize? [Laughter]
[A little bit more]
[Laughter]
[S22] I guess / I guess what it all comes down to is like / the law is an inanimate thing / but / the people who are supposed to abide by it and the people who are supposed to / um / enforce it / are / animate and have judgment / and have to make split second decisions a lot of the time / so / it’s just like / I feel like there’s a lot of / if not so much gray area / there are just a lot of questions which people are / are always asking about like / well how do you reconcile it to / like / if / a bunch of cops make a bad decision and / say / highly politicized example 
[S21] Uh-huh
[S22] Like Rodney King / ya know / does that mean all law enforcement officers are crap? No. But it just shows that there is a very human / dimension to law enforcement / just like there is to any other profession / like / Enron / that was just human people / fucking up / like
[S21] Does anyone think there’s anything wrong with like / phone tapping for like terrorist reasons / or like / I don’t / stuff like that
[S23] They better have / a good reason / and / be able to / they better be able to defend it somehow 
[S21] For me / it’s really not that big of a deal / like / if they really wanted to tap my phone call conversation with my best friend / then / go ahead / I really don’t care / George Bush / if you have that / if you really don’t have anything else better to do / than listen to my plans for Saturday night / then / I mean / I don’t know
[S22] If / if it is for terrorist reasons / ya know / and / if it is clearly a threat to national security / I think absolutely 
[S21] Right
[S22] They should go ahead and do it / and even to an extent / if / if there are / ya know / administrative things in place which would prevent that from happening which in a lot of cases they are / then / like sure / ya know / the executive branch / I / I think they should have a little bit of leeway with doing that / but then there’s just a really important question that comes up from that / is / or / a couple / like / who gets to make the call of who they tap? And
[S21] And racial profiling
[S22] And / should that person be accountable / or not / cause if you hold them too accountable they might not be able to be effective / but they might be over effective if they’re acting without accountability / and then / also / if they hear / if / if they tap / ya know / some kid / who they think is a terrorist / and they hear him talking about money laundering / or they hear him talking about coke dealing / can they / can they prosecute him for that? When / they were going after something totally different
[S21] Right
[S22] And / and / when / although there are circumstances where it’s justified / it still is sidestepping the auspices of the justice system / more or less / which could be justified in certain cases / but / like / I mean / then / are they allowed to all of a sudden pull cases back into the justice system after stepping back out of it
[S21] Right
[S23] Yea
[S22] I don’t know / I’m not saying it’s morally wrong / I’m just saying these are like philosophical questions / which just punches out of the bag
[S21] [inaudible] Uh-huh / yea
[S22] Um / yea
[Any last minute words from anybody? Final thought on privacy]
[S22] Privacy / and then / and then like out / outside this country it’s even / it’s even more complicated / like we used to have all these / all these ties / ya know / back in / like during the Cold War / we had all these ties / ya know / with like / or / even in like the 60s with Noreaga and his bankers / and all these people / and the Cold War we had like / human assets / like people who we paid / and then / they got rid of all of them after that / and then 9-11 came around and they were all scrambling / like / well where are out human assets / who can we talk to? Ya know / and that just raises the questions about / well what about / privacy of people who are outside the country who are outside our jurisdiction / but / forces which originate within our jurisdiction are deliberately acting in ways which / but / there / there’s no government in / ya know / at the time / there was no government in Panama to make sure it didn’t happen / or the government in Columbia in the early 90’s / like / ya know / we were all collaborating or whatever / so / I don’t know / can’t really say if you’re for or against / it think it’s just so situational / it’s just so hard to make a blanket statement / it’s good / it’s bad
[S21] Right
[S22] Cause it’s so situational
[S23] Don’t post death threats on Myspace.
[S22] Yea / bad call / bad call
[Laughter]
[Ok]
