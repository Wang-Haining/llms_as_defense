There used to be a lot more gospels too 

There used to be a lot of them  and then they’re were like  oh  Luke and john  oh  that’s it  no more  those 4 are it  yea 

Cause the other ones didn’t agree  or  or cause  there were like specific problems with  um 

Ya know  Dead Sea scrolls

Yea

And  um  ya know  and this  this is just my opinion  and I wouldn’t  and I’m sure that there are like  theology buffs who would  ya know  argue this til the cows come home and hate it  but  I don’t know  I  I think that if you’re gonna talk about the like lessons that we’re supposed to be learning  I think like  ya know  Jesus and St. Peter  and all those people would be like  why are you people even talking about gay marriage and abortion right now  they would just be like  what  why  why are you even worrying about these things when there are so many more  like  pressing issues  to deal with and to think about 

Ya know  like  people starving  and war  and poverty  and  just  a lot more

There’s all like injustice  ya know

Yea  the church 

That’s proof  proof right there  that beliefs and the interpretation of the bible  are just  defined situationally

That they are  yea  and  and 

More proof  of that  was like  I mean  you  we  we all learned about this in Western Civ  the divine right of kings  if God chose the Pope and the Pope chose the king  God chose the king  king can do whatever the hell he wants 

And  ya know  like church’s silent acknowledgment of the Holocaust  like  all these things  just situationally  like  well  ya know  we gotta do this  so  we’re gonna do this  it just doesn’t seem so infallible when you  poke at it like that 

Did you ever play that game telephone?

Imagine that  but 2000 years old

Oh  ok 

Well  but  the Holy Spirit has also fed poor people all over the world  and  ya know
Well  the Holy Spirit guided us through the crusades 

And 

And now  the Holy Spirit is  making sure  we don’t let those gays get married 

He was an idolist  he believed in nothing 

Um  I  I like  um  learning about religions more than practicing them

I don’t really want to sign my name on the dotted line for one cause I think they’re all equally valuable

Alright  I’m gonna stop 

The Pope

Yea

But  Galileo 

Copernicus  everyone who wrote right after them had to put disclaimers in their books

In other countries too  I mean  like  a squirming 10 year old kid  isn’t really gonna want to sit in the pew for an hour  and then  kneel on that little thing  and  ya know  very very few kids are really gonna feel like they’re  I mean  cause kids are all like  ok  either I’m enjoying this or I’m not  and I’m not enjoying it  so  kids  it’s gonna be harder to find value in

I think a lot  a lot of what we’re saying though is grounded in the types of churches we grew up going to

And the types of things that we saw  but  in a lot of  other  kinds of communities  in a lot of other kinds of faiths  like  Christianity is like a tree trunk  with a billion and one branches  like  in Jamaica their masses are like fun  and  everyone’s all up on their feet  and it’s great  and  in  ya know  Baptist churches  in the south  or even in Southern Baptist churches in the north  people are all up on their feet  people are having fun  ya know  in all these  like  mystic religions  people all speak in tongues and all this stuff  and  even  ya know  like  there’s a guy downtown that gets 18,000 people to come to his church  once a week  it’s in an arena because he’s like  the sickest speaker ever   and he gives the best speeches  and  ya know  it really impacts people  and  all  although the church has done a lot of bad  like  I think it kinda has to be taken with a grain of salt  because they  although  I mean  it  it’s people to people  cause the church is only gonna be as good as the people who are doing it  so like  if there’s a missionary center set up in El Salvador  I think  it’s only gonna be as good as the people who are there staffing it  but  like  they do do a lot of good stuff  like  social service wise  ya know  just going into a neighborhood where people might  or a neighborhood area country mountainside  wherever  where people  feel like they don’t have a lot going on  they don’t have  ya know  a lot of positive things in their life  and  and giving them some kind of faith  ya know

Just usually it’s Christian faith  and they’re like  now change everything you’re doing and do this instead 

Or at least try

No

Yea

I  I think you don’t  and I think you shouldn’t  because  a certain altruistic  dimension to that type of work  is then gonna be lost in what you’re doing  because  you’re going there in a self-serving way  to try and  ya know  service your faith somehow  with some sort of superiority to theirs  so  even though that is a downside  and even though that is really troubling to me  every time I’ve seen it  which is just about any place you’ll travel to  where it’s going on  um  they at least deserve credit  because  they’re doing something  and they’re doing more than most other people  and they’re doing more than almost any other single organization  and they’re  and  and  like  a very very substantial portion of  of agencies which are really out there for social justice issues  are faith based  which for me  who’s definitely not a Christian person  it’s difficult  but like  I can still get over that and work with them because these are the agencies which are the most established  and which have the most  kind of social service infrastructure  even if it is  not entirely altruistic  and they are just trying to propagate  and proselytize  and whatever

Yea  to do good things or bad things  but  a lot of times good things too

They need an outlet for sexual frustration

Do you think human beings or inherently  or  do you think that being  celibate  and not procreating  is  somehow contrary to human nature? Like that humans are inherently sexual beings  and then  this creates some kind of imbalance

Whole procreation?

And to do it  I don’t think they have to live this life of chastity

Well  I’ve met a lot of  celibate priests and nuns who were really awesome and who were really cool people  and  I’ve also met a lot of them who are just  messed up

In the head  like  people who are just like  50  who are just  and act like they’re out of their minds  just  in the way they communicate 

like  I  I saw this one nun who ran  um  a  kinda like a boarding school or quote unquote  troubled children  in a third world country  and  she was  she was just nuts  she was out of her mind  she would be smacking the kids  and stuff  and this is a nun

And  and  I  I  I just saw  I came to see her  like  by the end of the day  and it’s just like  this big angry bag of sexual frustration that was taking it out on these little boys  and I was just like  what is this  like  ya know

Well  you have to retreat into your own little world

Because you’re giving up a very substantial part of  a part of the world

And watching everyone else go through it

And some  and somehow being in a position of moral authority over them  where they come to you  asking you for guidance about things like this  and you’re just like  yea  well  Lord says that

I know a lot priests who are alcoholics

Who are raging alcoholics  people who are like very high-functioning alcoholics  like  they’ll get absolutely hammered at dinner  every single night  drinking like alcohol  and then get up and do a mass at 5 in the morning  and just be like fine with it  just cause  they drink a lot  and even  I’ve heard people say that they’ve just come to terms with  they’re like when G-d wants me  he’ll take me  sitting there  like smoking cigarettes  drinking  like  crazy stuff like that

But  I mean  our  our experiences  are like  the American Catholic Church

And there’s Catholicism everywhere  and there’s Islam everywhere  and  Shintoism and Buddhism and  all those other stuff  all over the place  which  ya know  you really can’t come up with an argument that any one is more or less valuable than the others  so  I feel like  the only way that anyone could really be  like  a true anything  would be to know  and compare and contrast to the other ones  because  if you don’t know anything  about  Islam  then  how do you not know that it doesn’t call you and that you don’t feel more spiritually fulfilled  or visa versa  like  if you’re  if you grew up Muslim  and  you don’t know anything about Judaism  and then all of a sudden  you meet  some Hebrew dude who all of a sudden  I know with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  that sounds unfeasible  but  like  it really is

Because it’s wrong

The bible says  we’ll all go to hell

And  and the reason that they would probably say  is because  there are no women priests in the bible

Well  not  not they  I mean  you really can’t generalize like that  by bad  but like  the reason why  I think a lot of people would say  a lot of people would contend

That’s what Catholicism means though 

Universal

Or  they just don’t even about Catholicism  they just go through the motions  like cafeteria Catholics

You ever heard that term?

I read this thing  by the Pope  in like 1986  I think it was  or some  some year  this big long papal thing  called  Gaudi in that said that it was the church’s  the church needed to  be dynamic  so that it could  the church needed to be dynamic so that it could fully engage in an ever changing world  I think is what it said  or so that it could fully engage with an ever changing world  like  I don’t know  how  do  things that were written in the Middle East 2000 years ago  translate to a global economy now for instance

Because  I don’t know  the same people who that gay rights and all that stuff is really bad  aren’t really looking at  a lot  other really horrible injustices  which  just  attention isn’t really called to as much  or which they’re apathetic towards  on a global scale
