 Decriminalized it  didn’t they?  So if you’re caught with it you just get fined instead of it being a criminal charge

 Yea 

 Um  yea  uh  I  I think it was different from California cause it wasn’t like a medical use statute  it was a  it was a decriminalization  so it takes it from a status of a criminal charge  which is permanent on your record to more like a traffic ticket  so if you’re caught with a small  like selling is still a felony  but if you’re caught with a small amount you don’t have like  a bail set or a mandatory minimum sentence  it’s like a slap on the wrist  kind of like a traffic ticket would be

 Yea  yea  maybe I’m wrong  but  either way 

 Yea  I mean 

 It’s like  half legalization

 It’s like  pretty much

 Well I mean  yea  in  in L.A though  it’s a lot easier to get it cause you can go to doctors who will write you a prescription and then you can go to any one of the number of stores  and you can just pick it up

 It’s just if  I mean  either way  I guess in terms of court fees  like  it costs the state a lot to bring people in and book ‘em in jail and put them through an appeals process

 and pay for probation and all that kind of stuff  so  I guess it’d  it’d be interesting to know if there’s a correlation between this and  all the things that people say are the harmful effects  like  ya know  car accidents 

 Well  yea  cause they have same  like by volume  they have just the same amount of carcinogens  but the thing is like  a cigarette smoker will smoke like  like three or four cigarettes a day  and a pothead’ll smoke like half a  a half a cigarette worth  and be  and good 

 I think  the effects  it’s probably like  I think just from what I’ve heard  I think respiratory  the respiratory effects are the worst

 Well  the chemical that actually does what it does  breaks down into like  four or five hundred different compounds

 Yea  and they all  do  but that’s like  I guess that’s after  the use and whatnot  but like  yea

 Yea  yea

 Unlike Alcohol

 I think  LSD goes to your spine.

 Yea

 It might be  it might be  I don’t know

 Yea  I mean 

 It seems like  you hear a lot about people  doing stupid things when they’re drunk  right?

 And you hear a lot about people like  running over kids in the street and all that kinda stuff  um  and  the only real bad thing you ever hear about people doing when they’re stoned is getting arrested for  being stoned

 Which is

 Well  it wouldn’t be a good idea to legalize it now because it has such a novelty attached to it  that as soon as they legalize it  it would just  it would blow up

 and  people would have no sense of mind  I mean  it wouldn’t be like  I don’t know  I guess  if you’re like a 16 year old kid and you’re trying to rebel against your parents  doing something that’s against the law is cool 

 Ya know  if it’s not against the law it’s not as cool 

 Oh  absolutely

 Absolutely

 Yea  no  it definitely  cause  it pushes it underground  it’s like  I mean  did  did prohibition do more good or bad? The prohibition of alcohol

 Like people got shot  with Tommy guns  all the time  ya know?

 I mean like  I’m not sticking up for it  but like

 A lot of those crimes are just  are crimes of necessity  because like  I mean  if you live in a place where you really  there are no jobs for you  and  there’s no childcare  and  yea

 Yea

 Exactly

 yea  it’s about the paper  it’s about the money

 Yea
 it would end up being so commercialized

 Yea  I mean  it would end up being a very  very very commercial thing  and  it probably would blow up like that

 Like right off the bat

 Oh  Yea

 Well  I mean  the government would make  a lot of money on that  but I think realistically  the economy would slow down

 Because everyone would be high all the time

 So  like

 People would  I mean  honestly  I think a lot of things  would slow down

 If it happened

 True  true

 But  it’s like  it’s a different kind of incapacitation though  isn’t it  like  smoking versus drinking 

 Yea  definitely  I mean  if there’s not as much of a  like  pass out 

 Kinda thing  like there is with alcohol  ya know  I don’t know

 No

 Well  I mean  I think  like  substances that are illegal in their illegal state they induce people to ask questions

 If it  from a standpoint of maintaining an ordered society  the questions that you don’t want people to be asking  like  the whole  the whole like  end the Vietnam War era that our parents were all about in the sixties  like  that was  ya know  on Capitol Hill  that was really  people said it was like a drug induced phenomenon

 Ya know  and I think it just contributed to 

 To all the outlawing and whatnot  I mean  if someone does something  and they’re like  this is illegal  I’ve heard this is bad my whole life  but  I feel fine

 Then it just kinda  downplays  like  just the whole  the whole concept of laws 

[S21] Right

 Yea  but about the whole crimes of necessity thing  like  people don’t have jobs  that’s why they’re gonna turn to  selling drugs  and whatever 

 It’s nothing that hasn’t happened before 

  No  I mean  just the consolidation of small businesses into larger ones  that’s what I mean

 Yea

 And  I mean  if it was legal to have  I feel like so many people would not even buy it  they would just grow it  themselves

 I don’t know. That’s a whole other question 

 It  it would probably be 

 That’s what it would probably be

 It would be  but then  then enforcing that license would take a whole new  ya know  budgetary concern  cause it’d be expensive

 Yea  exactly  but you’d probably see the same kind of consolidation  of like  mom and pop grocery stores  and then  Stop and Shops  and Big Y’s  and Wal-Marts  ya know 

 Which would be interesting  

 Well  it would be  but  the whole  the whole attitude of it being taboo  would  would remain

 For a while  like  I  I don’t think people would warm up to it  like it would be  I think certain demographics would  jump on it  like shit on Velcro  and certain demographics would still  like  our grandparents wouldn’t be pleased

 Yea  seriously 

 Yea

 I don’t know  it could be very interesting 

 Um 

 Yea

 I mean  does drinking make you want to smoke crack?
 I think  no more than smoking pot would  you wouldn’t do coke or anything 

 Yea

 Yea

 I mean  also 

 Yea

 I learned in my high school health class that if you have sex before you get married you go straight to hell 

 And  I mean  it’s all about  like the epistemology  like  how do you get to the point that you accept something as fact  and what are you’re assumptions underneath it  ya know  [sigh]  that would be interesting

 Might modify American culture a little bit  I think a lot more people would buy video games and snack food

 Yea 

 It’s regulated  but  it’s pretty much

 Is there a tax on it? Do you know?

 I’m sure  yea  well  I mean  it’s regulated like a liquor license 

 And so are like  mushrooms  and prostitution  

 And pretty much everything else

 But  I mean  but  from the standpoint of someone who’s been elected  like  you owe it to your constituents to keep them happy  so  if you think you’re gonna keep them happy by leading a moral crusade against  like penguins

 Then  you will lead a moral crusade against penguins  because you’re constituents will think you’re the man  ya know  and  that  that just seems like the same kinda like  random thing  just  people decided they were gonna lead a moral crusade against weed  but not alcohol  when  it could realistically  just as easily see alcohol being banned  as marijuana  for the exact same reasons 

 Yea

 What do you mean?

 Against  marijuana?

 well  but  neither were our parents when they were our age  I mean  not all of our parents  but probably more of them than they would admit to us

 But  but  there’s still a big  I mean  it’s very important to consider that there’s still  like  a big  thing  in our culture  like  it’s not a mature thing to do  like  once you’re out of college  you’re just  an asshole 

 Yea  once you’re out of college  it’s really frowned upon 

 Oh  you still do that  yea  it’s like  you didn’t kick that already?

 And so  I guess that kind keeps it in a healthy balance on its own

 Because like  and I  I still don’t  I don’t think that  that would go away  if it were legalized

 Yea  I don’t think anyone does

 Well  I mean  obviously  if you smoke marijuana  you do things like shoot your friend in the face by accident  ya know wait  you guys didn’t see that commercial?

 You’ve seen that commercial?

 Yea  there was this commercial  where the kid’s like  I’m so high right now  and he picks up a gun and shoots his friend in the face

 Harold and Kumar made fun of that

 They made fun of the commercial

 Yea  it’s craziness  but I mean  there are still places where it’s illegal but it’s accepted

 Like Jamaica

 You have anymore questions?

 I mean  and  professors at this school have told me  on multiple  and  and  I  and professors at other schools  like  professors all over the place  like some of the smartest people we know  have told me that  like  in college  in their college experience  they sat around and smoked  and  intellectualized with their friends  like  they got very into the philosophical material they were learning  current events  about debates and all that thing  and  it  I don’t know  it  it’s just interesting  and I’ve seen a lot of that go on here  like I’ve seen kids who are in the same philosophy class  just smoke  and get in like  huge discussions  if their professors were there  they’d be like so happy that these kids were discussing the material outside of class  they’d like give them extra credit points  even though they’re high as shit  like
 Yea

 Well  but  like  but at the same time  there’s something very very hypocritical about  if a kid has ADD  we prescribe  schedule 2 narcotics  to our four and five year olds  we give them  Ritalin  which if you’re caught with it on the street without a prescription  it’s a felony  if you have it in the right quantity  and we give it to kids  to make them  like easier to manage

 But at the same time  like  there’s something just very hypocritical about  I mean  even  even  just like  just like  Ritalin  and Adderall 

 Like  they’re  they are stimulants  that are very illegal to carry in one context  but encouraged in one  in another context  and actually  encouraged and sold by an industry which is very very very powerful and accounts for a big percentage of our economy

 Ya know  the pharmaceutical industry  I wonder what would happen if the pharmaceutical industry totally got behind the idea of medicinal marijuana  I wonder if that’s what it would take for it to all of a sudden be like  cool  ya know

 I don’t know 

 Well  but  the scientists who define that  there’s the FDA  who like  regulates  and then there’s the people in the pharmaceutical industry  so automatically  the people in the pharmaceutical industry have very big vested interest in the FDA  cause the FDA basically like  squeezes their wallet 

 When it wants to  and so those are the scientists who are all working together  to do this  and so  if they’re the scientists who said that like  Ritalin is ok  and who said Adderall is ok  and who said Zoloft and Paxil are ok  Zoloff and Paxil do the exact same thing that ecstasy does  just  in a very very very small and controlled way  it’s the same chemical in your brain  serotonin  it’s the same thing that ecstasy does

 And  what’s even more  you can build up a tolerance to those drugs

 And the same thing  to the point where you have kids who are taking 15 to 20 milligrams a day  at the age of 7  and this  and we’ve only been doing this for 10 or 15 years  so  down the road  like 

 I mean  we don’t even know what psychological effects we’re gonna have  and I think people should be equally as skeptical of that as they should be of weed 

 Yea 

 They’re all drugs
