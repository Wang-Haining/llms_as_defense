 Yea

 Uh-huh

 Right

 Right

 Like that Tila Tequila girl  or whatever  she had 1 million friends

 On Facebook  she’s famous now

 And she’s expecting like  people would expect things to be private?  With 1 million friends  friends

 Yea 

 Yea  it’s not as private as like a phone call or something 

 Like  that’s totally different

 Right

 A death threat  uh-huh


 Yea

 Right

 Oh  um 

 Sickos that need to get off the streets anyways
 
 I mean  I’d rather a cop be an instigator than a 13 year old boy

 How do you draw the line though  again  like

 Really?

 Right

 Like if it’s in a solo cup or something

 Right

 That’s so scary  which is gonna be my life for the next year cause I’m an RA

 Yea 

 Yea  we have  like  the whole  all we’re doing now is like  like  privacy  like even privacy rights  like  just in Campion  like in the hallways  in their rooms  cause like  the rooms at the end of the hall  if you leave your door open  at  and you’re in a room at the end of the hall  that camera can see right inside your room

 Yea

 They can see inside your room  like not really that  like  it doesn’t go in your room  but like  your common room  like  it could see that  and  that’s one of the ways  um  that one room got written up  

 Actually a few nights ago  um  because they had left their door open  and there were beer cans on the floor  there were bottles on the table  and  that’s how they got written up

 They  no 

 Yea  in that area  in that area

 But they’re obligated to do something once they saw it

 So  they would have been fine if their door was shut 

 The only thing that I think that’s weird about that  is like  do cops just one day say  um  we’re bored  let’s lure some pedophiles  like  is  or is that like someone’s job  like  I don’t understand that
 
 Yea

 Facebook  I think  is  a totally different story than Myspace 

 Um  I think it’s a lot safer  and  it’s just  I don’t feel like it’s as public as Myspace  like  it’s really really public but Myspace is just like  anyone can get on that

 Anyone  so

 Yea  and I mean  you can make your profile or whatever  you can make it like private  like  if people like  want to friend you or something  and they’re not  something  I don’t know  someone else go

 Right

 Right

 Uh-huh

 That’s very true

 Cause I know a lot of like  seniors even  like  they really have to be careful  like

 Like  about their Facebook  like what’s posted up there and what pictures are on there  and  like  when it comes to like getting jobs and stuff

 Really? Wow

 With Facebook  like are you  like  if you  somehow delete or like just get off Facebook  or whatever  does he still own those pictures? He does. That’s really interesting.

 They’re his

 I have my soul on Facebook

 Freshman

 Yea  right

 Oh my G-d

 Ew  that’s so awkward

 Right

 Still

 Is that why people like  use  like  another name as their profile name? Do you know what I’m saying?

 Oh  right, right, right, right

 Yea

 Then again  school officials are  just  people  too  and they can still go on and look  I guess  we  they can  we’re  no one can tell them that they can’t

 Oh my G-d

 Yea

 I feel like Loyola is sometimes in their own little bubble

 That’s true

 It’s just more work for them

 Yea

 Again?

 We have to move

 In our Jeep Libertys 

 Yea

 Well  it could be a very peaceful crack dealer  and then  30 kids drinking excessively  almost to death

 So I guess  where do you draw the line then?
 
 Uh-huh

 Does anyone think there’s anything wrong with like  phone tapping for like terrorist reasons  or like  I don’t  stuff like that

 For me  it’s really not that big of a deal  like  if they really wanted to tap my phone call conversation with my best friend  then  go ahead  I really don’t care  George Bush  if you have that  if you really don’t have anything else better to do  than listen to my plans for Saturday night  then  I mean  I don’t know

 Right

 And racial profiling

 Right

 Right

 [inaudible] Uh-huh  yea

 Right
