It wasn’t even a diagnosis until 1980. Many people just envision the Tom Brokaw ‘Greatest Generation’ model. A lot of what Brokaw said was true, but he left out a big piece of it. I think it was easier for people to accept, but in my research, what I was surprised to find out was that only twenty-five percent of WWII veterans had been in combat zones. So if you have three quarters of the men not in combat zones, the majority might come back with no problems, but that 25 percent is still four million men.
I just think because they didn’t talk about it. There wasn’t any good treatment. When I got my dad’s VA files, I saw how long he had been trying to get help and they pretty much dismissed him for a long, long time. He finally got 100% disability rating when he was 80 years old. He had been trying since 1946. They really did not acknowledge it, so the children didn’t even know.  A lot of us children have connected and we had no clue that our families weren’t the only ones. We didn’t even know to talk about it, I guess.
	In conclusion, The difficulties that they had to face included women losing work in the workplace due to their return, their authority to their children upon returning and birth rate increase, and abusive as well as behavioral problems that they had as a result of the war that might of ended up in higher divorce rates. Alot of people didn't believe that PTSD might of existed for the soldiers in the war since many military officials didn't acknowledge it during the war, but it based on so much experience and information out there, it is indeed very real, and very saddening at that.
