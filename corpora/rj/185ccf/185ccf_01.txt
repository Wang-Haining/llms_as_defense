Just as the veteran cannot control his flashbacks nor can an individual who lives fighting depression control the days they feel down. The good news is we can try!
Unlike a bad case of the chicken pox, depression is not visible.  I have been told my depression is all in my head. Obviously, if you can’t see it, it cannot exist, right? Wrong!  We are near or next to people each day and have no idea they fight to embrace the positive side of existence.
There are days when I feel like that cartoon character that walks around with a pesky rain cloud overhead. Other days, I awake to find sunshine in my head, heart and soul.
Each day, I struggle to achieve inner peace and true happiness. My tool box filled with tips and tricks of being positive shows wear and tear from years of usage. It isn’t sitting in the corner collecting dust. Each morning, I write in my journal.
Writing in my journal helps steer me towards the positive, set goals and recognize achievements from the previous day. In bed, at night, I visualize positive ending scenarios. Each day, I push forward through the storm, towards the bright light of smiles and feel good moments.
Some days I dance, some days I falter.
Some days I am a circus clown doing a juggling act. Often, I grow weary and tired. Yet, I continue my goal to push through the wall that often seems to block my path to a life of content. Determination and the knowledge that I am a winner keeps me going.
 What is one thing that made you smile today?
