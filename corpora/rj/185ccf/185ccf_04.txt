I am sitting here chuckling. I KNOW, I am going to buy a new camera. Someone I used to know, suggested one and why not? I have an excellent opportunity (excuse?), to buy a new toy for capturing life in a click.

Those of you that follow this blog, know I often write about pushing through panic by facing the fear.   Itâ€™s something I have lived through.  Even now. Therefore, I empathize and share what has helped me.
 Almost, everyone has a fear. Not necessarily, one they verbalize.

It may be a fear of how they might die, or the common one, speaking publicly.
 The fear is hidden back in the subconscious mind.
 A person can envision it, but it is not often shared.

I have two.
    1) I am an avid swimmer, yet I have a deep-rooted fear of dying underwater. The scenario? A situation where I am unable to swim to the surface to breathe. An example: Where I grew up, there is a stretch of road between Charlestown, NH and Bellows Falls, VT. This section has a wall of slate on one side of the road and a long drop off to the Connecticut river on the other.  It plays out, for some unknown reason, my car is forced off the road into the deep water. My seat belt is stuck, I cannot escape. EEEEEK!
    2) The other one, I watched my grandmother live. Being legally blind. She went in to have cataract surgery and it was discovered, after surgery, she had maculate degeneration. So, when the cataract was removed her eye became worse, instead of better. Then over time, the cataract in the other eye became worse. Rendering her blind in both eyes. Creepy, yet true.
Yesterday, I had my eyes checked.  I was told I have the beginning stages of cataracts. Give me the bifocals! But DO NOT tell me I have cataracts! Also, maculate degeneration is hereditary. Thankfully, there is no sign of it. A reprieve.

NO! I do not spend my days, morbidly worrying about these fears. On a rare occasion, they are barely a brief, flash of a thought, then gone.

So, what is YOUR fear?
