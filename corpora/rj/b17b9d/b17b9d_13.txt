This class has changed my entire worldview of possibly everything pertaining to the government in Latin America and issues that have erupted due to the government of America. Learning about neoliberalism and how it briefly dominated almost the entire region of Latin America impacted my thoughts about the country.  Until then, I rarely learned about the countries, and when we did learned about them the concepts were only black and white concerning the mass amounts of corruptions, and how much women have dominated the political spectrum.   Neoliberalism is a very temporary ideology that did help many regions come out of the military dictatorship but served as a major obstacle against workers and people in poorer communities. Expecting a form of democracy to serve as a backlash to a community helped me realized there are flaws in even the American government as well concerning its divisive policies.   Argentina was one of my favorite countries to learn about since the community played an important to fixing the government with the start of mothers or the Plaza de Mayo. The best part to me was the ideology of indigenous women.  Patriarchy is a struggle, but for them to include men and women as compatible being and that the community is the entire being is a beautiful concept that seems plausible for these groups.  With Euro-American ideas installed into me, concepts such as this surprise me on why we cannot take little notions from this.  This class entirely is probably the most informative and I will definitely add this to my academic discourse in the future.
