	Nicaragua’s shift to the left has caused more of a shift to the ideology of women and feminism on whether which concepts are more crucial.  Feminism largely emerged after the Sandinista Revolution in 1974 but the Sandinista party narrowed the agenda regarding gender issues.  The shift to the left allowed the creation of social and feminist groups, but did not prioritize them as crucial Nicaraguan politics especially in regards to sexual right and abortions due to their ties to the Catholic Church.  There was a high poverty “frame” that “victimized” women since they were not in a productive process which seemed to be a higher crisis considering the state of the country and the results of the Contra War did not economically help the country.  The feminist movement flourished for a period once the non-Sandinista government took control, but by 2006 the Sandinista regained power again and the FSLN became the new left for feminism.  Although this served as an obstacle to feminism, women were still considered financially and the government saw them as more needs based than rights based.
	Overall the shift the Left did help women mainly in one way; financially.  The rights of women remained at debates regarding aspects of the traditional families, sexual rights, and abortions. Considering most of these regions delving out of neoliberalism it seems plausible that since the state is trying to regain economic stability, they would apply that concept in many sectors of the community.  Argentina and Ecuador seemed to receive more women into the government but even the said rights remained controversial in their community.  Women in Nicaragua may not have received that much in regards to rights and needs but the shift to the left has help feminist groups understand to role of class along with state of the region which might lead to their change of the agenda.
