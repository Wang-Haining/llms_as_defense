	With a different ideology for a different government and reliance on men there has been raised conflicts amongst liberal feminist and indigenous feminists.   Indigenous women desired to recover their original philosophical principles of their culture and combine with the reality of the region where “equilibrium” of men and women exists, and the maintenance of double militancy, the linking of gender specific troubles to struggle of autonomy. Since much of Mexican feminists “borrowed much” from Euro-American feminists with the application of Catholic standards, it has led to an obstacle of little understanding to the reasoning of indigenous incorporation of said ideas and philosophy.  Land is very crucial in the community, and is considered as the “bountiful deity” that must be treated equivocally such as its inclusion as right furthering the division of liberal feminist intent.
Indigenous women and feminists have shared many struggles in incorporating their policies into a higher sector of the feminist community.  Although the ideas have submerged and has been inserted into the dominant global international feminists discourse, much action has not been taken place contemporarily.  It is the compatibility of their policies to the entire region that served as the obstacle and the lack of comprehension amongst the groups.  As time goes on, instead of their being one distinct agenda in response to one group, there would be an agenda suitable for the whole community.
