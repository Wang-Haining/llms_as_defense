With the caseloads at Deerwood Academy being of an extremely high capacity, I propose for the sharing of SST personnel between two schools to be re-examined.  A number based amount of caseloads should be the rule of thumb when the decision is made as to whether a SST coordinator will be for one or two schools.  We must remember that SST cases commence throughout the school year and coordinators also need time to manage with effectiveness and usefulness.
It would also be of a best practice if SST information is more prevalent in school faculty meetings.  I sometimes see the work of the SST coordinator as a “silent department” in the building as the voice of SST is not heard as loud as grade level conversations or school wide vocality.  The overall performance of the SST coordinator effects the schools CCRPI score and should be moved to a higher realm of comprehension in the building as to how it is the “hand of support” in student achievement.  Some of the anxiety that teachers have when they see a students’ performance is not at grade level should be alleviated when they know the supports are in place to strengthen the instruction and alleviate problems that exist in student learning.
The final proposed change would reflect the SST coordinator being a part of professional learning communities that directly relate to student achievement inclusive to grade level teams, literacy teams, math teams, and the PBIS committee.  Our school seems to “run” to the SST process when a problem needs to be addressed versus the SST coordinator being able to advance preventative tactics when instructional planning, preparation, and data review is performed.  All of these proposed changes would help both student and teachers achieve the goal of student success!
