The MTSS process needs to be aligned and integrated with school improvement initiatives. The MTSS model supports the capacity of schools within the district to implement and use the MTSS framework for integrating and aligning their multiple school improvement initiatives. Within a comprehensive approach, school improvement teams will include SST Coordinators from each cluster to implement relevant SST / RTI data into a data driven approach to school improvement initiatives through the use of the MTSS model. Through the MTSS model SST Coordinators will analyze student data and identify root causes for problems, determine actions to address them, and appropriately place students in courses that promote student achievement. School improvement plans shall contain clear, unambiguous targets, explicit indicators and actual measures, and expeditious time frames for SST Coordinators meeting the measurement standards. Plan development and implementation is to be executed with fidelity.  The newly comprised school improvement team shall evaluate critical components of the school improvement initiative and focus on local school needs. School improvement teams should recognize this as a guiding principle to evaluate the plans effectiveness through the use of data. If data analysis indicates a need to focus school-level goals in one area such as student instruction or teacher quality, then the team should include tasks that specifically address these needs.
