    I think the best statistic to use based on this analysis would be doubles. Not only does it have the highest correlation with the hall of fame chances but it’s also the least likely to be thought of as important to other analysts unless they perform similar analysis. Baseball is centered mainly on home runs with doubles grouped together with all other hits and not thought twice about. Focusing on doubles as the primary statistic while also using hits and RBI’s as secondary measures would lead to the most success in predicting the odds that you are getting a Hall of Fame caliber player.
