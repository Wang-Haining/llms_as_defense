As a systems analyst your primary function is to lead a group of employees within your area of expertise in order to implement an intended project within a timeframe presented and to an expected quality. This job can be extremely stressful on someone because it requires many of the skills of a project manager but also extensive knowledge of computer systems. A system analyst must have strong communication skills in order to relay messages from the project manager while also gaining the trust and respect of fellow employees. In addition to communication skills, a systems analyst needs to have strong problem solving skills as they are expected to test and troubleshoot all systems before they are implemented. A systems analyst must also be an effective writer because they are expected to produce documentation for steps in developing the system. All in all, to be a good systems analyst one should possess the abilities to interact with others, think quickly, and be able to expect and embrace new tasks on a daily basis.
	Within an organization there is always room for a systems analyst. It is a good idea to have someone that’s primary goal is to test the system and make sure that the employees are meeting all qualifications and provide leadership and guidance to these employees.  A systems analyst also brings the ability to bridge the gap for a company between IT personnel and the project manager. While a project manager may have some IT knowledge, unless they come from a background in IT it is a good bet that they will not fully understand what is going on. A systems analyst gives the company someone who has a great deal of IT knowledge as well as management skills.
	Implementing a systems analyst within your organization can present several advantages to the company. First off, it can take off a lot of stress from the companies project manager. Having a systems analyst allows the project manager some room to delegate their responsibilities. The project manager will still be in charge of the project and make sure everything goes according to the timeline that has been outlined but they no longer need to work closely with the employees on a daily basis because, which can now be delegated to a systems analyst. Another benefit is that it establishes a hierarchy within the organization. A project manager has so much on their plate that it can feel as if the employees are in charge of themselves. If someone doesn’t meet a deadline it can be difficult for the project manager to discipline these individuals because they have so many other tasks to worry about, which can result in these employees failing to meet deadlines.  Having a systems analyst gives the project manager someone that can work with these employees in order to assure that deadlines are met. One more benefit of adding a systems analyst to your company is that it provides you with someone that has extensive knowledge of troubleshooting systems and technology. When a complex problem develops that programmers and IT staff may not have a difficult time figuring out, a systems analyst can step in and provide a different perspective that may lead to a solution.
