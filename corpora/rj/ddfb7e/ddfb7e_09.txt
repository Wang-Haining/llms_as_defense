Eddy Piniero hit 21 of 25 FGA last season, and made 11 from 40-yards plus. Punter Johnny Townsend led the nation in punt yardage at 47.9 per attempt last season, and he returns as well. Callaway should be huge in returns, and he had two for TDs last year.

The defensive turnover has to be a concern considering that was Floridaâ€™s bread and butter last year. While the defense may accordingly take a step back, offensive improvement seems all but certain. Jim McElwain should ensure that. So, in conclusion, keep an eye on the cornerback and quarterback positions as potential spots of weakness, but the Gators will again contend in the SEC while being nowhere near well-rounded or experienced enough to be in the running for a National Title. NCAA football oddsmakers expect a one-game regression to 8 wins this year, but it seems more likely that Florida hands  in a repeat performance with a 9-win season and possible SEC title.
