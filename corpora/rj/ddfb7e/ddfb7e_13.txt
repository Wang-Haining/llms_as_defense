The Bulls still did have three Second-team All-Conference defensive players in Deandrin Senal, Deatrcik Nichols and Auggie Sanchez. Sanchez has plenty of experience (37 starts) and led USF in tackles last season with 120. Bruce Hector also returns, and he tied Sanchez with the team lead in total sacks (6). The secondary will feature Nichols, Ronnie Hoggins, Abraham, and Tajee Fullwood. It should be fine despite the losses of both Hassan Childs and Nate Godwin.

USF kicker Emilio Nadelman was 7 of 7 on FGA last season before he missed the final four games with a leg injury. Punter Jon Hernandez transferred from Florida State and walked on to average 41.2 yards per punt attempt on 63 tries. Johnson made the All-AAC second team as a return man, and he will handle the punt returns.

Overall, the Bulls should be in roughly the same place as last season, but that means a repeat as Conference champions. USF is more poised and ready to become a major program than an AAC champ, however, and that is why the school hired Strong, a proven winner. USF did have to share the Conference title with Temple last year, so perhaps the most realistic goal is just sweeping AAC play and becoming the lone conference champ. USF also dodged the FSU Seminoles on the schedule this year, making a one-game improvement pretty realistic, despite oddsmakers expecting the team to regress to 10-wins. It seems far-fetched to expect USF to win 12 games, but winning all its Conference matchups would put it in place to do just that.
