With only the fact there was a heated argument between Fletcher and McCarthy two nights before the murder, there was no other evidence which points the murder towards Simon Fletcher. At the crime scene, no items were left behind and the knife belonged to neither the McCarthy nor the Fletcher household; and although the murder was obviously gruesome, no clothes of Simon Fletcher were found with blood stains on them. When a neighbor was to describe what he saw that night, he was unclear with his statement and unable to describe the car that approached the house. He also did not report anyone going to the McCarthy household. Other than this neighbor, there were no other witnesses.
Innocence is often hard to prove in violent crimes such as murder, but is most definitely possible. On November 30th, there was no possible way Simon Fletcher killed his brother-in-law, Norton McCarthy, merely being that nearly his entire day is accounted for by others; there was no real motive behind why Fletcher would do so; and there was not enough concrete evidence to point the murder towards Fletcher. Therefore, Simon Fletcher is clearly an innocent man.
