Our company is committed to promoting equality in the workplace free from all forms of discrimination, including sexual harassment, by taking all reasonable measures to prevent such incidents and to deal promptly and fairly with any reports of sexual harassment in a confidential and discreet manner. Because of our company’s strong disapproval of offensive or inappropriate sexual harassment at work, all employees must avoid any action or conduct which could be viewed as sexual harassment. Where allegations of sexual harassment are substantiated, the offender will be sanctioned in strict accordance with this policy, regardless of his or her status at our company. And our company will in no case be tolerant of any sexual harassment incident.

Sexual harassment is distinguished into two forms.  Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, which means “this for that” or “something for something” and is typified by the first two conditions above.  Hostile Work Environment Sexual Harassment, which is typified by the third condition above.

Sexual harassment is prohibited under the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and will not be tolerated in our workplace.
