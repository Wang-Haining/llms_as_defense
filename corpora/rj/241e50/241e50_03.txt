Maria can be relied upon to accomplish the best possible work results. She is normally on time for meetings and appointments. However, Maria occasionally begins work late, and her attendance record has not always met the guidelines. On some occasions, she has taken time off without providing adequate notice. I suggest Maria to pay more attention to this factor and try her best to improve her attendance and punctuality records, which would definitely have impact on her job performance<Paste>

Alice meets many of the expectations in a satisfactory manner, but there are some areas that need to be improved. When Alice is fully engaged, she will be a positive contributor to the company. This is important for the success of both Alice and the company. I suggest meeting with Alice again in one month to determine whether her quantity level as well as attendance and punctuality records have improved.

I suggest Alice be trained in Access database, which would enable her to produce more meaningful and effective reports for the employees. This advancement would benefit both herself and the company. Alice should take a related class from an accredited school with full subsidy from the company on production of a certificate with grade “C” or above.
