Tobacco is one of the main causes of cancer and other diseases of the respiratory system. Governments around the world are carrying out different anti-smoking policies aimed at curbing their consumption in public places.
By curbing the consumption of tobacco in public places, such as coffee shops, nightclubs or concert halls and shows, many social smokers have given up their habit. Those people who only lit a cigarette as part of a social ritual when they went out for a beer with friends have quit smoking because they can not consume it on these occasions. On the other hand many young people began to get into this vice when visiting leisure places where it was normal to see many people smoking, now they do not have that bad example that could encourage them to consume cigarettes. All the statistics point to the fact that the number of smokers decreases every year and that this decrease has been noticed especially in those countries where the prohibitions are more severe.
The anti-smoking laws, together with the awareness campaigns of the ministries of health, have been very positive so that young people do not start smoking and those who already did leave that insane habit.
