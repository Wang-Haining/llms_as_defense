Talking about the right to death is still a thorny issue. Much of that has to do with conceptions of faith that speak of punishment and guilt, and of the lack of authority that we, as humans, have to decide on the lives of others. The will to die with dignity is compared to assisted murder, and to "play God". But God, faith, doctrine and sacred scriptures none of the religions should have weight on decisions that concern only the realm of the personal. To the beliefs of each one and to the right that each person has to decide how he wants to die.
If each one of us has the will to decide what kind of life he wants to lead, we must ask ourselves if we do not have the same decision autonomy to plan the way we want to die, of course, in the circumstances that merit it, as deep pain and suffering because of a disease.
The position in favor of "assisting the patient" if he wishes to end his life can be summarized in a single idea: freedom. The patient's freedom to be able to make the decision or not to stop their suffering. Those who are sick do not suffer alone, their family suffers with them, their friends, the spirit of everyone around them becomes sad and the only thing that everyone wants is for the person to get peace. Nobody wants to see a loved one in pain.
Those who argue against also affirm that life must be preserved, despite the conditions in which the person's health is found; But what kind of life is that of someone bedridden for years connected to thousands of machines to keep an artificial beat alive?
