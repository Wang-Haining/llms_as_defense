Every year many pets are abandoned by their owners. Many of them, when they grow up, stop being so funny and attractive and need more attention and space than they are willing to give them. In other cases, with the arrival of vacations, the owners are not interested in not paying their accommodation in a hostel.
There are two basic ways to fight against animal abuse. On the one hand, to make people aware that a pet is a living being that implies many responsibilities that they must know and assume before taking them home. On the other hand, convincing them to adopt and not buy will help all the abandoned animals to have a second chance to share their life with a family. In addition, animal shelters usually keep track of those pets that are adopted, which guarantees that they will be taken care of in the proper conditions. In these shelters there are specialists who advise on the most appropriate animal for the characteristics of each person or family, but if for any reason the animal and the owner do not adapt to each other within the set time, the protector becomes responsible again of the animal
Fighting against animal abandonment is everyone's job, only by making us aware that every living being has rights will we be able to achieve a more just society for them.
