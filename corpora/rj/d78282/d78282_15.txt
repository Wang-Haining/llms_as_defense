	The key to my creative growth is to not look down upon others that may have made bad choices or may be in a place that they do not want to be.  After all they are indeed human beings and have needs that need to be met like anyone else.  They also have strengths in places such as creativity or something that I can learn from.  The fact that everyone has something that you can learn from is amazing and by taking the time to learn from everyone we meet can change how we approach other people forever.  Now, of course you cannot learn things form people in passing but you can learn from those at work, at home, and in class.
	Watching Waste Land opened my eyes in the fact that there are many useful things out there and we should look for ways to use them even after we deem them trash or not needed anymore.  This can be applied to work circumstances like making something easier for someone by freeing up their time to do more higher cognitive things like strategize about the company or visit with family.  Looking outside of the box to solve most problems is probably a very good approach to keep myself innovative and ready to face anything that the day presents me with.
Conclusion
	The documentary shows us that people are indeed innovative from all walks of life and have the ability to create art and deserve our respect as another human being.  People need to be given a chance to succeed even if they have failed or seem unable to overcome obstacles that are in their way.  Art serves as that common platform of innovation because someone that was inspired to create it inspires to help someone else out through their own piece of work.  Vik and his entire team have a huge heart but none bigger than those pickers that are likely still working today to gather things that people in Rio throw away.  Learning from this short glimpse into their lives will serve all those that watch the documentary and myself better.
