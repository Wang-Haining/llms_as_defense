	I would want people to remember me by being that leader when it’s necessary but mostly that I was the person that never too anything too seriously unless it had to be.  I would want people to respect me and know that I’d be there when they need me with a smile on my face no matter what.  I think that people sometimes take things too seriously and need someone to come in and break the ice to make things more light while still getting to the bottom of whatever issue or situation.  I would also want people to know that I stick to my guns and believe that what I am doing is right and understand that.  Some words that would describe me would be honest, caring, respectful, funny, and loyal.
