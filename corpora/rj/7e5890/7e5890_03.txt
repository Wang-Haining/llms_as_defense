Another interesting use of the medium is the pixelated images and the flickering GIF that loops throughout the experience. The story is a conversation between a couple, where you find that the girlfriend has been unfaithful to her boyfriend, who just came back from war. The dramatic light effect created by the sharply contrasting black and white images paired with the flickering window GIF, feels like a close up and intimate talk during a storm or over candlelight.  Through these digital tools, along with the non-linear presentation of the narrative make web a very effective and interesting tool to have used to create this work.
