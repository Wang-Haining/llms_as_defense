Exiting the space through the nearest of those walkways brings the visitor into a quaint and cozy café space. Colorful table umbrellas and plentiful foliage make this area far more colorful than the rest of San Jose City Hall. Despite feeling secluded and cut off from the rest of the City Hall, it still feels secure and comfortable.
After a short walk around the ramp and past the parking garage, as a visitor turns to walk down 6th Street, the building exhibits firmitas more than ever. From this face, the smaller features are blocked, and only the massive building remains, a towering and imposing structure made up of strong rectangles and unmistakable as a government building. However, as one rounds the corner again onto Santa Clara Street, an odd arm of the building juts out and over the sidewalk. Perhaps this arm suggests that the City Hall is not only to intimidate the city’s residents, but also to help them.
All the way around, the San Jose City Hall is an interesting building that represents its city well. It’s strong and sturdy, beautiful and unified, and useful to workers, citizens, and passersby alike.
