As for this class, I think the photos I’ve shot here do fit with my other work. I’m not a photographer and thus didn’t have any photos in my portfolio previously, but the subjects and overall aesthetic are in line with my paintings and drawings. I found the class and the work a lot more enjoyable, interesting, and satisfying than I expected to too. I’m not sure how it will fit into my future, but photography is such a broad and useful skill that I’m certain it will be helpful in both my artwork and in other areas of my life, perhaps to create reference images, for photobashing, or even as a hobby.
