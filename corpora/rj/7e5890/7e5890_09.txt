The second floor was intended for as the living space of the Savoyes, consisting of the living room, their son’s room, and an area intended for the couple. This area was divided into four parts, which were the bedroom, bathroom, dressing room, and boudoir. The lower floor was mostly for the family’s workers, their maids, chauffeurs, and gardeners, and for practical use.  The two floors are joined by both a unique, smoothly winding spiral staircase and another ramp.
This simple piece of architecture might not be immediately impressive to most viewers unaware of its history or significance. However, after discovering that history, the international effort to save the building, its importance as a symbol of modern architecture, its reverence for the surrounding nature, and the way its simple elements are still present in present-day architecture, it’s hardly possible to not appreciate Villa Savoye and feel grateful toward Le Corbusier for both his ingenuity in its creation and his passion in securing its restoration.
