	Unlike the aforementioned continents, Africa and Asia have a plethora of attacks and fatalities as a result of terrorist strikes in both years, though they have seen a decrease.  In both years, Al-Qaeda is concentrated in the same areas (Afghanistan, Mali, Burkina Faso, Yemen, and Tunisia), though there are fewer scattered attacks throughout either continent.  There are fewer strikes by Al-Shabaab, and they are not spanning near as much of the coast as they did in 2017.   Those attacks committed by Boko Haram are now primarily around the eastern part of Nigeria (mostly limited to the area around Maiduguri) as opposed to being scattered across the country.  Attacks from the Islamic State have decreased greatly as well, but in 2018 they’ve committed more attacks in Mali than in 2017.  PKK changed the location of their attacks to being more concentrated around Syria and Mosul in 2018, but there are fewer that have occurred.  The number of attacks by Taliban actually increased from 2017 to 2018, which was surprising.  Those attacks are primarily in Afghanistan, but a few have been in Pakistan as well.

	In 2017, Al-Qaeda was responsible for fifty-six attacks and 367 fatalities and in 2018 they were responsible for thirty-eight attacks and 180 fatalities.  Al-Shabaab was responsible for eighty-two attacks and 1,074 fatalities, then sixty-nine attacks and 356 fatalities.  Boko Haram committed 111 attacks resulting in 758 fatalities, then seventy-two attacks resulting in 630 fatalities.  Islamic State perpetrated 467 attacks which resulted in 3,543 fatalities, then 246 attacks which resulted in 1,935 fatalities.  PKK was responsible for forty-six attacks and sixty-six fatalities, then twenty attacks and sixty fatalities.  Taliban was the only one to increase in attacks, having committed 141 attacks in 2017 with 1,245 fatalities and then 144 attacks in 2018 with 941 fatalities.  Other groups whose names are not listed committed a total of 444 attacks resulting in 1,224 fatalities in 2017, though in 2018 they committed 236 attacks with 474 fatalities.  Finally, unknown groups were responsible for twenty-three attacks and 162 fatalities, and thus far in 2018 they’re responsible for only six attacks with fifty-one fatalities.  This indicates that there’s a steady decline in the number of both terrorist attacks and fatalities that we see, as illustrated by the maps.
