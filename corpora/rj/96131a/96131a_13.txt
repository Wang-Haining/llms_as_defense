I think my favorite question was the last. I asked her what, if anything, she gained or enjoyed about doing this. I will let her answer speak for itself:
I reminded her that she doesn’t look and isn’t old, and that she can choose to maintain connections and activities. She spoke of her parents, and how she lost her mother to Alzheimer’s, and her dad to being a curmudgeon. She tearfully requested that I forgive her if she becomes old and cranky, and I told her I owe her at least that after my teens. I told her how much this meant to me, and how impressed I am with who she is. I promised her that I will keep asking questions, and will make sure that she is seen.
