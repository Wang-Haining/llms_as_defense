She mentioned two women whose careers she feels she influenced, both at the bank. In both cases, she encouraged them to reach for the positions that they really wanted and were capable of, noting the importance of encouraging mentors for women, especially in male-dominated contexts. When I described the five impression management behaviors in the book, she chuckled, and I didn’t expect her to have used any of them, and she said that she did not engage in impression management, but “I just did my job, and did it well, and was kind to others. I was responsible for myself.”
	I asked her about our discussion in class today, about increasing emphasis on personal identity and fulfillment through work, and she agreed, especially for her parents’ generations, when women rarely worked and thus found fulfillment in other roles. Generally, she thinks that there was more balance, “There was more free time. You had your hobbies. You didn’t expect to get complete fulfillment from your job. It was a means for the life you really wanted. ‘This will buy me my boat and hunting cabin’ or whatever you really wanted to do.” I wonder about this change and the implications for leisure crafting. Perhaps studying and promoting leisure crafting is a uniquely 21st century requirement, in that her parents’ generations may have done it intuitively.
