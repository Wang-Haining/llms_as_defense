The Exodus could have occurred somewhere between the 15th and 12th centuries BCE. It is thought to have started in the 12th, while the Egyptian and Hittite political systems collapsed. The simultaneous decline of two previously dominating empires provided the opportunity for the Israelites to lower Egypt and escape from Egypt into Canaan.
All three cultures described their chief gods by using the metaphor of the king. It indicates a similarity between the ways they explained the power of the God/gods and pictured the relationships between man and the God/gods. Although Israel's terminology was the same as the terms used in Egypt and Mesopotamia, the images which these terms represent were not always identical. In all the cultures, gods who were kings represented the highest power and the authority which had the greatest control, but the character, number and function of them were different. The authority of Yahweh is far greater than any of Egypt’s gods, as they shared their powers with the Pharaohs, or Mesopotamia’s gods, as all of them were equal. Biblical literature suggests that the kingship of Yahweh was important in developing a biblical theology of the Old Testament.
Their religions shaped their own cultures, and also impacted future cultures. Whether they are true or not, religions give people hope, and a reason to live a good life. All three cultures were significantly impacted by their religions.
