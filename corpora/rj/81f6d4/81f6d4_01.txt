        	According to Google.com, Google started as an idea under a completely different name, BackRub. BackRub was the start of something great between Larry Page and Sergey Brin. The search engine started in 1996; a year after Larry and Sergey met, and only lasted for a year. A year after BackRub, Google.com became a registered domain in the September 1997. A year later in September 1998, Google filed for incorporation in the State of California, and opened shop in the garage of Susan Wojcicki's house. Just a few months after in December, PC Magazine named Google.com as the search engine of choice of 1998. In the beginning of 1999, Google moved from the garage into an actual office space with only eight employees. In the coming months in 1999, Google expanded by moving into a bigger location a few miles away from Stanford University, Larry and Sergeyâ€™s alma mater. Larry and Sergey also hired their first company chef to cook healthy and clean food for the workers of Google. This was the start of Google providing food to their employees.
