	As technology keeps developing and future generations are becoming more connected to devices for communication, Google is creating new ways to make communication easier for their clients. Day by day, Google is coming up with ideas that will satisfy their customers and influence them to continue using their products rather than their competitors. Google likes to keep their employees long term, and that is why they offer them such amazing company benefits and provide care for their families, as well as not wasting money on new workers all the time and having continuity. Although Google is a great company to work for, one of their biggest weaknesses is that they have over skilled employees working for them and many voices are not being heard to do the amount of creativity in the room. Google, besides providing excellence service to its customers, also focuses a lot on the future generations and makes sure they are involved in their company working alongside workers to learn new skills. Google will continue to have a daily impact on a personâ€™s life because of the resources provided and navigation that makes their life much easier to take on.
