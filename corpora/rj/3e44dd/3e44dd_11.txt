	Revolutions are brought about by groups, but individuals make up those groups. Revolutions are influenced by internal and external factors, but it is the individuals living in a country that have to deal with those factors. A group has no vague central intelligence; the intelligence of a revolution is merely the combined intention of every person involved. Some people are smarter than others or better than others or more righteous than others, and the abilities of the people leading a revolution (or even just participating in one) will undoubtedly influence the course of that revolution. If one adheres to a purely structural view of revolution, it is easy to get so caught up in theory that one forgets that revolutions are just an aggregation of individual interactionsâ€”but if one can avoid this, it is clear that an individual actor and his or her abilities and desires can effect meaningful change.
