	Looking forward for new avenues to pursue in the question of what Shakspere’s role in the company looked like, we might instead turn to payments made for the plays themselves, which one might suspect would be more strongly connected to Shakspere himself if he were the playwright, rather than the company as a whole or its various members. In addition, interrogating contemporary descriptions of Shakspere as compared to descriptions of his fellow actors and other, competing playwrights might yield interesting results. Although this line of evidence did not make strong claims about Shakspere’s status, it continues to open questions about his relation to troupe members and how others viewed him during his life.
