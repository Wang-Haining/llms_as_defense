‘Fargo’ is a great film, I don’t think anyone’s denying this, but what is the theme behind it, why was it made. Sure, the simple answer, as with all movies, is it’s for entertainment. But I always think there’s a deeper meaning behind film, especially ones by great, high-profile directors. One way I looked at this film was pretty simple, keep working hard and good things will come to you. Sure, Jerry was working hard, but this massive downhill spiral started one he hatched his plan to sell stolen cars and then cheat money out of his wife’s father with the kidnapping. This series of events let to innocent people being killed and in the end, really nothing going right for Jerry in the slightest. Another way I looked at the film was more, grand scheme of things. How at a given time, any of us could be connected. For example, Jerry gets in touch with criminals in Fargo. They strike a deal. They then kidnap Jerry’s wife. That night they kill the three people. Marge is now in the picture investigating and tracking Carl and Gaear ,who have now killed people, while they’ve kidnapped Jerry’s wife, connecting all four in a big old roundabout way. Life is about who we are connected to in various ways shapes and forms. ‘Fargo’ is a film that lets us see how the connections we make in lie, through the people we meet and encounter can be a good or bad thing. You wouldn’t want to be close with known criminal, because then thing could become suspicious if things with them go south. Even worse though, having those connections with bad people could slows turn you into one of them yourself. Be like the hopeful, happy, Jerry we briefly see in ‘Fargo,’ not what he eventually turn into.
