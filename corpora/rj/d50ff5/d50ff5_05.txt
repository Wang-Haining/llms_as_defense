The use of music is another great point in 'Airplane!' Not only is the score fun and full of horns that accent a given scene, there's two other points that use sound to keep the viewer engaged. The first comes in the form of the flashback dance number between Ted and Elaine in a tavern. The dance number is fun and is choreographed very well. It also furthered the character development for Ted and Elaine respectively. Not to mention, this scene has some of best use of costumes in the film. From the girl scouts fighting, to Ted's pure white army costume, everything looked good in this scene. The other scene is the guitar scene. Where the talented stewardess encapsulates the plane with a lovely song, that also almost kills a girl in need of a heart transplant.
There's probably a higher reason, other than pure comedy, that 'Airplane!' was made, but I don't think I can pinpoint it. The first, and best, parody film of all time, is a riot from start to finish. The writing, directing, acting, humor and just about anything else you can think of, is perfect. If you're a fan of any type of comedy then this film is for you, because you will be laughing from start to finish in this film that still holds up exceptionally, even to this day.
