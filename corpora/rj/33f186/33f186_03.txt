On January 6th Chris from PCC had called into the Citrix presales line.  This customer had previously been in contact with his Citrix representative whom was configuring a Citrix Netscaler solution for him.   Unfortunately Chris was quite upset when calling in, claiming that the representative had then informed him that he would not be able to get back to him within a week.  Luckily, Robert, a member of our Citrix presales team helped him acquire the proper solution.  Instead of just telling the customer that it will be another week, I would suggest informing the Citrix representatives to notify their customers of Ingramâ€™s presales support in the event that they are busy.  This would create a much better customer experience and grow that relationship between Citrix, the VAR and Ingram Micro to a much greater degree.

During the month of January Ingram Micro technical support began receiving questions on Xenapp Fundamentals 6.0.  Some of these questions we were unable to research the answers due to lack of documentation.  Although we did obtain the answers for these questions, due to not having the information ahead of time created a less than optimal experience for the customer.  My team and I would be able to better position newer products better, provide answers faster, and ultimately create more sales by obtaining new product information ahead of time.
