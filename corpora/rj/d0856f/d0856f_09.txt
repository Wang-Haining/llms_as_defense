The pesticide is another such innovation. While pesticides come under fire today for environmental ill effects, there is no denying that we simply wouldn’t be able to feed the population of the world today without them. Pesticides made farming over 200% more efficient than they were before. Even with modern pesticide resistance and improvements in organic farming techniques, it simply wouldn’t be possible to grow enough food for everyone the old-fashioned way without having a lot more farmland. Again, a farmer who saw this kind of night and day drastic improvement on their farm is going to start looking forward to the next innovation in farming technology to make their lives easier and their farms more efficient than the day before. How did you see the universe? You couldn’t wait to see what it would bring you tomorrow.

The lives of all of those farmers sure changed drastically because of technology. But often, technology changed to suit the lives of those farmers as well. It is unlikely that the middle ages would’ve seen the development in agriculture it had if Rome had never fallen. They say necessity is the mother of all invention. While that is not always true, it is certainly true when it comes to the lives of these farmers. Agricultural invention was not common during the Roman Empire when it wasn’t necessary, but once things changed, agriculture inventions began to arrive.
