	Because price fixing is per se illegal, that same standard was applied here. The Final Judgment outlined many rules by which Playmobil had to abide. There were many stipulations to the judgment, interesting among them are that Playmobil was unable to hear complaints about pricing from one retailer regarding another. Also, Playmobil was also unable to create any legal or illegal suggested price structure. This would seem to be to allow the market set the price, not the distributor as in a command market. Another interesting was the responsibility of Playmobil to inform its dealers of the Judgment.
	It seems, in my opinion, that the decision in the case did not set precedent. This is because the precedent of per se rulings on price fixing cases had already been established. I feel that the Final Judgment was appropriate, it did not inhibit Playmobil from functioning as a company and it may even create a larger market for the toys. As an interesting note, my fianc√©e and I purchased some Playmobil toys at clearance prices for my stepson for Christmas, and I remember remarking to her what a good deal they were and that when I was growing up Playmobil were considered by my parents to be elite and expensive toys. It seems as if the ruling is still having effect on the toys to great benefit of my step-son, Edison.
