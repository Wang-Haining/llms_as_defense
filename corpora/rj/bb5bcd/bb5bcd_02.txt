I think that my travel tasks should mimic tasks in the office – those tasks that involve project development and those that involve gaining customer base and improving relations. I think this includes occasional visits to Israel. During the last visit, David and I briefly mentioned bi-annual trips as being a strong positive in continuing good relations with revolving staff. These may not need be two weeks trips, in the end, but I think that there is value in considering this. I also DO WANT to participate in trade shows – the series of constant events preventing this has been considerably frustrating to me too. I am working on preventing these coincidences from occurring. To help me, understanding the shows we intend to represent ourselves at is important – a list of web resources for planning would be ideal.
I think that these people should have these more specific tasks as their priority. This is not These address projects and concerns, but don’t intend to be separate from the above sections:
I would like to pass this to him officially on August 31. I would like to set aside two days to train him on the operation and the code. Additionally, I would like to share with him the areas for advancement.
I would like to refine this plan with you first. Then present a version of this to Ali – without some of the specific resource notes – for his input. He has some tenure with us and I think deserves his comments to be understood and appreciated.
I would then like to have our first in service day in early August to present this plan to the office and offer some initial training concepts.
