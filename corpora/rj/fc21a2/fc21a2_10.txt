Mad Men is a sophisticated show that fictional characters who give the audience a modern analysis of the 1960s, a decade that saw a growing distrust of the United States Government as well as the deterioration of the fantasy that was the 1950s “American Dream”. Don Draper is easily the face of the American man of the 1960s; though he worked hard to become rich and successful, he realized that the American Dream was not fulfilling and internalizes all of his emotions with lies and alcohol. He’s a fifties man trying to succeed in a new decade, despite having trouble changing his outdated mindset. The show also tackles many of the problems the United States was facing at the time: health, sexism, racism, and the Vietnam War. We see the negative effects of drinking and smoking, two topics that Mad Men was criticized for sensationalizing. The unfair treatment of women, minorities, and homosexuals is also shown, and Matt Wiener does not hold back from showing the ugly truths. The commentary on the Vietnam War as especially well done by Mad Men. Through the war, Americans saw many questionable decisions and injustices from the government, leading to a strong distrust that we can even see in the present time. As a whole, Mad Men is a great way to view the sixties through a modern lens. The show, while seeming complicated at first, is actually very entertaining to watch. Matthew Weiner knows how to show serious moments in history through the eyes of his characters while still having witty and entertaining dialogue. It’s brilliance is why Mad Men is one of the best shows on television.
