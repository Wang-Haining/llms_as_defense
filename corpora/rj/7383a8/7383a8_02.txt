	A natural scientist could collect evidence and do experiments to determine if GMO crops and plants affect natural plants directly. This would allow a natural scientist to determine if the hypothesis will be supported or refuted. I believe that the better evidence and more experiments you can conduct on a hypothesis, allows for a better outcome. My hypothesis was that genetically modified plants and crops can crossbreed with natural plants and crops and cause the natural plants to be modified. I wanted to test my hypothesis by bringing different genetically modified plants and having them crossbreed with natural plants to see the effects. For me to investigate if a plant is modified I would have to conduct a technique called the polymerase chain reaction. My investigation led me to find out that PCR is used to determine the presence of genetically modified sequences. I could check the natural plants DNA by using gel electrophoresis that would pull the DNA through a gel matrix. This separates the different sizes of bands of DNA that correspond to modified and non-modified markers. You can then compare these bands to the genetically modified plants bands. This testing would allow me to see if GMO plants can directly affect a natural plants ability to stay GMO free. This investigation can help individuals who do not want to consume GMO products, and for companies who label their products as organic, and GMO-free. This shows that natural plants can be crossbred with GMO plants, and there is a way to investigate this occurrence.
	My message is that natural plants and crops should be routinely checked for genetically modified indicators. This will help regulate how GMO plants can crossbreed with natural plants and organic crops. There are ways to test these plants which is a great start. Now all we need to do is push for this change. I hope that my audience can see my viewpoint, and understand why this is important to me.
