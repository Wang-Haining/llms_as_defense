	Although these two novels give equally excellent examples of the absurd philosophy, they differ quite a bit in point of view. In The Stranger, we have Meursault; the definition of the absurd man. He lives life according to his senses and does not put much thought into his actions. When he does put thought into something, or tries to explain something he says or does, his reasoning is very simplistic. Future consequence does not play a part in his decision making as the reader witnesses when he continues to shoot the Arab, or when speaking bluntly to someone disregarding their feelings. In contrast The Fallâ€™s main protagonist, Clamence is the polar opposite on the absurd spectrum. Unlike Meursault, He is a member of the mainstream society. His morals and ethics are intact. They are tainted and hypocritical, but nonetheless intact. The story follows him as he becomes aware of the absurd predicament of the human condition late in his life. He begins to see the hypocrisy in everything he does and this in turn cast him into a downward spiral from which he does not recover. On one hand Meursault chooses to embrace the absurdity in all the details of life and as a result dies happily for it. As his death will be a testament to the hypocrisy that plagues the existence people call living. On the other Clamence will live out the rest of his life in regret for a past life of duplicity painfully aware of the absurd, but unable to break his hypocritical routine. They are both victims of absurdity and when compared, they serve as markers in the evolution of the absurd.
