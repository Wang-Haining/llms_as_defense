From the beginning of the stranger we are introduced to Meursault’s absurd emotionally detached way of thinking,

(The stranger), you would think something as important as your mother’s death would be considered a flashbulb memory, in that you could easily recall all the details of the situation, instead we the reader are met with emotional indifference and isolation from the rest of society’s sentimental values. This is a clear sign of Meursault’s absurdism and is the common theme throughout the stranger. Alone the stranger seems to be a story of an idiot who lacks enough common sense for self-preservation, but with a little context we will see that this is a view of the world through the eyes of an absurdist, which is the clear culprit for Meursault’s lack of ethics and morais and the cause of Meursault’s abstract thought process.

In the stranger Meursault seem to live his life without perception and seems to purely rely on sensation; he is solely driven by how he feels, When attending Maman’s funeral he cannot bring himself to see Maman one last time because what would be the point.

Meursault agrees to lure the mistress to Raymond’s by way of writing a romantic letter, completely overlooking the consequences that could follow; more evidence of absurd reasoning or lack of. When the plan works and Raymond is caught physically assaulting his mistress by a police officer and the rest of the neighborhood; Meursault included, Meursault still continues to befriend Raymond and even testifies on Raymond's behave.  Although, I cannot see Meursault participating in this type of behavior he clearly has no notion on the way a man should conduct himself which shows a lack of ethics, he passes no judgment on Raymond one way or another,
