Further, Huerta’s choice of words also reflect the sentiment of uniting the Chicano/as into one solid movement and extend her bias. Words and phrases like “We, the striking grape workers of California,” or “as we plan, we recall the footsteps that brought us to this day,” and “For we are in the midst of a great social movement, and we will not stop struggling ‘til we die, or win!” give a sense of this being everyone’s fight. It gives a sense of empowerment to the strikers as well as a sense of hope, purpose and motivation. Huerta becomes the embodiment of the movement and the people give her a hero status, further adding to her influential role in the movement. Huerta’s bias and the bias of the workers are reflected in the use of the words “we” and “us” but it serves as another way to unite the Chicano for a common cause.
Even though this document is clearly biased, it still adds valuable insight into the Civil Rights Movement. While it is not an entirely reliable source, it still provides invaluable clues to how many Mexican Americans felt and thought as they started (and continued) their journal to obtaining civil rights for working Chicano striving for fair working conditions on grape farms in 1969.
