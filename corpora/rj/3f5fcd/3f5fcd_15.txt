Overall I stand by my analysis. The damage dealt to the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was irreversible. Although this method may not of worked, because the Japanese did not surrender after the first bomb was dropped on their city, actually seeing the bomb get dropped may of changed their ideas, which makes me stand by my decision.
I think that overall the most important things I learned was primarily just what went on. I knew that the United States had dropped bombs, but I didnâ€™t know all the details as to what the bombs where called and the conditions that they faced. This was a very informative way to learn about this topic.
