    The cause of US intervention was most likely not out of concern for the people or the country, although some people may of felt some concern for the people, i’m sure it was not the reason for intervention. Vietnam was not a main exporter of anything very important, as their main exports seem to consist of agricultural products. Because of this the United States would not see the Vietnamese country as a country to save from an uprising, as they do not see any personal benefit. Although when they see it may become communist, they’re intrigued and scared. They do not want Vietnam to become communist, not only because of their contempt for communism, but because they’re afraid if Vietnam becomes a communist country, then others will follow, bringing up the Domino theory.
    Also the country of Vietnam had little importance to the United States. If it was a country like Mexico, bordering the US then certainly they would of been quick to intervene. But as Vietnam is all the way on the other side of the world, generally staying out of any contact with the United States, they most likely didn’t feel the pressure to intervene. The reason for this was most likely that it was on a completely different side of the globe, had generally different inhabitants, and honestly wasn’t too important of a country.
