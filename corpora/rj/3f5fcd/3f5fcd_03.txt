    This semester I really wanted to get a handle on my financial situation and create a budget. I did well, and made some progress, but I found it difficult to stay on track. Something that helped me a lot was getting a new job near the end of the journaling which increased my budget. Although my results were mostly positive i’m overall disappointed with my results because I was unable to take it super seriously and make something positive happen. I think now my health is at like a 5. I mostly think about health as physical and socially and spiritually and mentally I may be lacking a little. I’m not very happy with my present health now, and hope to continue improving every year. In 10 or 20 years I hope I’m healthier than I am now even though i’ll be older. I definitely recommend this class to other people because even though it's kind of like alright.. sometimes it brings a lot of stuff to your attention that is very important to your health and you can think about.
