Haydn lived through and helped contribute to an extraordinary period for the cultivation of symphony orchestras. In this 18th century, the instruments used went from just string to horns, oboes clarinets, and more. He also went from writing three movement symphonies to four movement symphonies, as the three movement custom disappeared. In the 19th century the boundaries of symphony orchestras were being expanded by Beethoven. He even wrote a five movement symphony. Others too kept find new and creative ways to expand the boundaries of symphony orchestras, and continued to add new and more instruments to the orchestra. Throughout the twentieth century symphonies underwent even further creative expansion in the style and content of the symphonies being written.
Mozart began as a child prodigy and composed at a young age, whereas Beethoven mostly focused on mastering his skill at the instruments at a young age. Beethoven was almost seen as the successor of Mozart, mostly because of his career taking off soon after Mozart had passed away.

Gershwin always tried to incorporate jazz like effects in his music. This gave it a very unique sound, and flair. It is said that he bridged the gap between popular and art music. Due to the artful nature of his music, but also the flair and jazz it was hard for him not to stand out. He very much liked the works of some classical composers.
