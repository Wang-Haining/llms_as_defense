It is proposed that as a new marketing tactic, S&A have t-shirts and hats created for distribution to clients and subcontractors to be used as wearable advertising.

A critical component of S&Aâ€™s marketing strategy is through the development and implementation of a new website. A proposal for the new website and digital marketing strategy was delivered on 18 December 2018 and is approved. It is attached here as Appendix B. Website spending in 2018 totaled $3,108.55, and moving forward will be greatly reduced with projected costs for 2019 of $208, a total savings year over year of $2,900.55. These savings will be rolled over into the proposed hiring of a professional branding photographer and drone videographer for $3,000 in 2019.

In 2019, it is proposed that recruiting activities will fall under the umbrella of marketing which will include job fairs and job placement ads on hiring website. Recruiting activities in 2018 totaled $3,117.45 and with growing social media platforms and ever-emerging no-fee job placement boards, the 2019 proposed budget for recruiting has been reduced to $1,160 which will include 3 university level job fairs.

In 2019, it is proposed that company culture activities will fall under the umbrella of marketing which will include company parties and events, office potlucks and lunch meetings, and employee gifts. Company culture items in 2018 totaled $6,172.58 and with cost savings in many other areas of the marketing strategy, the company culture tactic will be a key driver to employee retention, motivation, and satisfaction, and will translate to client satisfaction with the firm.

For 2019, the proposed Company Culture budget is $9,300.08, an increase of $3,127.50 from the previous year. This will include 2 out of office company parties for employees and family (summer and winter), quarterly apparel purchases for all employees, and monthly in-office gatherings through potlucks, pizza days, donuts, or other activities.

The proposed marketing budget is contained in Appendix C, with a 2018-2019 comparison in Appendix D. The proposed marketing budget, once approved, will be reviewed quarterly by the Marketing Administrator and adjusted to reflect budgeted vs.  actual totals. This will ensure the budget is adhered to and that adjustments can be made with ownership approval as needs arise.
