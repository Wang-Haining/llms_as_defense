I am excited to be applying for the Sales Development Representative position at ArchiveSocial.  As someone with a strong history of driving product sales, managing client relationships, and substantially increasing revenues, I am eager for the opportunity to bring my unique blend of business development skills to your team.

During my previous role at Smith & Associates, I was responsible for collaborating with the leadership team to develop a lead generation and follow up process to create opportunities for new business. I was tasked with championing all business development efforts for the engineering firm, and was able to achieve a 50% year-over-year increase in proposals submitted to clients and 32% increase in new business for the firm.

With several years of experience as a business development professional, I understand what it takes to provide innovative solutions to close new deals, maintain and nurture sustaining relationships with existing clients, and reach or exceed targets and goals. I have been recognized for my communication style and ability to relate to clients across a variety of backgrounds.
