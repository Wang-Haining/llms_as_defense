I am excited to be applying for the Accounts Manager position at Brynn Marr Hospital. Assomeone with a strong history of successful marketing initiatives across a wide range of industries, I am eager for the opportunity to bring my unique blend of marketing skills to your team.

During my position at Smith & Associates, I was responsible for developing a new business role for a Marketing Specialist by creating a focused marketing plan with monthly and quarterly targets. As part of the plan, I drafted and proposed a FY2019 budget for the firm, with a proposed cost savings of 5% over FY2018 while increasing marketing efforts through more efficient means. I also proposed, designed, developed, and launched a new client-facing website for the firm based on Wordpress for easier updates and maintenance in the future.

With several years of experience as a marketing professional, I understand what it takes to provide innovative solutions to reach or exceed targets and goals. I have been recognized for my communication style and ability to relate to others across a variety of backgrounds.
