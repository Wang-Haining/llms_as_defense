Since our eventful journey to become Mainers we have found more and more to love about Maine. John has worked side jobs from paving to house painting and I worked a stint as a Production Manager at a local seafood company. After an emotional decision to leave a job I loved due to disagreements with the owner over what my employees should be paid, one woman who worked 30 years for their company made $13/hr, I decided to work on a business that John mentioned she was interested in starting. Those are the humble beginnings of Down East
Maids!

John brings data analytic experience stemming from a passion for all things numbers, 4 years worth of marketing study at Seattle University, and a wealth of sales knowledge from her years as a Realtor. Alice’s experience is a little more eclectic! Years in customer service, production work, and finally production management have given her a deep appreciation for the people who do the jobs most of the population doesn’t want to do and the daily struggles that come from working jobs like gas station attendant, call center representative, and seafood grading.  We are passionate about treating our employees well, providing the best service in the area, and getting to know all the people that make Maine great. We are so happy that you have looked into our business enough to make it through this much reading! Hopefully we have stressed enough how much we care about our employees and growing a financially responsible manner that benefits, most importantly, our employees and customers.

You made it this far! Now go give our 60 second booking a try!
