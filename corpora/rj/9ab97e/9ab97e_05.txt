Robots are either going to save humanity or destroy it.  It all depends on what book you read.  Each text weaves an intricate tale of redemption, loss, faith, chaos, fear, and hope.  In I, Robot there was the underlying fear that the Machines would find a way to take over, despite The Three Laws, thus the groupings of humans against all machines.  In The Eternal Enemy, the cyborgs have become humanoid thanks to the implantation of central nervous systems.  They have been programmed to relieve human suffering (does this sound familiar?).  However, to them, this means ending the human race because to be human is to suffer.  If to be human is to suffer then according to Asimov it is a robotâ€™s duty to alleviate the suffering.  Of course, this is all a moot point.  After all, it is science fiction.
