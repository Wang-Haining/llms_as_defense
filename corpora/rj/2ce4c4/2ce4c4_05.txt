This is a prime example of a historical occurance that would create a deep mistrust in the colored community regarding health care. African American women weren't the only group targeted with these "Mississippi appendectomy" procedures either. 10 This stretched across cultures and affected a large number of women in the Latina community as well.
There seems to be a vast level of miscommunication to this day.
It seems pretty clear to me that a deep level of cultural awareness, training in historical racism and healthcare, and an emphasis on clear communication and empathy could help mitigate the repercussions that this deep mistrust could cause. A lack of communication between doctor and patient, as well as a lack of trust, leads to errors in the diagnostic and treatment process. It is vital to patient care that these issues be resolved for a clearer understanding of patients and their care.
There is an incredibly long list of sources at the end of this article. The author uses a vast array of varying types of sources, including periodicals, medical journals, etc. I feel that this really shows that a lot of research and thought was put into the article. It sounded very well informed, educated and informative, and the ethos built by that extensive list of of sources really supports that conclusion for me. It is further proof that this is a deeply factual piece of rhetoric.
