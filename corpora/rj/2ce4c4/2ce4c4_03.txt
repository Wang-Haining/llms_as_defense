These programs are invaluable in providing education, access to treatment and education resources, as well as helping decrease new infections in HIV and Hepatitis C. Not only are they providing a massive public health benefit, they are also contributing to public safety by keeping used syringes off the streets. Lastly, these programs are paying for themselves and even saving counties money, because they are preventing new infections in intravenous drug users, which in turn is decreasing the amount states are paying for life time treatment of these disease. More states and counties need to implement these programs and provide access to addicts. Syringe Exchanges are extremely beneficial to both the economy and public health.
