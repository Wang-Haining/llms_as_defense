Traditional advertising methods included printed advertisements, such as in newspapers or magazines. Additionally, traditional advertisements could include: billboards, posters on the backs of benches, or ads on the sides of busses. These types of advertising methods are beneficial when marketers are targeting consumers who may not frequently utilize technology. This could include older individuals, who are not particularly tech savvy, or may not know how to use a computer or smart phone at all. They may even prefer to get their news through newspapers, rather than watching television. Additionally, while many younger individuals may not read newspapers or magazines, it is sometimes impossible to avoid viewing a public billboard or poster, particularly while walking down the street or if one is stuck in traffic. Traditional advertisements have the potential of reaching different types of consumers, but it seems that they are most affective in targeting those who are less reliant on technology.
