	At its most basic, Margaret Cavendish’s The Blazing World advocates for the author’s philosophy that the irregularity of nature is something inherent that makes it such an important and complex force. In equating nature with the topic of female rule, Cavendish takes a strong stance against the misogynist ideology that permeated the time period in which she lived. By supporting a consistent dialogue throughout the story, the author presents a philosophical approach that she considers more reliable than scientific observation. Rather than relying on an established system, she embraces the variety in nature, whilst simultaneously supporting the idea of resisting any propensity to desire change while in any position of authority. The Blazing World is a story that is rich with information and one that, while possibly unfairly judged too critically by Cavendish’s contemporaries, remains a considerable literary achievement deserving of careful study to this day.
