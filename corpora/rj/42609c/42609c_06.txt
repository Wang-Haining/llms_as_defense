Independent female film directors have found the small niche of female directed movies to be more to their liking then previously thought.  Because there is such a marginalization when it comes to female directors, those who have ventured into the realm of directing have found that they have a place and a decent amount of success in the indie film circles.  Jodie Foster, Barbara Streisand, Goldie Hawn, Allison Anders, Nancy Savoca, and many others have found their way into directing movies in the indie scene, even though Foster, Streisand and Hawn were all actresses as well in many commercial hits.
Indie films, while not the moneymaking blockbusters that Hollywood is content to continuously churn out, are successful because people donâ€™t always want Hollywood blockbusters, but want seething that challenges them and makes them think.  They are a place for those who have been marginalized in mainstream Hollywood  to make their own impact.
