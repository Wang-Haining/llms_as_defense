Horror movies do not have this kind of effect on the characters or the audience.  Whereas horror movies’ primary goal these days is to shock and disgust with no deep or complex plot, the thriller aims to make the audience think about an issue.  Saw does this quite well, and while it is highly violent with a massive amount of blood and grotesque dead bodies, it also leaves the audience pondering on the value of life.  Horror movies are mindless hack and slash films and Saw does not, under these circumstances, fall into this category.
The idea of being chained to a pipe with the only hope for escape being a bonesaw does not sit well with everyone.  For the squeamish person with the weak stomach, I wouldn’t recommend this movie.  But for anyone who can look past gore and see the complex plot beneath, I would encourage to give the first movie in the Saw franchise a try.  Prepare to be shocked and disgusted, but also to be disturbed and left with a deep question about the value of human life.
