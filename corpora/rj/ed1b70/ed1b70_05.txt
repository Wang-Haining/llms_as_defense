The differences between Mickey’s deviant behaviour and that of Sol and Vinny illustrates that not all deviant behaviour can be explained in the same way. The circumstances that led to Mickey’s deviance were far different from those that led to Sol and Vinny’s deviance. Their motivations, as well as the actions themselves, vary wildly even between several characters in the same movie. The reality is that there is a tremendous range of deviant activity, and an even bigger range of motivations which lead people to such behaviours. Because of this fact, there is no one cohesive theory of all deviance; rather, there are a range of theories which each shed light on different deviant behaviours and the situations from which they arise.
