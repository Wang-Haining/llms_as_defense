Luckily, Zazen can be practiced by any religion, race, and persons of any health condition to the betterment of not only the existence to those that do it, but also as a boon their both their mental and physical health. Unfortunately, this is a very new concept to the western world. It will take time for it to become an acceptable mainstream treatment option. Every study that can be found touts its benefits: That is the astounding part of this research.  Zen definitely has a place in the future of mental health in the United States as well as the world. Where it really could outshine current standards is in the pre-treatment of school aged children.  Zazen is an effective intervention in the treatment of physiologic, psychosocial, and behavioral conditions among youth. Due to the fact that it can be secular in nature, zazen could easily be the one element that could be brought into school curriculum throughout the country to the advantage of all youth. This form of treatment is greatly effective, very cost efficient, easy on the patients, and has absolutely no adverse side-effects. No matter age, condition, social or economic standing, or race, Zazen is one of the most potent mental health facilitators that exists. All it needs to become the miracle drug of this generation is a few wise and daring souls to promote it. It is an easy theory to state as a fact: If the entire world would just sit Zazen and have some tea, we would all have a better place to live. And we would all be a bit healthier mentally.
