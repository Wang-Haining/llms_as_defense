In medieval Europe, guild workers served as the social association between craft and business to ensure that the quality of their product meets the expectation of the rest of society. First according to dictionary.com, the term "guild" is defined as any of various medieval associations, as of merchants or artisans, organized to maintain standards and to protect the interests of its members, and that sometimes constituted a local governing body. Guild workers come in many forms, the Merchant Guilds is made up by a group of individuals that were formed in around many medieval towns to protect commerce and related industries whom were outside of the scope of the feudal system; they were responsible to govern the economic situation of the region by forming alliances that would later make them important actors in the government role. The other types of guilds we're focused on the crafting quality of products, these workers ensured the quality of production at the most basic level; in a sense they served as managers by integrating different classes to their work in order to efficiently create a monopoly-like basis of power. These guilds served as a productive member of society during medieval times because it was one of the few ways that individuals could excel their work to increase the quality of their work. In the book "The Drama of Masculinity and Medieval English Guild Culture", the author proceeds to explain that the 'mystery plays' of the medieval English guilds shared the same masculinity as the Christian theology, modes of devotion, and civic self-consciousness because many of these skilled merchants and craftsmen we're motivated by Biblical envisionment that created the quality of work we are familiar with today. The author then proceeds to mention that during those times, there was no entry for either "women" or "female workers" in the guild world; that is because women in those times practiced a separate lesser form of trade that boosts their husband's crafts. In conclusion, guilds played an important role in society during medieval times in European towns; that is, they were predominantly responsible to ensure the quality of the craft and trade among regions by also creating a unified order that would act as an organization that governs quality standards therefore allow the workers to create a monopoly like structure along the region to maximize their political domination over a region.
