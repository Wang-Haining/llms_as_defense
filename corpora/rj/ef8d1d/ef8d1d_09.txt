Over the last two decades, our dependency on fossil fuels and other high energy sources have consumed our society by shifting demand from lesser oils used for heating to much intensified versions that have the potential to generate power and act as a fundamental part of our culture. However, the underlying problem we are to face as a society today is finding the ultimate method to sustain our high demand for energy in order to protect our culture from repeating the same mistakes other civilizations have faced before ultimately reaching a point of entropy; where no return to the previous methods of consumption can be achieved. This has resulted in an ever-lasting exploration to find the ultimate renewable source of energy that has the capacity to accommodate for a continuous electrical application while still promoting development. Now that the age of conventional energy production has reached its peak in output, it has become our objective to divert from current fossil-fuels and nuclear power plants whom have been proven to directly impact the local environment for mechanical processes to create energy. These carbon-free sources of power generations have been long existing as part of our history, and the development of such sources has been hidden in plain sight by ancient civilisations such as the Greek and their Roman counterparts whom absolutely managed to perfect these technical advances through processes to meet the demand for an increased competency. These so-called inventions weâ€™re used not to generate electricity but for their technological operations such as the Greek watermill used for breaking down grains, and the construction of aqueducts for the directing of stormwater and other wastewater systems. For this discussion, the potential capacity of water will be discussed in depth and the conversion of this energy source into producing hydroelectric power will be analysed as a current possibility while also addressing many relative factors such as the sequencing of the process and its conceivable feasibility as an alternative national source.
