For this week’s assignment on alternative energy sources, the viability of biomass will be broken down to the basic categorical sections that make up such process a feasible source that can be converted to magnify the typical related uses for energy. The reason behind this availability of such energy source is highly conventional due to the simple nature of sunlight being directly converted into a form of glucose that can often hold a relatively high chemical energy with the ability to be reused again through a controlled and refined process. First, this energy will be broken down to its basic premise and the production methodology behind such a process before it eventually becomes part of the electrical grid networks. Then, the energy source will be evaluated throughout a process that distinguishes the conveniences behind such production in order to evaluate the receptiveness of such development in the modern world including the pros and cons that are often associated with the conversion of biomass to energy. Last but not least, the energy source will be reviewed through the respective feasibility of converting such energy source into a useable form of power through generation that can later possess a high energy capacity in the world of electricity; this will also include a comparison to other primary sources currently found throughout the conventional market for it’s consumption and commercial use.
