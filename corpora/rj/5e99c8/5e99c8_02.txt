	I am literate, creative, and eager to share what I have learned.  Though I have improvements to make in these areas, I am well spoken and able to write well.  I have some experience on AVID non-linear editing systems, including DS and Symphony, as well as Final Cut.  I also have some amateur experience with photography and dark rooms.  I also have some experience in breaking down scripts, choosing and setting up shots, lighting, and set construction.
	There have been several times, especially in the past year, when I had to work with a group of people on a project, but I would like to describe one where the outcome was not good, because I learned the most from it.  During our final project at Full Sail, a 35mm short, I was chosen to be one of three directors. I was the only female of the three, and quickly found out that despite all my idealism and naiveté, men and women tend to deal with problems in different manners.  More importantly, I learned that one has to deal with people on their terms, whether or not one feels that those terms are the best way to deal. I discovered that different things are important to different people, and what is most important in the end is that the project is completed, and completed well; who did what to cause which problems doesn’t matter, sorting out differences, credit, blame, praise, and feelings should never take up time that can be dedicated to working towards the common goal. One’s own personal feelings about other people, circumstances, and everything else, are always secondary to the goal.  Probably the most important lesson I learned was that a positive attitude is one of the most powerful and important tools one can wield, and it is necessary for both leaders and crewmembers to always maintain this.
