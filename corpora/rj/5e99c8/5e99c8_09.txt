	The final example of Mersault's social rebellion lies at the end of the book, where it is revealed that his last hope is to be surrounded, not by a crowd of loving supporters as he is put to death, but by a large group of hateful faces to jeer him to his
demise.  He does not seek forgiveness or love from his final moments with his fellow man.  It is in defiance of humanity that he desires to be hated, for no one wants to be hated by those he loves.  It is a rebellion against life and all that society seeks to perpetuate.
	Mersault's heedlessness of society's opinion reflects a deep rooted inner revolt towards the common institution.  He will not recognize the relevance of society's values.  His opinions, behavior, and feelings are a revolt against society, even to the point of his death.
