	Chalmers' setup can be altered to address this very similar problem of whether two people can see the same colors as different. Imagine that in a future laboratory, Sheila's brain is studied until we know exactly what parts of her brain are responsible for color perception. We then find the analogous parts in Sam's brain, take them out, and put Sheila's areas in, connecting every single synapse exactly as it should be connected, and ask Sam if red still looks like red. Or, if the laboratory is futuristic enough, we don't even need to remove the areas from Sheila's brain, we instead put microscopic radio transmitters in every synapse of the color areas of Sheila's brain to transmit directly to the analogous synapses in Sam's brain, and like Chalmers' setup, construct a switch to turn the radio transmitters on or off, so that we can control whether Sam is perceiving colors with parts of his brain, and with the corresponding parts of Sheila's brain (it is important to note that we do this only with the small portion of the brain that does color processing, and not the whole brain, otherwise flipping the switch would just be doing a body transplant between Sheila and Sam). Also following Chalmers' setup, we monitor both their brains for changes, and whenever a change occurs in the color areas of Sheila's brain, a similar change will be made to occur in the analogous areas of Sam's brain, and visa versa. If the brains are physically similar, the results of their firings should be physically similar, and so we would expect that when we flip the switch back and forth, Sam will say he sees the same color from second to second, and all other behavior will suggest that he does.
