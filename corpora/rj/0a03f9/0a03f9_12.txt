A second formative assessment I will use to measure student progress is the recording sheet for Grab and Count: Ordering. This activity requires that students grab four different colored handfuls of connecting cubes, count the quantities, and then order the quantities from least to greatest. Students then record their work on a recording sheet that requires that they color the cubes in order from least to greatest. This requires that they can represent the quantities they counted accurately, and it also demonstrates whether they have accurately ordered from least to greatest (from left to right). As with most activities during this unit, this activity will be completed on more than one day, so that results can be tracked to see if progress is being made or if students are struggling, or if most have clearly mastered the material.
Blank copies of the record keeping system have been attached separately. I have attached them as both a PDF visual of what they look like and the spreadsheet version. They are three different spreadsheet files, one for each learning goal, and their corresponding pre-assessments/post- assessments and formative assessments and dates. Students who are not meeting the objectives on any given day will have their cells highlighted in yellow. In this way I can easily track which columns are indicating that many students are having a lot of problems with a specific dayâ€™s objective, and I can also track individual students who have many boxes of yellow in their rows. This will also allow me to have a visual of which learning goals are being met more than others when I compare the different recording spreadsheets for each learning goal.
