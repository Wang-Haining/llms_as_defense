A quality of both art and humanity is that no two people view things in exactly the same way. Based on the instances above, the same holds true when it comes to crimes, legal and moral, that are committed by an artist. Some simply have no interest in the artist and will enjoy the work on its own merits. Some find themselves unable to enjoy an artist’s work if the artist has done things that one finds disturbing. Some combine the two, enjoying the art while taking into consideration what the artist has done, in the hopes of discovering insight or perspective. Whether someone separates the art from the artist or not, it is clear that these situations are ripe for debate and discussion.
