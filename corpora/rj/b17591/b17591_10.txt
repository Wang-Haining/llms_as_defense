Though ethical dissonance is an aversive psychological state that may not manifest a physiological response, ethical dissonance may, in certain situations, counteract the motivations to be dishonest. Further, if people experiencing ethical dissonance and moral disengagement respond differently to affective measures and scales of moral disengagement, these measures could be used as indirect measures of (dis)honesty, either in court or in earlier interrogations.
The research findings generated by this project will be disseminated in a variety of ways. Primarily, these findings will be communicated to the scientific community through publications in international, peer-reviewed journals. Additionally, the findings will be discussed at international conferences focusing on psycholegal research. The findings will also be disseminated to practitioners via contributions to handbooks and book chapters geared towards the legal community. Moreover, the PIâ€™s advisor regularly gives lectures and seminars to legal professionals, and will communicate the research findings in these settings.
