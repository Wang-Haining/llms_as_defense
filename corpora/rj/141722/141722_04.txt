In spite of all of our differences, we can all agree on one thing. Customer Service from online corporate entities sucks ! For the sake of this installment, we’re talking about customer service in the online environment from the likes of Ebay, PayPal, Amazon, etc….that sort of thing.
Now at first thought, you might say that this has changed and many companies do publish customer service phone numbers now. Yes, that’s certainly true. But have you actually talked to someone that actually helped you, spoke in clear English, had the authority to make decisions you needed? Or, did you just get the human version of a complaint registry.
Maybe we should be grateful. I’m supposing that it’s just an inept ability to process change that keeps corporations feeling as if they need to even pay lip service to customer service. Once they actually realize that we have little to no choice but to do business with them, or do without; they’ll just drop customer service altogether.
