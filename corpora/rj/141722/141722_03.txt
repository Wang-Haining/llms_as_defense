I didn’t finish college when I was younger. I didn’t drop out, I just flunked out. So, I continued to collect financial aid floundering around in school to the point that I reached my lifetime limit. I shouldn’t have been there until I knew why I needed to go and what I wanted to do with it. But, Dad said,”Go to college, you’re going to need it”. I’ll be paying that back for the next 20 years or so. Now that I’ve gotten older and wiser, I’d like to return and do it right. But, without financial aid, it’s not going to happen. Pay for it myself? Since I’m a felon, I can’t get a decent job. So, that’s that. Also, I’m pretty sure that I couldn’t mentally handle the workload since my stroke...so, that’s that again.

	I got married about thirty years ago, it was the best thing I ever did before having children, and we’re still together. How’d my wedding go? Well, my Mother wouldn’t come if my Dad came with his second wife. My Dad wouldn’t come because “he’s dead set against the institution of marriage” even though he’s been married twice and still is married to this day, and because of his decree that I should never get married. My future Mother in law wouldn’t come if her ex husband, my wife’s Father, was going to walk her down the aisle. My Father in Law couldn’t come because he was an alcoholic. My best man couldn’t come because he couldn’t miss one college class to do so. Good God!

I’ve got two Daughters. I pour my efforts into them in the hopes that they can grow up and have much better lives than I have. So far, it’s working. I’m better at being a parent than anything I’ve ever done. They’re having tremendous success thus far. I’m not going to stop that by any means, but damn, I wish I could do something for myself too.

I haven’t completely given up though. I still keep a candle burning somewhere in my soul for the long lost hope that might return someday.
