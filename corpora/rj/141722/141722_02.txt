	Point of all of this ? There’s two. First, my problem isn’t that I don’t understand that I did wrong and all that goes along with that. Frankly, what I don’t understand is why they didn’t have more of a sense of humor about it all. Sheesh, I’ve been ripped off dozens of times in my life, some for as much as $20,000. I didn’t go out and pursue felony charges against anyone. I chalked it up as experience and moved on. Second, why were they so attached to their anger? I had dozens of people who I had already refunded before I was charged. They’d get really upset when they got their money back! It’s like I pulled the rug out from under their anger and was making it difficult for them to throw a fit anymore.
	What I’ve gathered from all of this? Crime isn’t for me. People love their anger more than they love their money. People love their money more than they love anyone or anything else other than their anger. People want their enemies to suffer horrible punishments, far beyond what our justice system measures out. People don’t want to have to lift a finger, or come out of their comfort zone, to bring about those punishments in reality. It’s all very contradictory. There seems to be a disconnect between the hate in their souls and the will in their minds. Come on guys, if you’ve got hate in your heart...let it out….or shut the fuck up and go on with your lives. It’s like the worst of everything. They’ve got this seething hatred that still isn’t enough to overcome their sloth or cowardice. Isn’t that the very definition of a spineless worm?
