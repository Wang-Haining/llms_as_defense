Omniscience in the context of Confessions of a Teenage Hermaphrodite is directly challenging the idea of being an intersex female, it is though Jamie’s father has thoughts that tie into society, especially the time-period the story takes place in. One of the most difficult realities at play is the idea of intersex people not being accepted by their own family, not just society. While the story ends positively, with Jamie’s marriage, family in attendance, and her father’s views clearly being more tolerant and accepting, one could argue this ties directly into society’s own views, as progressive ideologies further cement themselves. The lack of acceptance, especially in family, only further complicates what it means to be intersex. To already be between sexes, but to also be pushed one way or another, when one’s mind is leaning towards another path, is certainly distressing.
Thus, the lesson to take away from the novel is one showing the detrimental effects enforcing one’s own believes can have on someone whom is intersex or struggling with their gender identity. Using Jamie’s father as a figurehead, representative of society, is a clever idea, as it showed many of the detrimental situations it led Jamie into, leading to plenty of heartbreak and stress. Moreover, it is a great message of perceived omniscience and the damage it may cause. While one may believe they have all the answers, despite their power and influence, the original path Jamie’s father had sought certainly was one that was not bringing happiness to either Jamie or her father, ultimately showing the damage preconceived notions of gender can bring in regards to the livelihood of intersex people.
