Thus, for computer scientists, calculus is here to stay and simply must be learned for a large portion of the field’s work options. Even in situations where calculus is not used daily, weekly, or even at all, the logical thinking that comes with learning it can be argued as essential. In this regard, learning calculus can only help any prospective student. What defines calculus as unique compared to other branches of mathematics for computer science then is that it’s especially flexible. The entirety of mathematic is logic-based so one could naturally presume learning algebra or basic arithmetic also enhanced logical learning. Yet, neither have the variance that calculus has with its countless uses for the field due to its many branches and parts. Computer science and calculus complement one another quite well in this regard, being that within computer science there are many branches, the same goes for calculus, one can utilize many specialized branches to achieve a result towards whatever they may be working on. The question for students should then be where do they start, rather than what’s the point. As MacCormick stated earlier, with more math comes more options and every student should strive to maximize their options.
