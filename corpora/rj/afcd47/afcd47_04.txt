Mammy Jane represents the Uncle Toms who care more about the masters wellbeing than the master himself. When an individual has lived for an extended period of time in an institution, they begin to believe that this institution is the only way to exist.

	The Reconstruction period brought with it many things, but quite possible the greatest thing that it brought was hope, hope that the period of chattel slavery in the US was over, hope that the nation born after the horrors of a Civil War would be able to build a better future for all of its citizens, hope that the blood that had been spilt carried within its cells the spirit of true freedom. However, “After the removal of the armed forces under the terms of the compromise of 1877, which had protected newly freed slaves since Emancipation, the white south was anxious to reverse any and all progress made by blacks”. This compromise sealed the fate of the former slaves and removed coercive power and replaced it with goodwill, and this goodwill was nothing more than a mirage. Those who though that they were now free had to face a new challenge based on an ancient evil, and it fell to men like Charles W. Chesnutt to attempt to turn back the tide using nothing more than his pen.
