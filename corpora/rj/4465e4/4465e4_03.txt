	As a student of human behavior this exercise has helped progress my knowledge in a few ways, but one is greater than the others.  Prior to this exercise, the city council meetings and processes were a foreign entity.  While researching I read many council meeting Minutes and have a better understanding of some of the wants of my own community.  I realized that reading these minutes or even attending a meeting or more can help a social worker better understand the needs of his/her community.  The only set back is that many residents do not use this avenue and there are many more greivances than those mentioned at these meetings.  If a social worker attends these meetings, he/she can also lobby for the peoples’ needs who do not attend by addressing situations his/herself directly at the meeting or taking the grievances up the chain and lobbying at higher levels.
