            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

The Church says priests are married to God, but everyone else has a family and job. Priests can love God and their family.

So, I don't think gay people should be blamed for their sexual orientation.\n\nI don't think it's fair to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. That's not right. People should be free to love and marry whoever they want.\n\nThe government should not decide who can get married. Marriage is a personal choice. If two people love each other, they should be allowed to marry. It's not the government's business.\n\nGay people should not be punished for being who they are. They should be treated with respect. Everyone is different, and that's okay.\n\nThe government has more important things to worry about than who gets married. They should focus on keeping us safe and helping people who need it.

            "I think gay marriage should be legal. \n\nThere is no good reason not to. \n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. \n\nGay couples are different, and so are straight couples. They are like two sides of the same coin. \n\nEach side is not better or worse than the other. \n\nIn fact, gay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should have the same rights as well. \n\nFor example, if you are in a gay relationship, your partner may not be able to visit you in the hospital. This is not fair. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success as straight couples. They have the same factors that keep their relationships strong. \n\nThe main issue is that some people do not want gay couples to get married in a church. But this is not the same as a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the church and government are separate, this should not be a problem. \n\nIn some countries, a civil union is allowed but not marriage. This is like being separate but unequal. \n\nGay couples have the same kind of relationship as straight couples. They play the same roles and have the same responsibilities. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and community issues. They think that gay couples will affect their community. \n\nBut the truth is that children of gay couples are the same as children of straight couples. They need love and care, not because of their parents' sexual orientation. \n\nIn some places, like New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. This is because they have been treated poorly in public schools. \n\nBut it's not the parents' fault. It's the fault of the people who treat them poorly. \n\nThe government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, but they are based on his religion. This is not a good reason to make a law. \n\nThe government should not enforce one group's morality on the whole country. This is unfair and hypocritical. \n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or abnormal. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. \n\nWe should listen to facts and research, not just what our neighbors or friends think. \n\nIf we do, we will see that gay couples are just like straight couples. They deserve the same rights.",

            "I think the church has changed a lot in the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I would wear nice dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. We would attend a long church service.\n\nNow, the church has a shorter service, only 30 minutes. People dress more casually, even on Sundays. In the summer, some people wear beach clothes. Families sometimes come in late. The church has become more casual.\n\nThe biggest change I noticed is how people dress. Even in the morning services, people wear jeans and khakis. It's a big change from when I was younger.\n\nI don't know much about the church's politics. But I think the church changed for the better.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I think some bad things could not have been prevented. There are married men who are pedophiles. Even if they were allowed to get married, it wouldn't stop them from being pedophiles. It's not because they are allowed or not allowed to get married.\n\nSome religions allow married priests or ministers. For example, the Seventh-day Adventist Church has married ministers. If someone wants to be a priest and get married, they might choose a different religion.\n\nI think people are born with their sexuality, and it's based on genetics. You can't change it, even through marriage. If someone is a pedophile, it will show. If the church knew about the problem and tried to hide it, they should be ashamed. But I don't think they knew in all cases.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",

Even Colin Powell said he was not sure about the evidence when he was presenting it to the UN. This is wrong. It is a serious mistake to lie to the people.\n\nI think the Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution.

But I do not think it is a good idea to stay either. The US and the UN are trying to get other countries in the area to help Iraq. But this might cause more problems in the long run.\n\nIraq's government is not working well. The Parliament is not effective and the Prime Minister does not have control.

            "I think the war has gone on too long. \nThe original reason was to bring democracy to another country. \nBut now, I think we are fighting for the sake of fighting. \nWe want to show that we are a powerful country. \nThis is not a good reason for a war. \n\nThe conflict began because of George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. \nBut even if our goal was to give democracy to a country with no fair government, that would be a good reason. \nHowever, personal problems are not a good reason for war. \n\nI think we made our point early on. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nThis is too long. \n\nIf our goal was to stop a dictator, that would be a good reason for the war. \nBut now, our reason for fighting seems unclear. \nIt seems like we are fighting because we do not want to stop fighting. \n\nI think the war has gone on long enough. \nThe country we are helping will have to take care of itself soon. \nWe have our own problems, like poverty and poor roads. \nWe should spend our money on these problems, not on a long war. \n\nWe are spending a lot of money on the war. \nThis money could be used for better things, like healthcare and education. \nOur own citizens are being killed in the war, and we are not winning.",
            "I want to ask a question to make things clear.\n\nYou see, someone found information on the internet that stopped something bad from happening.  This person looked at a website like Myspace where people put their personal information. If you put something on the internet, it's like sending a message to many people. They can see it.\n\nOn Myspace, you need to be a friend with someone to see their information. But if you are their friend, you have given them permission to see your information. So, you have to understand that many people can see what you put on the internet.\n\nIf someone saw something on the internet and stopped something bad from happening, that's good. But it's not easy to find that information. You can't have one person looking at everyone's Myspace to stop bad things. That would be unfair to some people.\n\nIt's hard to decide if it's right to have someone's job to look at people's Myspace. It depends on why they were looking. Were they looking for something specific or just randomly?\n\nI have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are people who can see my information. I know a person on TV showed how easy it is to get information from the internet. He got someone's screen name and talked to her on instant messenger. I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I have had people in my class who know my screen name and contact me.\n\nIt's hard to control what you put on the internet. You want to be able to communicate with friends, but you also don't want strangers to see your information. I try to limit what I put on Facebook, but it's hard.\n\nMy roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure if that's right. Can the school tell students what they can and can't do on the internet?",
            "The Iraq War is a big problem. I want to talk about it. I feel strange saying I was against it from the beginning. Most people in the world think it was a bad idea. \n\nPolls show the same thing. Most people in the United States, Iraq, and all over the world think it was a bad idea. Even most of the U.S. troops in Iraq think it was a bad idea. They want to leave within a year.\n\nThe Iraq War has been a disaster since the beginning. It was already a problem before the U.S. got involved. Now, leaving will also be difficult. There is a big cultural difference between the United States and the Middle East. It is hard for the U.S. government to understand and fix this problem.\n\nThe U.S. government wanted to bring democracy to Iraq, but this is not what the Iraqis wanted. Saddam Hussein was a bad man, but the U.S. should have thought about the pros and cons before invading Iraq.\n\nI do not think it is good for the U.S. to stay in Iraq. The administration may have some ideas for why we should stay, but I do not agree. If we leave slowly, that is okay. But, I do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq.\n\nMost Iraqis think the U.S. should leave within a year. If we ask them, they will say what they want. If something goes wrong, we can say it is not our fault. We will be the good guys if we leave now. At least we will be better than we are now.",
            "There is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This problem exists in many areas of work.\n\nNot just for women, but also for men. The kind of work a person does affects how they are treated. In some areas, women have a harder time getting ahead. This is because of a idea that men are usually in charge. But this is not always true.\n\nEven if a woman has the qualifications and skills for a job, she may not be chosen for it. This is because of how people think women should be treated. But it's not just women who face this problem.\n\nMen also face issues. For example, in the fashion industry, men who are interested in fashion are often not taken seriously. This is because people think men who like fashion are not 'normal'. But this is changing.\n\nSome men are now staying home to take care of their children, which is not common. People often look down on them because they think men should be the ones working to make money. But this is not always true.\n\nChange is slow. But we are making progress. More women are becoming leaders and getting accepted in business. This is a good thing.\n\nWe need to show the good qualities of people who are often treated unfairly. We should not force people to accept change, but let them see the good things about these individuals. This way, people will be more likely to accept them.\n\nWe have made a lot of progress, but change takes time. We should be patient and continue to work towards making things fairer. We are at a good point now, where people are starting to accept change.\n\nOther problems exist, like people being treated unfairly because of where they are from or how they speak. This is another example of how people are treated unfairly because of how they are different.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana was not made legal.  It was decriminalized.  This means it is no longer a serious crime.  Instead, it is like getting a traffic ticket.  You get in trouble, but not arrested.\n\nIf you get a marijuana ticket, it can affect your life.  It can affect your job or how you look in front of a judge.  Usually, having a drug charge is bad.  But when something is decriminalized, these bad effects are not as bad.\n\nSome people think decriminalizing marijuana is not a good idea.  They think it costs too much money to arrest and put people in jail.  It also costs money to go to court.  But some places are willing to make this change.  They think it will save money.\n\nIn Denver, people are more open-minded.  They think it is okay to decriminalize marijuana.  This city has more money now to help people.  They can spend it on education, food for the homeless, and other important things.\n\nI think it's good to decriminalize marijuana.  It's not good to have it just anywhere.  There are many reasons for this.  One reason is money.  Another reason is that some people might smoke and drive.  This is not good.  Many people think smoking marijuana is taboo.  We should not have it in public.\n\nAlcohol can be bad for people.  It can affect their driving.  But marijuana can affect how people live their lives.  Some people can use it and be fine.  Others cannot.  It depends on the person.\n\nWe cannot say that one substance is always bad.  Everyone reacts differently.  Some people can control themselves.  Others cannot.  We should be careful when we talk about substances.",
            "I agree. \nThere are good reasons for the Catholic Church's old customs. \nThey do many things the same way for a long time. \nThis is good because it shows respect for tradition. \nHowever, it is also important to be flexible and change when necessary.\n\nThe Catholic Church says its followers must go to church every week. \nThey have rules for everything. \nSometimes, it seems like the Church does not accept people who do not follow the rules perfectly. \nIt also does not accept people of other religions. \nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry us because my dad was not Catholic.\n\nThis is not showing love and acceptance of others. \nThe Catholic Church says to love others, but it does not act that way. \nMany Catholic rules tell people to do one thing, but the Church does not follow those rules.\n\nI do not think allowing priests to be married would stop them from doing bad things. \nPeople who hurt children will do it anyway. \nThey are hurting children, not grown-ups. \nSo, marriage or not, they will still hurt children. \nI do not think allowing priests to be married would make a difference.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I do not know if one side is right and the other is wrong. This is a very difficult topic. It is hard to decide without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a big problem. Defining marriage is also hard. Some people think marriage is between a man and a woman. Others think it is between two people who love each other.\n\nIf marriage is a sacrament, the government should not make rules about it. But if marriage is not a sacrament, the government should give tax breaks to married couples.\n\nI think marriage should be considered a civil union. It is two people who love each other. The government should not worry about what kind of marriage it is.\n\nIf all the states agree on this issue, the government should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not important enough to change the constitution.\n\nIn simple words, we should not change the constitution to ban gay marriage. Two people who love each other should have the same rights as anyone else.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. But I have friends who are gay. This makes the issue of homosexuality unclear for me. I do not agree with every aspect of the gay lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. It is not a matter for the whole country. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, and some are Republican. Democratic states usually support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows gay marriage, it is your choice. If the state decides to make gay marriage legal, you should accept the decision. This is because you chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. So, each state should decide whether to make gay marriage legal.\n\nI already said this. But I want to say it again. The president should not decide for the whole country. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nGeorge Bush is against gay marriage. But he cannot decide for all the states. He does not live in every state. It is not his decision to make.\n\nSome things should be decided by each state. The president will not be in office forever. If a new president wants to change the law, it will just go back and forth. Each state should make its own decision. They will have to live with the result.",
            "Myspace is a public website. If you post something on it, everyone can see it. School officials have the right to see it because they can access it from their homes. \n\nImagine someone is posting something on Myspace that could cause a school shooting. School officials should be able to see that to prevent it. They have a responsibility to make sure the school is safe.\n\nSchool officials might go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing. They do this to keep the school safe. Some people think this is an invasion of privacy. But I don't think so. If it helps keep the school safe, it's okay.\n\nIt's easier to express yourself when you write. But on Myspace, everything you post is public. It's not a good idea to say things you don't want others to see. Once you post something on the internet, it's there forever.\n\nSchool officials should not just go on the internet to catch students. But if they have a good reason, like to make the school safer, it's okay. When parents drop off their children at school, they expect it to be a safe place. School officials have a responsibility to make that happen.\n\nThe school had to prepare for emergencies, like school shootings, by doing drills. This is to keep the school safe. School officials were doing the same thing in this case. They were trying to prevent bad things from happening.\n\nThe purpose of the school officials going on the internet was to make the school a safer place. They wanted to prevent something like the Columbine school shooting from happening.",
            "I was for the war at first. It was because I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to fight back. But then I thought about it more. I realized we were not ready for war. We did not have a plan. We just went in without thinking about the long-term effects.\n\nI think we made a mistake. Going to war was not the right decision. The people in that country are fighting each other. They cannot fight us if they are busy fighting themselves. Our being there is not helping. \n\nI do not care about what happens in that country anymore. They are not like us. They fight in a different way. It is not like our war. They are not trying to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were not thinking clearly. We were angry and wanted revenge. President Bush declared war on Iraq. I understand why he did it. The people wanted to fight back. But we did not plan well. We did not know what to do when we got there.\n\nWe should have made a better plan. We should have thought about what would happen after the war. We did not have unity. We did not know what we were doing. That would have helped us.\n\nI do not think we can change those people. They are always going to be like that. \n\nWe are not making progress. We made some progress, but not enough. I think we should leave. Once we leave, their country will fall apart. We cannot stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should just leave."

studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think gay marriage is a good idea. I don't think people are born straight or gay by choice. They are born that way. So, I don't think gay people should be blamed for their sexual orientation.\n\nI don't think it's fair to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. That's not right. People should be free to love and marry whoever they want.\n\nThe government should not decide who can get married. Marriage is a personal choice. If two people love each other, they should be allowed to marry. It's not the government's business.\n\nGay people should not be punished for being who they are. They should be treated with respect. Everyone is different, and that's okay.\n\nThe government has more important things to worry about than who gets married. They should focus on keeping us safe and helping people who need it. Marriage is a personal choice, and the government should not get involved.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. \n\nThere is no good reason not to. \n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. \n\nGay couples are different, and so are straight couples. They are like two sides of the same coin. \n\nEach side is not better or worse than the other. \n\nIn fact, gay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should have the same rights as well. \n\nFor example, if you are in a gay relationship, your partner may not be able to visit you in the hospital. This is not fair. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success as straight couples. They have the same factors that keep their relationships strong. \n\nThe main issue is that some people do not want gay couples to get married in a church. But this is not the same as a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the church and government are separate, this should not be a problem. \n\nIn some countries, a civil union is allowed but not marriage. This is like being separate but unequal. \n\nGay couples have the same kind of relationship as straight couples. They play the same roles and have the same responsibilities. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and community issues. They think that gay couples will affect their community. \n\nBut the truth is that children of gay couples are the same as children of straight couples. They need love and care, not because of their parents' sexual orientation. \n\nIn some places, like New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. This is because they have been treated poorly in public schools. \n\nBut it's not the parents' fault. It's the fault of the people who treat them poorly. \n\nThe government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, but they are based on his religion. This is not a good reason to make a law. \n\nThe government should not enforce one group's morality on the whole country. This is unfair and hypocritical. \n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or abnormal. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. \n\nWe should listen to facts and research, not just what our neighbors or friends think. \n\nIf we do, we will see that gay couples are just like straight couples. They deserve the same rights.",

They are controlled because they can be bad if not used correctly. \n\nBut because they have good qualities, we use them in the pharmacy. If we think marijuana has good qualities, we should use it too. \n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If you use too much of either one, bad things can happen. \n\nHowever, we could make marijuana legal, but not all at once. We should make people understand that it is not bad first. Then maybe people will use it correctly. \n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine.

            "I think the church has changed a lot in the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I would wear nice dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. We would attend a long church service.\n\nNow, the church has a shorter service, only 30 minutes. People dress more casually, even on Sundays. In the summer, some people wear beach clothes. Families sometimes come in late. The church has become more casual.\n\nThe biggest change I noticed is how people dress. Even in the morning services, people wear jeans and khakis. It's a big change from when I was younger.\n\nI don't know much about the church's politics. But I think the church changed for the better.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I think some bad things could not have been prevented. There are married men who are pedophiles. Even if they were allowed to get married, it wouldn't stop them from being pedophiles. It's not because they are allowed or not allowed to get married.\n\nSome religions allow married priests or ministers. For example, the Seventh-day Adventist Church has married ministers. If someone wants to be a priest and get married, they might choose a different religion.\n\nI think people are born with their sexuality, and it's based on genetics. You can't change it, even through marriage. If someone is a pedophile, it will show. If the church knew about the problem and tried to hide it, they should be ashamed. But I don't think they knew in all cases.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea at first. But then the September 11th attacks happened. The United States went to war in Iraq. I think we used false reasons to go to war.

Even Colin Powell said he was not sure about the evidence when he was presenting it to the UN. This is wrong. It is a serious mistake to lie to the people.\n\nI think the Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution. They have been trying to make it less important since the September 11th attacks. They wanted to go to war from the start.\n\nA former government official said that George Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of a personal reason. He wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein. This is not a good reason for war.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If we leave now, the country might fall into a civil war and many more people will die. But I do not think it is a good idea to stay either. The US and the UN are trying to get other countries in the area to help Iraq. But this might cause more problems in the long run.\n\nIraq's government is not working well. The Parliament is not effective and the Prime Minister does not have control. A strong leader, Muqtada al-Sadr, has 20 seats in the Parliament and is causing problems.

Even most of the U.S. troops in Iraq think it was a bad idea. They want to leave within a year.\n\nThe Iraq War has been a disaster since the beginning. It was already a problem before the U.S. got involved. Now, leaving will also be difficult. There is a big cultural difference between the United States and the Middle East. It is hard for the U.S. government to understand and fix this problem.\n\nThe U.S. government wanted to bring democracy to Iraq, but this is not what the Iraqis wanted. Saddam Hussein was a bad man, but the U.S. should have thought about the pros and cons before invading Iraq.\n\nI do not think it is good for the U.S. to stay in Iraq. The administration may have some ideas for why we should stay, but I do not agree. If we leave slowly, that is okay. But, I do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq.\n\nMost Iraqis think the U.S. should leave within a year. If we ask them, they will say what they want. If something goes wrong, we can say it is not our fault. We will be the good guys if we leave now. At least we will be better than we are now.",
            "There is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This problem exists in many areas of work.\n\nNot just for women, but also for men. The kind of work a person does affects how they are treated. In some areas, women have a harder time getting ahead. This is because of a idea that men are usually in charge. But this is not always true.\n\nEven if a woman has the qualifications and skills for a job, she may not be chosen for it. This is because of how people think women should be treated. But it's not just women who face this problem.\n\nMen also face issues. For example, in the fashion industry, men who are interested in fashion are often not taken seriously. This is because people think men who like fashion are not 'normal'. But this is changing.\n\nSome men are now staying home to take care of their children, which is not common. People often look down on them because they think men should be the ones working to make money. But this is not always true.\n\nChange is slow. But we are making progress. More women are becoming leaders and getting accepted in business. This is a good thing.\n\nWe need to show the good qualities of people who are often treated unfairly. We should not force people to accept change, but let them see the good things about these individuals. This way, people will be more likely to accept them.\n\nWe have made a lot of progress, but change takes time. We should be patient and continue to work towards making things fairer. We are at a good point now, where people are starting to accept change.\n\nOther problems exist, like people being treated unfairly because of where they are from or how they speak. This is another example of how people are treated unfairly because of how they are different.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana was not made legal.  It was decriminalized.  This means it is no longer a serious crime.  Instead, it is like getting a traffic ticket.  You get in trouble, but not arrested.\n\nIf you get a marijuana ticket, it can affect your life.  It can affect your job or how you look in front of a judge.  Usually, having a drug charge is bad.  But when something is decriminalized, these bad effects are not as bad.\n\nSome people think decriminalizing marijuana is not a good idea.  They think it costs too much money to arrest and put people in jail.  It also costs money to go to court.  But some places are willing to make this change.  They think it will save money.\n\nIn Denver, people are more open-minded.  They think it is okay to decriminalize marijuana.  This city has more money now to help people.  They can spend it on education, food for the homeless, and other important things.\n\nI think it's good to decriminalize marijuana.  It's not good to have it just anywhere.  There are many reasons for this.  One reason is money.  Another reason is that some people might smoke and drive.  This is not good.  Many people think smoking marijuana is taboo.  We should not have it in public.\n\nAlcohol can be bad for people.  It can affect their driving.  But marijuana can affect how people live their lives.  Some people can use it and be fine.  Others cannot.  It depends on the person.\n\nWe cannot say that one substance is always bad.  Everyone reacts differently.  Some people can control themselves.  Others cannot.  We should be careful when we talk about substances.",
            "I agree. \nThere are good reasons for the Catholic Church's old customs. \nThey do many things the same way for a long time. \nThis is good because it shows respect for tradition. \nHowever, it is also important to be flexible and change when necessary.\n\nThe Catholic Church says its followers must go to church every week. \nThey have rules for everything. \nSometimes, it seems like the Church does not accept people who do not follow the rules perfectly. \nIt also does not accept people of other religions. \nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry us because my dad was not Catholic.\n\nThis is not showing love and acceptance of others. \nThe Catholic Church says to love others, but it does not act that way. \nMany Catholic rules tell people to do one thing, but the Church does not follow those rules.\n\nI do not think allowing priests to be married would stop them from doing bad things. \nPeople who hurt children will do it anyway. \nThey are hurting children, not grown-ups. \nSo, marriage or not, they will still hurt children. \nI do not think allowing priests to be married would make a difference.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I do not know if one side is right and the other is wrong. This is a very difficult topic. It is hard to decide without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a big problem. Defining marriage is also hard. Some people think marriage is between a man and a woman. Others think it is between two people who love each other.\n\nIf marriage is a sacrament, the government should not make rules about it. But if marriage is not a sacrament, the government should give tax breaks to married couples.\n\nI think marriage should be considered a civil union. It is two people who love each other. The government should not worry about what kind of marriage it is.\n\nIf all the states agree on this issue, the government should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not important enough to change the constitution.\n\nIn simple words, we should not change the constitution to ban gay marriage. Two people who love each other should have the same rights as anyone else.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. But I have friends who are gay. This makes the issue of homosexuality unclear for me. I do not agree with every aspect of the gay lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. It is not a matter for the whole country. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, and some are Republican. Democratic states usually support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows gay marriage, it is your choice. If the state decides to make gay marriage legal, you should accept the decision. This is because you chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. So, each state should decide whether to make gay marriage legal.\n\nI already said this. But I want to say it again. The president should not decide for the whole country. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nGeorge Bush is against gay marriage. But he cannot decide for all the states. He does not live in every state. It is not his decision to make.\n\nSome things should be decided by each state. The president will not be in office forever. If a new president wants to change the law, it will just go back and forth. Each state should make its own decision. They will have to live with the result.",
            "Myspace is a public website. If you post something on it, everyone can see it. School officials have the right to see it because they can access it from their homes. \n\nImagine someone is posting something on Myspace that could cause a school shooting. School officials should be able to see that to prevent it. They have a responsibility to make sure the school is safe.\n\nSchool officials might go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing. They do this to keep the school safe. Some people think this is an invasion of privacy. But I don't think so. If it helps keep the school safe, it's okay.\n\nIt's easier to express yourself when you write. But on Myspace, everything you post is public. It's not a good idea to say things you don't want others to see. Once you post something on the internet, it's there forever.\n\nSchool officials should not just go on the internet to catch students. But if they have a good reason, like to make the school safer, it's okay. When parents drop off their children at school, they expect it to be a safe place. School officials have a responsibility to make that happen.\n\nThe school had to prepare for emergencies, like school shootings, by doing drills. This is to keep the school safe. School officials were doing the same thing in this case. They were trying to prevent bad things from happening.\n\nThe purpose of the school officials going on the internet was to make the school a safer place. They wanted to prevent something like the Columbine school shooting from happening.",
            "I was for the war at first. It was because I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to fight back. But then I thought about it more. I realized we were not ready for war. We did not have a plan. We just went in without thinking about the long-term effects.\n\nI think we made a mistake. Going to war was not the right decision. The people in that country are fighting each other. They cannot fight us if they are busy fighting themselves. Our being there is not helping. \n\nI do not care about what happens in that country anymore. They are not like us. They fight in a different way. It is not like our war. They are not trying to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were not thinking clearly. We were angry and wanted revenge. President Bush declared war on Iraq. I understand why he did it. The people wanted to fight back. But we did not plan well. We did not know what to do when we got there.\n\nWe should have made a better plan. We should have thought about what would happen after the war. We did not have unity. We did not know what we were doing. That would have helped us.\n\nI do not think we can change those people. They are always going to be like that. \n\nWe are not making progress. We made some progress, but not enough. I think we should leave. Once we leave, their country will fall apart. We cannot stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should just leave."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think gay marriage is a good idea. I don't think people are born straight or gay by choice. They are born that way. So, I don't think gay people should be blamed for their sexual orientation.\n\nI don't think it's fair to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. That's not right. People should be free to love and marry whoever they want.\n\nThe government should not decide who can get married. Marriage is a personal choice. If two people love each other, they should be allowed to marry. It's not the government's business.\n\nGay people should not be punished for being who they are. They should be treated with respect. Everyone is different, and that's okay.\n\nThe government has more important things to worry about than who gets married. They should focus on keeping us safe and helping people who need it. Marriage is a personal choice, and the government should not get involved.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. \n\nThere is no good reason not to. \n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. \n\nGay couples are different, and so are straight couples. They are like two sides of the same coin. \n\nEach side is not better or worse than the other. \n\nIn fact, gay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should have the same rights as well. \n\nFor example, if you are in a gay relationship, your partner may not be able to visit you in the hospital. This is not fair. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success as straight couples. They have the same factors that keep their relationships strong. \n\nThe main issue is that some people do not want gay couples to get married in a church. But this is not the same as a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the church and government are separate, this should not be a problem. \n\nIn some countries, a civil union is allowed but not marriage. This is like being separate but unequal. \n\nGay couples have the same kind of relationship as straight couples. They play the same roles and have the same responsibilities. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and community issues. They think that gay couples will affect their community. \n\nBut the truth is that children of gay couples are the same as children of straight couples. They need love and care, not because of their parents' sexual orientation. \n\nIn some places, like New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. This is because they have been treated poorly in public schools. \n\nBut it's not the parents' fault. It's the fault of the people who treat them poorly. \n\nThe government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, but they are based on his religion. This is not a good reason to make a law. \n\nThe government should not enforce one group's morality on the whole country. This is unfair and hypocritical. \n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or abnormal. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. \n\nWe should listen to facts and research, not just what our neighbors or friends think. \n\nIf we do, we will see that gay couples are just like straight couples. They deserve the same rights.",

They are controlled because they can be bad if not used correctly. \n\nBut because they have good qualities, we use them in the pharmacy. If we think marijuana has good qualities, we should use it too. \n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If you use too much of either one, bad things can happen. \n\nHowever, we could make marijuana legal, but not all at once. We should make people understand that it is not bad first. Then maybe people will use it correctly. \n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine.

            "I think the church has changed a lot in the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I would wear nice dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. We would attend a long church service.\n\nNow, the church has a shorter service, only 30 minutes. People dress more casually, even on Sundays. In the summer, some people wear beach clothes. Families sometimes come in late. The church has become more casual.\n\nThe biggest change I noticed is how people dress. Even in the morning services, people wear jeans and khakis. It's a big change from when I was younger.\n\nI don't know much about the church's politics. But I think the church changed for the better.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I think some bad things could not have been prevented. There are married men who are pedophiles. Even if they were allowed to get married, it wouldn't stop them from being pedophiles. It's not because they are allowed or not allowed to get married.\n\nSome religions allow married priests or ministers. For example, the Seventh-day Adventist Church has married ministers. If someone wants to be a priest and get married, they might choose a different religion.\n\nI think people are born with their sexuality, and it's based on genetics. You can't change it, even through marriage. If someone is a pedophile, it will show. If the church knew about the problem and tried to hide it, they should be ashamed. But I don't think they knew in all cases.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea at first. But then the September 11th attacks happened. The United States went to war in Iraq. I think we used false reasons to go to war.

Even Colin Powell said he was not sure about the evidence when he was presenting it to the UN. This is wrong. It is a serious mistake to lie to the people.\n\nI think the Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution. They have been trying to make it less important since the September 11th attacks. They wanted to go to war from the start.\n\nA former government official said that George Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of a personal reason. He wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein. This is not a good reason for war.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If we leave now, the country might fall into a civil war and many more people will die. But I do not think it is a good idea to stay either. The US and the UN are trying to get other countries in the area to help Iraq. But this might cause more problems in the long run.\n\nIraq's government is not working well. The Parliament is not effective and the Prime Minister does not have control. A strong leader, Muqtada al-Sadr, has 20 seats in the Parliament and is causing problems.

Even most of the U.S. troops in Iraq think it was a bad idea. They want to leave within a year.\n\nThe Iraq War has been a disaster since the beginning. It was already a problem before the U.S. got involved. Now, leaving will also be difficult. There is a big cultural difference between the United States and the Middle East. It is hard for the U.S. government to understand and fix this problem.\n\nThe U.S. government wanted to bring democracy to Iraq, but this is not what the Iraqis wanted. Saddam Hussein was a bad man, but the U.S. should have thought about the pros and cons before invading Iraq.\n\nI do not think it is good for the U.S. to stay in Iraq. The administration may have some ideas for why we should stay, but I do not agree. If we leave slowly, that is okay. But, I do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq.\n\nMost Iraqis think the U.S. should leave within a year. If we ask them, they will say what they want. If something goes wrong, we can say it is not our fault. We will be the good guys if we leave now. At least we will be better than we are now.",
            "There is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This problem exists in many areas of work.\n\nNot just for women, but also for men. The kind of work a person does affects how they are treated. In some areas, women have a harder time getting ahead. This is because of a idea that men are usually in charge. But this is not always true.\n\nEven if a woman has the qualifications and skills for a job, she may not be chosen for it. This is because of how people think women should be treated. But it's not just women who face this problem.\n\nMen also face issues. For example, in the fashion industry, men who are interested in fashion are often not taken seriously. This is because people think men who like fashion are not 'normal'. But this is changing.\n\nSome men are now staying home to take care of their children, which is not common. People often look down on them because they think men should be the ones working to make money. But this is not always true.\n\nChange is slow. But we are making progress. More women are becoming leaders and getting accepted in business. This is a good thing.\n\nWe need to show the good qualities of people who are often treated unfairly. We should not force people to accept change, but let them see the good things about these individuals. This way, people will be more likely to accept them.\n\nWe have made a lot of progress, but change takes time. We should be patient and continue to work towards making things fairer. We are at a good point now, where people are starting to accept change.\n\nOther problems exist, like people being treated unfairly because of where they are from or how they speak. This is another example of how people are treated unfairly because of how they are different.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana was not made legal.  It was decriminalized.  This means it is no longer a serious crime.  Instead, it is like getting a traffic ticket.  You get in trouble, but not arrested.\n\nIf you get a marijuana ticket, it can affect your life.  It can affect your job or how you look in front of a judge.  Usually, having a drug charge is bad.  But when something is decriminalized, these bad effects are not as bad.\n\nSome people think decriminalizing marijuana is not a good idea.  They think it costs too much money to arrest and put people in jail.  It also costs money to go to court.  But some places are willing to make this change.  They think it will save money.\n\nIn Denver, people are more open-minded.  They think it is okay to decriminalize marijuana.  This city has more money now to help people.  They can spend it on education, food for the homeless, and other important things.\n\nI think it's good to decriminalize marijuana.  It's not good to have it just anywhere.  There are many reasons for this.  One reason is money.  Another reason is that some people might smoke and drive.  This is not good.  Many people think smoking marijuana is taboo.  We should not have it in public.\n\nAlcohol can be bad for people.  It can affect their driving.  But marijuana can affect how people live their lives.  Some people can use it and be fine.  Others cannot.  It depends on the person.\n\nWe cannot say that one substance is always bad.  Everyone reacts differently.  Some people can control themselves.  Others cannot.  We should be careful when we talk about substances.",
            "I agree. \nThere are good reasons for the Catholic Church's old customs. \nThey do many things the same way for a long time. \nThis is good because it shows respect for tradition. \nHowever, it is also important to be flexible and change when necessary.\n\nThe Catholic Church says its followers must go to church every week. \nThey have rules for everything. \nSometimes, it seems like the Church does not accept people who do not follow the rules perfectly. \nIt also does not accept people of other religions. \nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry us because my dad was not Catholic.\n\nThis is not showing love and acceptance of others. \nThe Catholic Church says to love others, but it does not act that way. \nMany Catholic rules tell people to do one thing, but the Church does not follow those rules.\n\nI do not think allowing priests to be married would stop them from doing bad things. \nPeople who hurt children will do it anyway. \nThey are hurting children, not grown-ups. \nSo, marriage or not, they will still hurt children. \nI do not think allowing priests to be married would make a difference.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I do not know if one side is right and the other is wrong. This is a very difficult topic. It is hard to decide without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a big problem. Defining marriage is also hard. Some people think marriage is between a man and a woman. Others think it is between two people who love each other.\n\nIf marriage is a sacrament, the government should not make rules about it. But if marriage is not a sacrament, the government should give tax breaks to married couples.\n\nI think marriage should be considered a civil union. It is two people who love each other. The government should not worry about what kind of marriage it is.\n\nIf all the states agree on this issue, the government should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not important enough to change the constitution.\n\nIn simple words, we should not change the constitution to ban gay marriage. Two people who love each other should have the same rights as anyone else.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. But I have friends who are gay. This makes the issue of homosexuality unclear for me. I do not agree with every aspect of the gay lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. It is not a matter for the whole country. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, and some are Republican. Democratic states usually support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows gay marriage, it is your choice. If the state decides to make gay marriage legal, you should accept the decision. This is because you chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. So, each state should decide whether to make gay marriage legal.\n\nI already said this. But I want to say it again. The president should not decide for the whole country. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nGeorge Bush is against gay marriage. But he cannot decide for all the states. He does not live in every state. It is not his decision to make.\n\nSome things should be decided by each state. The president will not be in office forever. If a new president wants to change the law, it will just go back and forth. Each state should make its own decision. They will have to live with the result.",
            "Myspace is a public website. If you post something on it, everyone can see it. School officials have the right to see it because they can access it from their homes. \n\nImagine someone is posting something on Myspace that could cause a school shooting. School officials should be able to see that to prevent it. They have a responsibility to make sure the school is safe.\n\nSchool officials might go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing. They do this to keep the school safe. Some people think this is an invasion of privacy. But I don't think so. If it helps keep the school safe, it's okay.\n\nIt's easier to express yourself when you write. But on Myspace, everything you post is public. It's not a good idea to say things you don't want others to see. Once you post something on the internet, it's there forever.\n\nSchool officials should not just go on the internet to catch students. But if they have a good reason, like to make the school safer, it's okay. When parents drop off their children at school, they expect it to be a safe place. School officials have a responsibility to make that happen.\n\nThe school had to prepare for emergencies, like school shootings, by doing drills. This is to keep the school safe. School officials were doing the same thing in this case. They were trying to prevent bad things from happening.\n\nThe purpose of the school officials going on the internet was to make the school a safer place. They wanted to prevent something like the Columbine school shooting from happening.",
            "I was for the war at first. It was because I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to fight back. But then I thought about it more. I realized we were not ready for war. We did not have a plan. We just went in without thinking about the long-term effects.\n\nI think we made a mistake. Going to war was not the right decision. The people in that country are fighting each other. They cannot fight us if they are busy fighting themselves. Our being there is not helping. \n\nI do not care about what happens in that country anymore. They are not like us. They fight in a different way. It is not like our war. They are not trying to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were not thinking clearly. We were angry and wanted revenge. President Bush declared war on Iraq. I understand why he did it. The people wanted to fight back. But we did not plan well. We did not know what to do when we got there.\n\nWe should have made a better plan. We should have thought about what would happen after the war. We did not have unity. We did not know what we were doing. That would have helped us.\n\nI do not think we can change those people. They are always going to be like that. \n\nWe are not making progress. We made some progress, but not enough. I think we should leave. Once we leave, their country will fall apart. We cannot stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should just leave."
