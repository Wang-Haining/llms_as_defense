            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

But the Church is not changing. Many people disagree with the Church on these issues.

But everyone has a family and other people they love. Priests should be able to have families and love their families too.\n\nThe Church should change its rules.

They should have the right to own property and get medical care together.\n\nIf a gay person is sick, their partner can't visit them in the hospital. This is not fair. They should be able to be together.\n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are happy and successful. They have the same factors that make a relationship good.\n\nGay people are not asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government.\n\nThe government should not make laws based on one person's or group's religion. This is called separation of church and state.\n\nIf a couple has a civil union, why can't they get married? It's the same in many ways.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and children.

            "I think the church has changed over time to fit the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I grew up going to church every Sunday. I would wear nice clothes and shoes that matched. My church was in a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. They had a teenage mass that was shorter, only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually now, even for morning masses. They wear jeans and khakis. This is a big change. \n\nI don't think changing the rules, like allowing female priests or married priests, would have stopped the problems with some priests and children. Some men are married and still have these problems. It's not because they can or can't get married. It's because of who they are. \n\nThere are other religions where priests can be married. For example, some ministers in the Seventh Day Adventist church can get married. If they want to be married and practice their faith, they might choose a different church. \n\nI think the reason some priests did bad things is because of their own feelings, not because of their job. People are born with certain feelings, like being attracted to children. It's not because of how they were raised. The church couldn't have prevented these problems.\n\nIf some priests knew about the problems and kept it secret, that's wrong. But I don't think that's the case for all priests. \n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",

They connected Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks. This makes me very angry.\n\nThe Bush administration told many lies to the American people. They have not admitted to these lies. Colin Powell, a high official, said he was not sure about the evidence when he talked to the UN.\n\nI think this is very bad. It is against the law for government officials to lie.

We should not use guns to show that we are powerful. \n\nWe did not declare war on Iraq officially. A declared war needs the approval of Congress. \n\nI think we should try to help Iraq, but it is wasting our resources. It is also making President Bush look bad. \n\nThe Vietnam War was also an undeclared war. It is now called a meaningless war. \n\nI do not know what to say. It is hard to make a decision. \n\nThere are many families with sons and daughters in Iraq.

This shows he has a preference for one religion over others. Churches should decide this, not the president or the government.\n\nThere is no good reason to make this law, except for personal opinions.

The war in Iraq was like the war in Vietnam.  The US should have learned from their mistakes in Vietnam.  In Vietnam, the US tried to put in a new government and it did not work.  Many American soldiers died in the war.\n\nThe US government took out the Iraqi government and wanted to put in a new one.  But they were not prepared for what would happen after that.  There was a lot of violence and chaos.  The US is still trying to help the Iraqis build a new government.\n\nI think the US government made a big mistake by going to war.  They did not plan for all the things that could happen.  The war has been going on for a long time and many American soldiers are still dying.  The US is trying to help the Iraqis learn to police their own country, but it is a slow process.\n\nI do not think the US government was honest with the American people about why they went to war.  They said it would be a short and easy war, but it has not been.  It takes a long time to build a new government and make it successful.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in a situation like this.  If the US went to war, they should finish what they started.  But we also have to think about the American soldiers who are dying.  Why are we helping Iraq and not other countries?  I think it is because of the oil in Iraq.\n\nThe US government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were not found.  We know North Korea has these weapons and we are not fighting them.  I do not think the US government is being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq.

If you are friends with someone on Myspace, you will see what they post. But it's not the school that sees it. Someone else sees it and tells the school.\n\nThe school must act on it.

Someone overheard a student talking about something, and they called the school. They looked at the student's Facebook and found some things that might be jokes, but became serious in that situation.\n\nWhen you put something on the internet, there's no privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it. If you don't want someone to see it, don't post it.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on Myspace and Facebook. If someone brings something to their attention, it's a different story. If there is a danger, they must take it seriously.\n\nBut officials should not monitor students' phone conversations or texts. If it's brought to their attention, then it's a different situation.\n\nA teacher should not make a fake Facebook or Myspace account and friend their students. That's the same as monitoring them. I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to see what they do, especially if they post pictures of themselves drinking. That's not my place.",
            "I think the war has lasted too long. \n\nThe main reason was good at first - to give democracy to another country. \n\nBut now, I think we are fighting for different reasons. Maybe we want to prove we are a strong country. \n\nOur motives may have been questionable from the start. We were involved in a disagreement with Saddam Hussein's country long ago. \n\nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country with no fair government, that would be a good reason. But with personal problems involved, it wouldn't be fair. \n\nI think we made our point in the first few months. Starting the war was a statement in itself. \n\nBut the war has lasted for many years. I think it has gone on too long.\n\nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a good reason for war. But our reasons have changed. Now it seems we are fighting just to fight. \n\nWe don't want to end the war without winning. \n\nI think the war has lasted long enough. The country's government will have to take care of itself soon. \n\nWe are spending a lot of money on the war. This money could be used for our own problems, like poverty and bad roads. \n\nWe have many problems at home that need money. We should spend it on things like healthcare and schools. \n\nRight now, our money is being used to lose the war and hurt our own citizens. \n\nThat is all I think.",
            "I have a question about something. \n\nYou see, someone found out about this because they looked online. They went to a website and found some information. I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. If you put something on the internet, everyone can see it. \n\nOn a website called Myspace, you need to have a friend to see someone's profile. But when you accept someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see what you have on your profile. So, if you put something on the internet, many people may see it. \n\nI think it's good that someone found out about this. It may have saved a life. However, this is a problem. We can't have one person looking at everyone's online profiles all the time. That's not fair. \n\nWe can't have someone's job be to look at everyone's profiles. That would be wrong. But, it depends on the situation. If someone is looking for information to help someone, that's different. \n\nI have a Facebook account, but I don't have a Myspace account. I worry about people seeing things about me online. There are people who can get information easily. I saw a TV show about this. A man got a girl's screen name and was talking to her on instant messenger in a few minutes. \n\nIt's hard to protect your information online. People can see many things about you, like your pictures and your favorite classes. I try not to put too much on my Facebook. But it's hard because I want to be able to talk to my friends. \n\nI only accept people I know on Facebook. But you never know who can see what. My roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure if that was right. I don't know how the school had the right to tell students what to do.",
            "The Iraq War is a big issue. I want to talk about it again. \n\nSome people say I'm a hypocrite for talking about it. I was against the war at first. But now I think it's not very important. Most people in the world think the war was a bad idea. \n\nSurveys in the United States, Iraq, and many other countries show this. About 75 to 80 percent of people think the war was a bad idea. Even 80 percent of Iraqi people and 70 percent of US soldiers in Iraq think so. \n\nI think the war was a disaster from the start. It's hard to make good decisions when there's a big difference in culture between the US and the Middle East. \n\nWe tried to bring democracy to Iraq, but it's not what the people there wanted. Saddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the problems before going to war. \n\nNow, it's hard to find a good reason to stay in Iraq. I don't agree with the US government's ideas for staying there. If they want to leave slowly, I wouldn't be against that. But I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. \n\nMany Iraqis want us to leave. We're helping them, but they're telling us to go. I think they know what's best for their country. If we listen to them and leave, we won't be responsible if things get worse. \n\nIf we help Iraq again after we leave, we might be seen as good people. We're not good people in the Middle East now, but it will be better than how things are today.",
            "There is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. \n\nI think this is true in many workplaces. Women often face more difficulties because of a glass ceiling. This is like a barrier that prevents them from getting to a higher position. Even if there is equality, people often have trouble working under a woman.\n\nThis is because society has been this way for a long time. Many women see a job they can do well, but the board may not choose them for the position. This is because women are not often in important jobs.\n\nThe same thing happens to men and other groups. For example, men who stay at home to care for children are often looked down upon. Society thinks men should be the breadwinners. This can be hard on these men because they want to take care of their children.\n\nIn the fashion industry, many people do not take men seriously if they are interested in fashion. This is because men who like fashion are often different. People do not understand their style.\n\nI think there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing this is hard because society has a strong idea of how things should be. We have made progress, but it is slow. Women are now in important jobs and men are staying home to care for children. This is changing people's views.\n\nWe need to promote the good qualities of people who are often discriminated against. We should not push too hard, or people will resist. I think we are at a good point where this is happening slowly. I do not know if there is anything else we can do.\n\nPeople from different places and with different backgrounds also face discrimination. For example, someone from a farm may not have perfect grammar, but they can be very smart. They may get a job as a CEO, but other men may not respect them because of their grammar.\n\nThis is another example of how people are often judged unfairly.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana is not fully legal. But some places have made it not a crime. This means it is not a serious offense like a crime. It is more like a traffic ticket. You get cited and do not get arrested.\n\nIf you get a citation for marijuana, it can affect your future. This can make it harder to get a job. But some people say it is better to not make it a crime. This is because it costs a lot of money to arrest and put people in jail. Then the court has to deal with the case. This costs even more money.\n\nSome cities do not have enough money. They do not want to make this change. But some cities, like Denver, are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea. They have more money to spend on important things like education and helping the elderly.\n\nI think it is a good idea. But marijuana must be used carefully. It should not be everywhere. There are good reasons to be careful. If it is allowed everywhere, people might smoke and drive. This is not safe.\n\nMarijuana can affect people in different ways. Some people are more careful and do not get into trouble. Others are not so careful. Alcohol can also be a problem. It can affect people's ability to think and move.\n\nI think people react differently to substances like marijuana and alcohol. Some people can use them without trouble. Others get into trouble. We should be careful and think about how substances affect us.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nMany things they do are old customs. \nThey have done these things for a long time. \nIt's good to have old traditions. \nBut it's also important to change. \nMany Catholics think they must go to church every week. \nThey are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel the Catholic Church is not kind to people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian, but my mom was a Catholic. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry my parents because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not being kind to other religions. \nWe learned to love others in Catholic school. \nBut it seems hypocritical to love others and not accept them. \n\nI think the Catholic rules tell you to do things. \nBut the way Catholics act goes against the rules. \nThe rules are old and need to change. \nBut they continue to keep them. \n\nI do not think this would make priests behave better. \nSome people who hurt children will do that even if they are married. \nIt's because they are hurting children, not because they are not married. \nSo, allowing priests to be married would not stop this behavior. \n\nIn my opinion, people who hurt children will do it anyway. \nIt's not because of marriage.",
            "I am having trouble making a decision on this issue. I do not know if one side is right or wrong. This is a very difficult topic. \n\nThe separation of church and state is a problem. Also, defining marriage is hard. We do not want to upset anyone. \n\nI do not know if the government should decide what a marriage is. Marriage is sometimes a sacrament. People get tax breaks if they are married. \n\nIf two people are married, the government should look at it like a civil union. It is the same for everyone. The government should not consider what kind of marriage it is. \n\nI think gay marriage is like any other marriage. Two people want to be together. They should have a civil union. \n\nIf all states agree, they should make it a law for the country. But a constitutional change to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue. \n\nThis issue is not important enough to change the constitution. We do not need to change the constitution to stop gay marriage. \n\nNo, I do not think so.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. This makes me think about gay marriage in a confusing way. I have many friends who are gay. I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think gay marriage should be allowed. It is not a national issue. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nMany states are democratic or republican. Democratic states often support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know its opinion. You chose to live there. So, it's not your place to disagree with its decision. I think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already said this. But I will say it again. I do not think the president should decide for the whole country. George Bush is not in every state. He should not decide how each state runs itself. Some things should be left to each state. He will be out of office soon. If a new president allows gay marriage, it will change again. Each state should decide for itself. They are the ones who will live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Myspace is a public place on the internet. You can see what others post there. School officials have the right to check it. They can see what students post, even if it's not under the school's name. They can see it when they are at home.\n\nIf school officials check Myspace to stop students from hurting themselves or others, that's okay. It's their job to keep students safe. They want to make sure students are not doing anything bad.\n\nSome people think it's an invasion of privacy when school officials check Myspace. But if it makes the school a safer place, it's not an invasion. School officials are just doing their job.\n\nWhen you post something on the internet, anyone can see it. You can't take it back. That's why you have to be careful what you say online. School officials can't help but see what students post. They want to keep students safe.\n\nSchools have rules and drills to keep students safe. They practice what to do in case of an emergency. School officials check Myspace to make sure students are not doing anything bad. They want to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nIn this case, school officials were just trying to keep students safe. They checked Myspace to see if students were doing anything bad. They want to make sure students are safe in school.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea. I was affected by 9/11. I thought we should go to their country and stop their violence. But I think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term effects.\n\nWe went to their country without a plan. I think that was a bad idea. It didn't work out well for us. I don't think we helped them. They will fight with each other, and they can't fight with us if they're busy fighting themselves.\n\nI'm not interested in their problems. They can solve their own problems. I think they're a different kind of people when it comes to war. We think war is bad, but they see it as a way to get what they want.\n\nWe went to their country thinking we could change their country. But I don't think that's possible. They will always be the way they are. We should have thought before we acted. We should have made a plan.\n\nI think we went to their country for revenge. President Bush wanted to go because people were angry after 9/11. I think he made a mistake, but I understand why he did it. We couldn't just let them do what they did and then do nothing.\n\nWe should have had a clear plan to create order in their country. But we didn't. We didn't know what we were doing. We didn't work together. That would have helped us.\n\nI don't think we should stay in their country. We've made some progress, but not enough. If we leave, their country will collapse. We can't stay there forever. It's not good for us to stay there. We should leave and let them solve their own problems."

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

But the Church is not changing. Many people disagree with the Church on these issues. They think the Church has the wrong view.\n\nIf you are for abortion or gay marriage, you may not want to be part of a Church that says these things are wrong. You might feel uncomfortable going against what the Church believes.\n\nThe Church does not want women priests. The Church says priests are married to God. But everyone has a family and other people they love. Priests should be able to have families and love their families too.\n\nThe Church should change its rules. Priests should be able to get married and have families. This would not hurt the Church. It would make priests happy and help them be good leaders.",

These are things people are born with.\n\nIt's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. This is not fair.\n\nThe federal government should not get involved in this issue. It's not a security issue or a moral issue. It's just about people being who they are.\n\nPeople are born gay. They shouldn't be punished for it. The government should not tell them they are wrong.\n\nThe government should not try to control people's private lives. They should let people be who they are.\n\nThis is just my opinion. I think it's fair to let everyone be equal.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There is no good reason not to.\n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to straight families. But this is not true. It's a different kind of love and family.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin. You can't compare them. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should have the right to own property and get medical care together.\n\nIf a gay person is sick, their partner can't visit them in the hospital. This is not fair. They should be able to be together.\n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are happy and successful. They have the same factors that make a relationship good.\n\nGay people are not asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government.\n\nThe government should not make laws based on one person's or group's religion. This is called separation of church and state.\n\nIf a couple has a civil union, why can't they get married? It's the same in many ways.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and children. But children of gay couples are the same as children of straight couples. They need love and care.\n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. They face problems in public schools.\n\nGay couples can be good parents. They can be involved in their community like straight couples.\n\nThe federal government should make gay marriage legal everywhere. The amendment that bans it is not fair.\n\nPresident Bush has strong opinions about this. He thinks it's against his religion. But morality is different for everyone.\n\nWe should not make laws just because some people don't like it. We should think about what's fair for everyone.\n\nSome people think gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true.

            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Just because a medicine is not allowed does not mean it has good effects. I think it is wrong to say it should be available to the public, but it may be good to use it for medical reasons.\n\nSome medicines are not allowed, but we use them in the pharmacy because they are good for people. For example, oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled medicines. We use them often because they help people. If people think marijuana is bad because it is not allowed, they should consider its good effects.\n\nMarijuana is not like alcohol. If you use too much of either, it can cause problems. However, it is not the same. I think we should not use it suddenly. Instead, we should make it clear that it is not bad, and people will use it responsibly.\n\nMany people think marijuana is bad because it is not allowed. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they may use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has changed over time to fit the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I grew up going to church every Sunday. I would wear nice clothes and shoes that matched. My church was in a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. They had a teenage mass that was shorter, only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually now, even for morning masses. They wear jeans and khakis. This is a big change. \n\nI don't think changing the rules, like allowing female priests or married priests, would have stopped the problems with some priests and children. Some men are married and still have these problems. It's not because they can or can't get married. It's because of who they are. \n\nThere are other religions where priests can be married. For example, some ministers in the Seventh Day Adventist church can get married. If they want to be married and practice their faith, they might choose a different church. \n\nI think the reason some priests did bad things is because of their own feelings, not because of their job. People are born with certain feelings, like being attracted to children. It's not because of how they were raised. The church couldn't have prevented these problems.\n\nIf some priests knew about the problems and kept it secret, that's wrong. But I don't think that's the case for all priests. \n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea at first, but I think many people were still upset after the 9/11 attacks. They used the 9/11 attacks as a reason to go to war in Iraq. But there were other reasons, not just the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe Bush administration said Saddam Hussein had arms of mass destruction, but this was not true. They connected Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks. This makes me very angry.\n\nThe Bush administration told many lies to the American people. They have not admitted to these lies. Colin Powell, a high official, said he was not sure about the evidence when he talked to the UN.\n\nI think this is very bad. It is against the law for government officials to lie. The Bush administration does not respect the law and the constitution. They have been trying to change the law since the 9/11 attacks.\n\nI think the Bush administration wanted to go to war from the beginning. The treasury secretary said this in a book. He said George Bush, the younger, wanted to go to war because his father was angry at Saddam Hussein. Bush wanted to increase the country's oil supply.\n\nThis is not a good way to make decisions. The war has lasted too long. If we leave now, there will be problems. The country might become very violent and many more people will die.\n\nThe UN and the US are trying to find a new way. They want a group of neighboring countries to help keep order. But this might not be a good idea. Iraq's freedom will be a big problem.\n\nThe news says the new government is not working well. The parliament is not effective and the prime minister does not have control. A man named Muqtada al-Sadr is still a problem. His party has many seats in the parliament.

            "I have thoughts about the war in Iraq. \n\nLet me think for a moment. \n\nIn my opinion, the war in Iraq is not very important. We did not declare war on Iraq officially. It seems like we went to war because we thought Iraq was involved in the 9/11 attacks. \n\nI am not very interested in the details of the war. But I know we are staying in Iraq to try to build a democracy. We also want to get oil from Iraq. \n\nBut I think we should not stay in Iraq. It makes many people unhappy. \n\nIf we stay, we will have to try to build democracy. This will take a long time. If we leave, the people in Iraq will be angry with us. They will have to start all over again. \n\nI do not know what to say about the war. It is a very difficult topic. \n\nI think the war in Iraq should continue, but it should not be called a war. We should not use guns to show that we are powerful. \n\nWe did not declare war on Iraq officially. A declared war needs the approval of Congress. \n\nI think we should try to help Iraq, but it is wasting our resources. It is also making President Bush look bad. \n\nThe Vietnam War was also an undeclared war. It is now called a meaningless war. \n\nI do not know what to say. It is hard to make a decision. \n\nThere are many families with sons and daughters in Iraq. I want them to be safe, but I also do not want to hurt the people of Iraq. \n\nIf we stay in Iraq, we will try to change their culture to be like ours. This will be bad for them. Their hate for the U.S. will grow, and the Al-Kaida group will get stronger. \n\nI think the war in Iraq will go on for a long time. It is a very complicated issue. \n\nThat is my opinion.",

This means the government should not control what churches do.\n\nThe constitution is clear on this. If we try to make a new law that says something is not allowed, it goes against what is already written. That is not right.\n\nSome people want to make it a law that one church's beliefs are more important than another's. Most Catholics and Christians do not agree with this idea. But it is not up to the government to decide what churches can or cannot do.\n\nThe separation of church and state is very important. It allows for freedom of religion in the United States. Some people want to change the constitution to make a new law. This would be wrong because it goes against what is already written.\n\nIt would be one of the only laws that restricts people, not the government. I don't think this is right.\n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this issue. The president is trying to make this law because it is against his own beliefs as a Catholic. This shows he has a preference for one religion over others. Churches should decide this, not the president or the government.\n\nThere is no good reason to make this law, except for personal opinions. It will not help the economy, and it may even help society.\n\nIn short, the government should not be involved in what churches do. The constitution is clear, and we should follow it.",
            "I want to talk about the war in Iraq.  The US government did not tell the American people the whole truth about why they wanted to go to war.  I think they used the attacks on September 11th to make people angry and want to fight.  But the two things were not connected.\n\nI am against war and especially going to war to attack first.  The war in Iraq was like the war in Vietnam.  The US should have learned from their mistakes in Vietnam.  In Vietnam, the US tried to put in a new government and it did not work.  Many American soldiers died in the war.\n\nThe US government took out the Iraqi government and wanted to put in a new one.  But they were not prepared for what would happen after that.  There was a lot of violence and chaos.  The US is still trying to help the Iraqis build a new government.\n\nI think the US government made a big mistake by going to war.  They did not plan for all the things that could happen.  The war has been going on for a long time and many American soldiers are still dying.  The US is trying to help the Iraqis learn to police their own country, but it is a slow process.\n\nI do not think the US government was honest with the American people about why they went to war.  They said it would be a short and easy war, but it has not been.  It takes a long time to build a new government and make it successful.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in a situation like this.  If the US went to war, they should finish what they started.  But we also have to think about the American soldiers who are dying.  Why are we helping Iraq and not other countries?  I think it is because of the oil in Iraq.\n\nThe US government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were not found.  We know North Korea has these weapons and we are not fighting them.  I do not think the US government is being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq.

You put something on the internet, and it affects how people think of you. If you talk about hurting people or things, someone will see it. \n\nThe internet is seen by everyone. If you are friends with someone on Myspace, you will see what they post. But it's not the school that sees it. Someone else sees it and tells the school.\n\nThe school must act on it. They can't ignore it in case something bad happens. They might be able to prevent it.\n\nBut it's hard to know what to take seriously. People sometimes joke online. Like what happened at my school.

They looked at the student's Facebook and found some things that might be jokes, but became serious in that situation.\n\nWhen you put something on the internet, there's no privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it. If you don't want someone to see it, don't post it.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on Myspace and Facebook.

            "I think the war has lasted too long. \n\nThe main reason was good at first - to give democracy to another country. \n\nBut now, I think we are fighting for different reasons.

We were involved in a disagreement with Saddam Hussein's country long ago. \n\nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country with no fair government, that would be a good reason.

            "I have a question about something. \n\nYou see, someone found out about this because they looked online. They went to a website and found some information. I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. If you put something on the internet, everyone can see it. \n\nOn a website called Myspace, you need to have a friend to see someone's profile. But when you accept someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see what you have on your profile. So, if you put something on the internet, many people may see it. \n\nI think it's good that someone found out about this. It may have saved a life. However, this is a problem. We can't have one person looking at everyone's online profiles all the time. That's not fair. \n\nWe can't have someone's job be to look at everyone's profiles. That would be wrong. But, it depends on the situation. If someone is looking for information to help someone, that's different. \n\nI have a Facebook account, but I don't have a Myspace account. I worry about people seeing things about me online. There are people who can get information easily. I saw a TV show about this. A man got a girl's screen name and was talking to her on instant messenger in a few minutes. \n\nIt's hard to protect your information online.

But it's hard because I want to be able to talk to my friends. \n\nI only accept people I know on Facebook. But you never know who can see what. My roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure if that was right. I don't know how the school had the right to tell students what to do.",
            "The Iraq War is a big issue. I want to talk about it again. \n\nSome people say I'm a hypocrite for talking about it. I was against the war at first. But now I think it's not very important. Most people in the world think the war was a bad idea. \n\nSurveys in the United States, Iraq, and many other countries show this. About 75 to 80 percent of people think the war was a bad idea. Even 80 percent of Iraqi people and 70 percent of US soldiers in Iraq think so. \n\nI think the war was a disaster from the start. It's hard to make good decisions when there's a big difference in culture between the US and the Middle East. \n\nWe tried to bring democracy to Iraq, but it's not what the people there wanted. Saddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the problems before going to war. \n\nNow, it's hard to find a good reason to stay in Iraq. I don't agree with the US government's ideas for staying there. If they want to leave slowly, I wouldn't be against that. But I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. \n\nMany Iraqis want us to leave. We're helping them, but they're telling us to go. I think they know what's best for their country. If we listen to them and leave, we won't be responsible if things get worse. \n\nIf we help Iraq again after we leave, we might be seen as good people. We're not good people in the Middle East now, but it will be better than how things are today.",
            "There is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. \n\nI think this is true in many workplaces. Women often face more difficulties because of a glass ceiling. This is like a barrier that prevents them from getting to a higher position. Even if there is equality, people often have trouble working under a woman.\n\nThis is because society has been this way for a long time. Many women see a job they can do well, but the board may not choose them for the position. This is because women are not often in important jobs.\n\nThe same thing happens to men and other groups. For example, men who stay at home to care for children are often looked down upon. Society thinks men should be the breadwinners. This can be hard on these men because they want to take care of their children.\n\nIn the fashion industry, many people do not take men seriously if they are interested in fashion. This is because men who like fashion are often different. People do not understand their style.\n\nI think there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing this is hard because society has a strong idea of how things should be. We have made progress, but it is slow. Women are now in important jobs and men are staying home to care for children. This is changing people's views.\n\nWe need to promote the good qualities of people who are often discriminated against. We should not push too hard, or people will resist. I think we are at a good point where this is happening slowly. I do not know if there is anything else we can do.\n\nPeople from different places and with different backgrounds also face discrimination. For example, someone from a farm may not have perfect grammar, but they can be very smart. They may get a job as a CEO, but other men may not respect them because of their grammar.\n\nThis is another example of how people are often judged unfairly.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana is not fully legal. But some places have made it not a crime. This means it is not a serious offense like a crime. It is more like a traffic ticket. You get cited and do not get arrested.\n\nIf you get a citation for marijuana, it can affect your future. This can make it harder to get a job. But some people say it is better to not make it a crime. This is because it costs a lot of money to arrest and put people in jail. Then the court has to deal with the case. This costs even more money.\n\nSome cities do not have enough money. They do not want to make this change. But some cities, like Denver, are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea. They have more money to spend on important things like education and helping the elderly.\n\nI think it is a good idea. But marijuana must be used carefully. It should not be everywhere. There are good reasons to be careful. If it is allowed everywhere, people might smoke and drive. This is not safe.\n\nMarijuana can affect people in different ways. Some people are more careful and do not get into trouble. Others are not so careful. Alcohol can also be a problem. It can affect people's ability to think and move.\n\nI think people react differently to substances like marijuana and alcohol. Some people can use them without trouble. Others get into trouble. We should be careful and think about how substances affect us.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nMany things they do are old customs. \nThey have done these things for a long time. \nIt's good to have old traditions. \nBut it's also important to change. \nMany Catholics think they must go to church every week. \nThey are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel the Catholic Church is not kind to people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian, but my mom was a Catholic. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry my parents because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not being kind to other religions. \nWe learned to love others in Catholic school. \nBut it seems hypocritical to love others and not accept them. \n\nI think the Catholic rules tell you to do things. \nBut the way Catholics act goes against the rules. \nThe rules are old and need to change. \nBut they continue to keep them. \n\nI do not think this would make priests behave better. \nSome people who hurt children will do that even if they are married. \nIt's because they are hurting children, not because they are not married. \nSo, allowing priests to be married would not stop this behavior. \n\nIn my opinion, people who hurt children will do it anyway. \nIt's not because of marriage.",
            "I am having trouble making a decision on this issue. I do not know if one side is right or wrong. This is a very difficult topic. \n\nThe separation of church and state is a problem. Also, defining marriage is hard. We do not want to upset anyone. \n\nI do not know if the government should decide what a marriage is. Marriage is sometimes a sacrament. People get tax breaks if they are married. \n\nIf two people are married, the government should look at it like a civil union. It is the same for everyone. The government should not consider what kind of marriage it is. \n\nI think gay marriage is like any other marriage. Two people want to be together. They should have a civil union. \n\nIf all states agree, they should make it a law for the country. But a constitutional change to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue. \n\nThis issue is not important enough to change the constitution. We do not need to change the constitution to stop gay marriage. \n\nNo, I do not think so.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. This makes me think about gay marriage in a confusing way. I have many friends who are gay. I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think gay marriage should be allowed. It is not a national issue. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nMany states are democratic or republican. Democratic states often support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know its opinion. You chose to live there. So, it's not your place to disagree with its decision. I think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already said this. But I will say it again. I do not think the president should decide for the whole country. George Bush is not in every state. He should not decide how each state runs itself. Some things should be left to each state. He will be out of office soon. If a new president allows gay marriage, it will change again. Each state should decide for itself. They are the ones who will live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Myspace is a public place on the internet. You can see what others post there. School officials have the right to check it. They can see what students post, even if it's not under the school's name. They can see it when they are at home.\n\nIf school officials check Myspace to stop students from hurting themselves or others, that's okay. It's their job to keep students safe. They want to make sure students are not doing anything bad.\n\nSome people think it's an invasion of privacy when school officials check Myspace. But if it makes the school a safer place, it's not an invasion. School officials are just doing their job.\n\nWhen you post something on the internet, anyone can see it. You can't take it back. That's why you have to be careful what you say online. School officials can't help but see what students post. They want to keep students safe.\n\nSchools have rules and drills to keep students safe. They practice what to do in case of an emergency. School officials check Myspace to make sure students are not doing anything bad. They want to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nIn this case, school officials were just trying to keep students safe. They checked Myspace to see if students were doing anything bad. They want to make sure students are safe in school.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea. I was affected by 9/11. I thought we should go to their country and stop their violence. But I think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term effects.\n\nWe went to their country without a plan. I think that was a bad idea. It didn't work out well for us. I don't think we helped them. They will fight with each other, and they can't fight with us if they're busy fighting themselves.\n\nI'm not interested in their problems. They can solve their own problems. I think they're a different kind of people when it comes to war. We think war is bad, but they see it as a way to get what they want.\n\nWe went to their country thinking we could change their country. But I don't think that's possible. They will always be the way they are. We should have thought before we acted. We should have made a plan.\n\nI think we went to their country for revenge. President Bush wanted to go because people were angry after 9/11. I think he made a mistake, but I understand why he did it. We couldn't just let them do what they did and then do nothing.\n\nWe should have had a clear plan to create order in their country. But we didn't. We didn't know what we were doing. We didn't work together. That would have helped us.\n\nI don't think we should stay in their country. We've made some progress, but not enough. If we leave, their country will collapse. We can't stay there forever. It's not good for us to stay there. We should leave and let them solve their own problems."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

But the Church is not changing. Many people disagree with the Church on these issues. They think the Church has the wrong view.\n\nIf you are for abortion or gay marriage, you may not want to be part of a Church that says these things are wrong. You might feel uncomfortable going against what the Church believes.\n\nThe Church does not want women priests. The Church says priests are married to God. But everyone has a family and other people they love. Priests should be able to have families and love their families too.\n\nThe Church should change its rules. Priests should be able to get married and have families. This would not hurt the Church. It would make priests happy and help them be good leaders.",

These are things people are born with.\n\nIt's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. This is not fair.\n\nThe federal government should not get involved in this issue. It's not a security issue or a moral issue. It's just about people being who they are.\n\nPeople are born gay. They shouldn't be punished for it. The government should not tell them they are wrong.\n\nThe government should not try to control people's private lives. They should let people be who they are.\n\nThis is just my opinion. I think it's fair to let everyone be equal.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There is no good reason not to.\n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to straight families. But this is not true. It's a different kind of love and family.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin. You can't compare them. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should have the right to own property and get medical care together.\n\nIf a gay person is sick, their partner can't visit them in the hospital. This is not fair. They should be able to be together.\n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are happy and successful. They have the same factors that make a relationship good.\n\nGay people are not asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government.\n\nThe government should not make laws based on one person's or group's religion. This is called separation of church and state.\n\nIf a couple has a civil union, why can't they get married? It's the same in many ways.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and children. But children of gay couples are the same as children of straight couples. They need love and care.\n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. They face problems in public schools.\n\nGay couples can be good parents. They can be involved in their community like straight couples.\n\nThe federal government should make gay marriage legal everywhere. The amendment that bans it is not fair.\n\nPresident Bush has strong opinions about this. He thinks it's against his religion. But morality is different for everyone.\n\nWe should not make laws just because some people don't like it. We should think about what's fair for everyone.\n\nSome people think gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true.

            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Just because a medicine is not allowed does not mean it has good effects. I think it is wrong to say it should be available to the public, but it may be good to use it for medical reasons.\n\nSome medicines are not allowed, but we use them in the pharmacy because they are good for people. For example, oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled medicines. We use them often because they help people. If people think marijuana is bad because it is not allowed, they should consider its good effects.\n\nMarijuana is not like alcohol. If you use too much of either, it can cause problems. However, it is not the same. I think we should not use it suddenly. Instead, we should make it clear that it is not bad, and people will use it responsibly.\n\nMany people think marijuana is bad because it is not allowed. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they may use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has changed over time to fit the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I grew up going to church every Sunday. I would wear nice clothes and shoes that matched. My church was in a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. They had a teenage mass that was shorter, only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually now, even for morning masses. They wear jeans and khakis. This is a big change. \n\nI don't think changing the rules, like allowing female priests or married priests, would have stopped the problems with some priests and children. Some men are married and still have these problems. It's not because they can or can't get married. It's because of who they are. \n\nThere are other religions where priests can be married. For example, some ministers in the Seventh Day Adventist church can get married. If they want to be married and practice their faith, they might choose a different church. \n\nI think the reason some priests did bad things is because of their own feelings, not because of their job. People are born with certain feelings, like being attracted to children. It's not because of how they were raised. The church couldn't have prevented these problems.\n\nIf some priests knew about the problems and kept it secret, that's wrong. But I don't think that's the case for all priests. \n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea at first, but I think many people were still upset after the 9/11 attacks. They used the 9/11 attacks as a reason to go to war in Iraq. But there were other reasons, not just the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe Bush administration said Saddam Hussein had arms of mass destruction, but this was not true. They connected Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks. This makes me very angry.\n\nThe Bush administration told many lies to the American people. They have not admitted to these lies. Colin Powell, a high official, said he was not sure about the evidence when he talked to the UN.\n\nI think this is very bad. It is against the law for government officials to lie. The Bush administration does not respect the law and the constitution. They have been trying to change the law since the 9/11 attacks.\n\nI think the Bush administration wanted to go to war from the beginning. The treasury secretary said this in a book. He said George Bush, the younger, wanted to go to war because his father was angry at Saddam Hussein. Bush wanted to increase the country's oil supply.\n\nThis is not a good way to make decisions. The war has lasted too long. If we leave now, there will be problems. The country might become very violent and many more people will die.\n\nThe UN and the US are trying to find a new way. They want a group of neighboring countries to help keep order. But this might not be a good idea. Iraq's freedom will be a big problem.\n\nThe news says the new government is not working well. The parliament is not effective and the prime minister does not have control. A man named Muqtada al-Sadr is still a problem. His party has many seats in the parliament.

            "I have thoughts about the war in Iraq. \n\nLet me think for a moment. \n\nIn my opinion, the war in Iraq is not very important. We did not declare war on Iraq officially. It seems like we went to war because we thought Iraq was involved in the 9/11 attacks. \n\nI am not very interested in the details of the war. But I know we are staying in Iraq to try to build a democracy. We also want to get oil from Iraq. \n\nBut I think we should not stay in Iraq. It makes many people unhappy. \n\nIf we stay, we will have to try to build democracy. This will take a long time. If we leave, the people in Iraq will be angry with us. They will have to start all over again. \n\nI do not know what to say about the war. It is a very difficult topic. \n\nI think the war in Iraq should continue, but it should not be called a war. We should not use guns to show that we are powerful. \n\nWe did not declare war on Iraq officially. A declared war needs the approval of Congress. \n\nI think we should try to help Iraq, but it is wasting our resources. It is also making President Bush look bad. \n\nThe Vietnam War was also an undeclared war. It is now called a meaningless war. \n\nI do not know what to say. It is hard to make a decision. \n\nThere are many families with sons and daughters in Iraq. I want them to be safe, but I also do not want to hurt the people of Iraq. \n\nIf we stay in Iraq, we will try to change their culture to be like ours. This will be bad for them. Their hate for the U.S. will grow, and the Al-Kaida group will get stronger. \n\nI think the war in Iraq will go on for a long time. It is a very complicated issue. \n\nThat is my opinion.",

This means the government should not control what churches do.\n\nThe constitution is clear on this. If we try to make a new law that says something is not allowed, it goes against what is already written. That is not right.\n\nSome people want to make it a law that one church's beliefs are more important than another's. Most Catholics and Christians do not agree with this idea. But it is not up to the government to decide what churches can or cannot do.\n\nThe separation of church and state is very important. It allows for freedom of religion in the United States. Some people want to change the constitution to make a new law. This would be wrong because it goes against what is already written.\n\nIt would be one of the only laws that restricts people, not the government. I don't think this is right.\n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this issue. The president is trying to make this law because it is against his own beliefs as a Catholic. This shows he has a preference for one religion over others. Churches should decide this, not the president or the government.\n\nThere is no good reason to make this law, except for personal opinions. It will not help the economy, and it may even help society.\n\nIn short, the government should not be involved in what churches do. The constitution is clear, and we should follow it.",
            "I want to talk about the war in Iraq.  The US government did not tell the American people the whole truth about why they wanted to go to war.  I think they used the attacks on September 11th to make people angry and want to fight.  But the two things were not connected.\n\nI am against war and especially going to war to attack first.  The war in Iraq was like the war in Vietnam.  The US should have learned from their mistakes in Vietnam.  In Vietnam, the US tried to put in a new government and it did not work.  Many American soldiers died in the war.\n\nThe US government took out the Iraqi government and wanted to put in a new one.  But they were not prepared for what would happen after that.  There was a lot of violence and chaos.  The US is still trying to help the Iraqis build a new government.\n\nI think the US government made a big mistake by going to war.  They did not plan for all the things that could happen.  The war has been going on for a long time and many American soldiers are still dying.  The US is trying to help the Iraqis learn to police their own country, but it is a slow process.\n\nI do not think the US government was honest with the American people about why they went to war.  They said it would be a short and easy war, but it has not been.  It takes a long time to build a new government and make it successful.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in a situation like this.  If the US went to war, they should finish what they started.  But we also have to think about the American soldiers who are dying.  Why are we helping Iraq and not other countries?  I think it is because of the oil in Iraq.\n\nThe US government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were not found.  We know North Korea has these weapons and we are not fighting them.  I do not think the US government is being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq.

You put something on the internet, and it affects how people think of you. If you talk about hurting people or things, someone will see it. \n\nThe internet is seen by everyone. If you are friends with someone on Myspace, you will see what they post. But it's not the school that sees it. Someone else sees it and tells the school.\n\nThe school must act on it. They can't ignore it in case something bad happens. They might be able to prevent it.\n\nBut it's hard to know what to take seriously. People sometimes joke online. Like what happened at my school.

They looked at the student's Facebook and found some things that might be jokes, but became serious in that situation.\n\nWhen you put something on the internet, there's no privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it. If you don't want someone to see it, don't post it.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on Myspace and Facebook.

            "I think the war has lasted too long. \n\nThe main reason was good at first - to give democracy to another country. \n\nBut now, I think we are fighting for different reasons.

We were involved in a disagreement with Saddam Hussein's country long ago. \n\nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country with no fair government, that would be a good reason.

            "I have a question about something. \n\nYou see, someone found out about this because they looked online. They went to a website and found some information. I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. If you put something on the internet, everyone can see it. \n\nOn a website called Myspace, you need to have a friend to see someone's profile. But when you accept someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see what you have on your profile. So, if you put something on the internet, many people may see it. \n\nI think it's good that someone found out about this. It may have saved a life. However, this is a problem. We can't have one person looking at everyone's online profiles all the time. That's not fair. \n\nWe can't have someone's job be to look at everyone's profiles. That would be wrong. But, it depends on the situation. If someone is looking for information to help someone, that's different. \n\nI have a Facebook account, but I don't have a Myspace account. I worry about people seeing things about me online. There are people who can get information easily. I saw a TV show about this. A man got a girl's screen name and was talking to her on instant messenger in a few minutes. \n\nIt's hard to protect your information online.

But it's hard because I want to be able to talk to my friends. \n\nI only accept people I know on Facebook. But you never know who can see what. My roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure if that was right. I don't know how the school had the right to tell students what to do.",
            "The Iraq War is a big issue. I want to talk about it again. \n\nSome people say I'm a hypocrite for talking about it. I was against the war at first. But now I think it's not very important. Most people in the world think the war was a bad idea. \n\nSurveys in the United States, Iraq, and many other countries show this. About 75 to 80 percent of people think the war was a bad idea. Even 80 percent of Iraqi people and 70 percent of US soldiers in Iraq think so. \n\nI think the war was a disaster from the start. It's hard to make good decisions when there's a big difference in culture between the US and the Middle East. \n\nWe tried to bring democracy to Iraq, but it's not what the people there wanted. Saddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the problems before going to war. \n\nNow, it's hard to find a good reason to stay in Iraq. I don't agree with the US government's ideas for staying there. If they want to leave slowly, I wouldn't be against that. But I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. \n\nMany Iraqis want us to leave. We're helping them, but they're telling us to go. I think they know what's best for their country. If we listen to them and leave, we won't be responsible if things get worse. \n\nIf we help Iraq again after we leave, we might be seen as good people. We're not good people in the Middle East now, but it will be better than how things are today.",
            "There is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. \n\nI think this is true in many workplaces. Women often face more difficulties because of a glass ceiling. This is like a barrier that prevents them from getting to a higher position. Even if there is equality, people often have trouble working under a woman.\n\nThis is because society has been this way for a long time. Many women see a job they can do well, but the board may not choose them for the position. This is because women are not often in important jobs.\n\nThe same thing happens to men and other groups. For example, men who stay at home to care for children are often looked down upon. Society thinks men should be the breadwinners. This can be hard on these men because they want to take care of their children.\n\nIn the fashion industry, many people do not take men seriously if they are interested in fashion. This is because men who like fashion are often different. People do not understand their style.\n\nI think there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing this is hard because society has a strong idea of how things should be. We have made progress, but it is slow. Women are now in important jobs and men are staying home to care for children. This is changing people's views.\n\nWe need to promote the good qualities of people who are often discriminated against. We should not push too hard, or people will resist. I think we are at a good point where this is happening slowly. I do not know if there is anything else we can do.\n\nPeople from different places and with different backgrounds also face discrimination. For example, someone from a farm may not have perfect grammar, but they can be very smart. They may get a job as a CEO, but other men may not respect them because of their grammar.\n\nThis is another example of how people are often judged unfairly.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana is not fully legal. But some places have made it not a crime. This means it is not a serious offense like a crime. It is more like a traffic ticket. You get cited and do not get arrested.\n\nIf you get a citation for marijuana, it can affect your future. This can make it harder to get a job. But some people say it is better to not make it a crime. This is because it costs a lot of money to arrest and put people in jail. Then the court has to deal with the case. This costs even more money.\n\nSome cities do not have enough money. They do not want to make this change. But some cities, like Denver, are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea. They have more money to spend on important things like education and helping the elderly.\n\nI think it is a good idea. But marijuana must be used carefully. It should not be everywhere. There are good reasons to be careful. If it is allowed everywhere, people might smoke and drive. This is not safe.\n\nMarijuana can affect people in different ways. Some people are more careful and do not get into trouble. Others are not so careful. Alcohol can also be a problem. It can affect people's ability to think and move.\n\nI think people react differently to substances like marijuana and alcohol. Some people can use them without trouble. Others get into trouble. We should be careful and think about how substances affect us.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nMany things they do are old customs. \nThey have done these things for a long time. \nIt's good to have old traditions. \nBut it's also important to change. \nMany Catholics think they must go to church every week. \nThey are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel the Catholic Church is not kind to people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian, but my mom was a Catholic. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry my parents because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not being kind to other religions. \nWe learned to love others in Catholic school. \nBut it seems hypocritical to love others and not accept them. \n\nI think the Catholic rules tell you to do things. \nBut the way Catholics act goes against the rules. \nThe rules are old and need to change. \nBut they continue to keep them. \n\nI do not think this would make priests behave better. \nSome people who hurt children will do that even if they are married. \nIt's because they are hurting children, not because they are not married. \nSo, allowing priests to be married would not stop this behavior. \n\nIn my opinion, people who hurt children will do it anyway. \nIt's not because of marriage.",
            "I am having trouble making a decision on this issue. I do not know if one side is right or wrong. This is a very difficult topic. \n\nThe separation of church and state is a problem. Also, defining marriage is hard. We do not want to upset anyone. \n\nI do not know if the government should decide what a marriage is. Marriage is sometimes a sacrament. People get tax breaks if they are married. \n\nIf two people are married, the government should look at it like a civil union. It is the same for everyone. The government should not consider what kind of marriage it is. \n\nI think gay marriage is like any other marriage. Two people want to be together. They should have a civil union. \n\nIf all states agree, they should make it a law for the country. But a constitutional change to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue. \n\nThis issue is not important enough to change the constitution. We do not need to change the constitution to stop gay marriage. \n\nNo, I do not think so.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. This makes me think about gay marriage in a confusing way. I have many friends who are gay. I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think gay marriage should be allowed. It is not a national issue. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nMany states are democratic or republican. Democratic states often support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know its opinion. You chose to live there. So, it's not your place to disagree with its decision. I think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already said this. But I will say it again. I do not think the president should decide for the whole country. George Bush is not in every state. He should not decide how each state runs itself. Some things should be left to each state. He will be out of office soon. If a new president allows gay marriage, it will change again. Each state should decide for itself. They are the ones who will live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Myspace is a public place on the internet. You can see what others post there. School officials have the right to check it. They can see what students post, even if it's not under the school's name. They can see it when they are at home.\n\nIf school officials check Myspace to stop students from hurting themselves or others, that's okay. It's their job to keep students safe. They want to make sure students are not doing anything bad.\n\nSome people think it's an invasion of privacy when school officials check Myspace. But if it makes the school a safer place, it's not an invasion. School officials are just doing their job.\n\nWhen you post something on the internet, anyone can see it. You can't take it back. That's why you have to be careful what you say online. School officials can't help but see what students post. They want to keep students safe.\n\nSchools have rules and drills to keep students safe. They practice what to do in case of an emergency. School officials check Myspace to make sure students are not doing anything bad. They want to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nIn this case, school officials were just trying to keep students safe. They checked Myspace to see if students were doing anything bad. They want to make sure students are safe in school.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea. I was affected by 9/11. I thought we should go to their country and stop their violence. But I think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term effects.\n\nWe went to their country without a plan. I think that was a bad idea. It didn't work out well for us. I don't think we helped them. They will fight with each other, and they can't fight with us if they're busy fighting themselves.\n\nI'm not interested in their problems. They can solve their own problems. I think they're a different kind of people when it comes to war. We think war is bad, but they see it as a way to get what they want.\n\nWe went to their country thinking we could change their country. But I don't think that's possible. They will always be the way they are. We should have thought before we acted. We should have made a plan.\n\nI think we went to their country for revenge. President Bush wanted to go because people were angry after 9/11. I think he made a mistake, but I understand why he did it. We couldn't just let them do what they did and then do nothing.\n\nWe should have had a clear plan to create order in their country. But we didn't. We didn't know what we were doing. We didn't work together. That would have helped us.\n\nI don't think we should stay in their country. We've made some progress, but not enough. If we leave, their country will collapse. We can't stay there forever. It's not good for us to stay there. We should leave and let them solve their own problems."
