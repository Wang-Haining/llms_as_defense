            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

Some people do not want to be part of a church that does not agree with their ideas. The Catholic Church is against abortion. If you support abortion, you may not want to be part of a church that says it is wrong.\n\nThe same is true for gay marriage and other issues. If you disagree with the Catholic Church's views, you may not want to be part of the church. The Catholic Church does not allow women to be priests or for priests to be married.

            "I think gay marriage should be legal. \n\nThere is no good reason it should not be. \n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. \n\nIt's different. Similar to how two sides of a coin are different but equal. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. Like paying taxes and getting health care. \n\nBut now, if you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or make decisions for you. \n\nThis is not fair. Many studies show that gay couples have the same rates of success as straight couples. They have the same things that make a happy relationship. \n\nIt's just a relationship. The same as any other. \n\nThe problem is that people get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. But gay couples are only asking for a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government allows a civil union, why not a marriage? \n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. \n\nGay couples are the same in many ways. They have the same roles in a relationship. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and how it will affect the community. \n\nThey also worry about children of gay couples. Will they be treated unfairly by their peers and other adults? \n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they get bullied in regular schools. \n\nParents protest to take the child out of school. \n\nThis is not fair to the child. Parenting skills are the same for gay and straight couples. \n\nThe government should help make gay marriage legal in all states. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, based on his religion. But morality is different for everyone. \n\nThe government should not make laws based on one group's morality. It's not fair to ignore the culture and morality of others. \n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they believe being gay is a choice or a defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. \n\nWe should listen to experts, not just what our friends and neighbors say.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. I know some people think that because a drug is against the law, it cannot be good.

I do not think it should be available to everyone.\n\nBut, if a doctor says it can help someone, I think it should be used. Just because a drug is against the law does not mean it is bad. Many medicines are against the law, but doctors use them to help people. \n\nFor example, oxycodone and Vicodin are against the law, but they are used in pharmacies because they are helpful. If people think marijuana is bad just because it is against the law, it is not fair. We should think about its good properties.\n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If people drink too much alcohol, it can be bad for them. But if people use marijuana too much, it is not as bad. Maybe we should make marijuana legal, but not all at once. We should help people understand that it is not a bad thing.\n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine.

            "I think the church has changed to fit modern times. It is not as strict as it was in the past. When I was a child, I went to church every Sunday. I wore a new dress and matching shoes and handbag. It was a special part of my life. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nThe church now has a shorter service on Sundays, only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes and sometimes arrive late. This makes the church feel more relaxed.\n\nI also notice that people wear jeans and khaki pants to morning services. It's a big change from when I wore dresses and skirts. But it's not all bad – khaki pants are nice too.\n\nI don't know much about the church's rules and politics. But I think the church has become more casual.\n\nRegarding the problem of Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't think changing rules would have stopped it. Some men become pedophiles because of their genetics, not because of their choices. Even married men can become pedophiles. It's not because they are allowed to get married or not.\n\nSome religions allow their priests to get married, like Seventh-day Adventists. But even in those cases, some men still become pedophiles. I think it's the person's choice, not their faith, that makes them a pedophile.\n\nI think genetics play a big role in making people become pedophiles. It's not something they choose or learn. It's who they are. You can't change someone's genetics, even with a marriage.\n\nIf the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, that's wrong. But I don't think they always knew. If they did, they should have acted.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic church.",
            "The Iraq war is a very serious issue. I was not happy with the reason we went to war. The 9/11 attacks happened in September. Many people were still upset. I think the Bush administration used the Iraq war as an excuse. They said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but this was not true.\n\nI think the Bush administration lied to the American people.

It is against the law for a president to lie to the people.\n\nI think the Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution. They have tried to make it weaker since 9/11.

He said the younger Bush wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein because his father was mad at him.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If we leave now, many more people will die. The country may fall into civil war. The UN and the US are trying to find a new way. They want other countries in the area to help restore order. But I am not sure this is a good idea. Iraq will have trouble being a free country if other countries control it.\n\nThe government in Iraq is not working well. The Parliament is not effective. The Prime Minister does not have control.

The person in charge, President Bush, is looking bad because of the war. It is like the Vietnam War, which was also not declared as a war and was not successful.\n\nI know people who have family members in Iraq. Some of these family members are fighting in the war.

            "I don't think it's right for a state to make a law about something that is against a church's rules. The constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control what churches do.

It would be like the government saying, \"We don't like your church's rules, so we will make a new law to stop you.\"\n\nSome people want to make a law against this, but I think that's not fair.

If the government makes a law about this, it would be wrong. It would be against what is already written in the constitution.\n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this issue. The president is trying to make a law because of his own personal beliefs. He is showing that he prefers one religion over others. This is not fair.\n\nThere is no good reason for a law against this.

            "The war in Iraq was a difficult and complicated issue. I think the US government was not honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, I believe the government tried to connect the war in Iraq to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. However, this connection was not clear.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq was similar to the Vietnam War. The US government did not learn from past mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government, but the government was not prepared for the consequences. \n\nThe aftermath of the war was chaotic and violent. The US tried to put a democratic government in Iraq, but this was not an easy task. It took years to implement a new form of government. In the US, it took a long time to establish a strong democracy.\n\nThe US government should have been more careful and prepared before invading Iraq. They should have thought about all possible outcomes. The government was not honest with the American people about the war. They made the war seem like a quick and easy victory.\n\nThe US government should not have gone to war without a clear plan. Many American troops are still dying in Iraq. The US is trying to train the Iraqi military and police to control their country. This is a long and difficult process.\n\nThe government made it seem like the war would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. However, this was not true. Implementing a new form of government takes a long time. It was not an easy thing to do in the US, and it will not be easy in Iraq.\n\nThe war in Iraq was a difficult decision. I had mixed feelings about it. In the 2004 presidential election, one of my reasons for voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, I now think that the US should try to leave Iraq, but it is hard because the US took away their government and way of life.\n\nThe US should consider the many American casualties and whether it is worth risking more lives for a free democratic Iraq. If we are invading Iraq to make it a democracy, why not help other countries? The main reason is oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. Another reason for the war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there will be peace.

            "I support gay marriage. I have always supported it. It is a personal preference. Some people think it may be caused by biology, not by how we are raised. This means we should not give people fewer rights because of something they cannot control.\n\nI think it is wrong to deny people rights because of their personal life. People who love each other should be able to get married. This is not just a state or government issue, it is a personal issue.\n\nIn my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed to be. But they live like any other family. They walk their dogs like everyone else. I think it is not right for the government to decide what marriage is.\n\nResearch shows that being gay may be caused by something in the brain. People may be born this way. It is not because of how they are raised or their family.\n\nMarriage is a personal thing. If two people want to get married, they should be able to do it quietly, like anyone else. But if gay people want to get married, it becomes a big issue. This is not right. Marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.\n\nI do not think the government should decide who can get married and who cannot. This is a personal choice.",

The school looked at the student's Facebook page and found some things that were not good. They looked serious because of the situation.\n\nWhen you put something on the internet, you cannot control who sees it. If you do not want people to know something, do not post it online. You cannot tell people what to think or what to take seriously.\n\nSchool officials should not friend students on the internet. However, if a student tells them something, they must take it seriously. But they should not be monitoring students' phone conversations or texts. If something is brought to their attention, it is a different situation.\n\nAs a resident assistant, I do not friend my residents on the internet. I do not want to know about their private lives. I do not want to have to deal with their problems.",
            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe original goal was good - to bring democracy to a country without a fair government. \nBut we have lost sight of this goal. \nNow, it seems we are fighting just to show our power. \n\nThe reasons for the war were questionable from the start. \nGeorge Bush's father had disagreements with Saddam Hussein in the past. \nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country ruled by a dictator, that would be a fair reason for war. \nBut personal reasons would not be fair. \n\nI think we made our point in the first few months of the war. \nStarting the war was a strong statement. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nThis is too long.\n\nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a good reason for war. \nBut our reasons have changed over time. \nNow, it seems we are fighting just to fight. \nWe do not want to end the war without winning. \n\nThe war has lasted too long. \nTheir government should take care of itself now. \nWe have spent billions of dollars on this war. \nWe have our own problems, like poverty and bad roads. \nWe should spend our money on these problems. \n\nWe are spending too much money on the war. \nWe should use this money for things like health care and schools. \nMany of our citizens are dying in this war. \nWe are losing the reason for fighting. \n\nI think that is my opinion.",
            "I have a question. I was thinking about the fact that someone went online and saw something. This made a bad thing not happen. The person was on a website called Myspace. If you put information on the internet, it can be seen by many people. On Myspace, you need a friend to see someone's profile. But when you make someone a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information. So, if you put information on the internet, you should expect that many people will see it.\n\nThis is a difficult problem. If someone is watching students' profiles to prevent bad things, it's not fair to just look at certain students. But if someone sees something bad by chance, it's good that they can stop it. It depends on why they were looking at the profile.\n\nI have a Facebook account, but not a Myspace one. I know there are bad people who can see things about me. I saw a story on TV about a man who got information easily from someone's profile. He contacted her on instant messenger and she met him. I would not do that. Some people in my classes know me without knowing my name on the internet. They can find out where I am and who my friends are. It's hard to keep my personal things private.\n\nI limit what I put on the internet, but I also want to communicate with friends. I only accept friends I know. But I'm not sure who can see what.\n\nMy roommate told me about a school that banned Myspace. I don't know if this is a privacy issue. I don't know if the school had the right to tell students they couldn't have Myspace. That's my only other thought.",
            "The Iraq War is a big problem. I want to talk about it. I feel strange saying I was against it from the start. Many people agree it was a bad idea. Most people in the United States, Iraq, and the world think so. \n\nAccording to polls, about 75 to 80 percent of people think the war was a bad idea. In Iraq, 80 percent of people agree. Even 70 percent of US troops in Iraq think it was a mistake. They think the US should leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq is very bad. It was a problem before the US entered. Now, pulling out of Iraq will be difficult too. There is a big cultural difference between the US and countries in the Middle East. The US thinks it can bring democracy to these countries. However, this is not what the people want. Saddam was a bad leader, but you must think carefully before invading a country.\n\nI do not see a good reason for staying in Iraq. I have not heard a good reason to stay longer. If the US wants to leave slowly over time, I would not be against it. But I do not see a reason to stay.\n\nI read that 80 percent of Iraqis want the US to leave within a year. Some Iraqis even want the US to leave now. These are the people we want to help. Maybe they know what is best for them. If we ask them and they say they want us to leave, then we cannot blame them if things get worse.\n\nIf we leave, we can say we tried to help. If we decide to help them after that, we will be seen as good people. Not really, but it will be better than now.",
            "Gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It is not just for women. It also happens in the workplace. The field of work can make a difference. For example, in some jobs, people might think it is hard for a woman to be in charge. This is because society has a long history. In the past, women did not usually hold important positions.\n\nIn many places, people think it is strange for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. This is not always true. Some men want to be at home with their children. But society does not always accept this. People might think, \"Men should work and earn money for their families.\" This can be hard for men who choose to stay at home.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men may not be taken seriously if they like fashion. Some people think men who like fashion are not typical. They might think, \"How can a man know about fashion for women?\" This is a problem because it is not true. Men can know a lot about fashion.\n\nChange is slow. It takes time. But things are getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and getting important jobs. People are starting to accept this. It is also becoming more accepted for men to stay at home and take care of their children. \n\nWe need to promote the qualities of people who are often discriminated against. We should show their good qualities without being too pushy. If we force people to accept change, they might resist. We have made progress, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can be discriminated against based on their job, where they are from, or their gender. For example, someone from a farm might not have good grammar, but they might be very intelligent. They might work their way up to a CEO position. However, other men might think, \"How can I know if you are smart if you don't speak well?\"\n\nIn short, gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It affects women and men in different ways. It also affects people based on their job and where they are from.",
            "My understanding is that they did not make marijuana a crime.  Instead, they made it a minor offense.  You can get a ticket for it, but you will not be arrested.  This is a change from the past when it was a serious crime.\n\nSome people worry about the future problems that come with a marijuana charge, even if it is not a crime.  But there are two sides to this issue.  One side is that it costs a lot of money to arrest and try people for marijuana offenses.  This money could be used for other important things like education and helping the poor.\n\nIn some cities, people are against making marijuana legal because they do not want it to be easily available.  But in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded.  They think making marijuana legal is a good idea because it can bring in money for important programs.\n\nHowever, if marijuana were totally legal, it could be sold in stores like cigarettes.  This might lead to people smoking and driving, which is a problem.  Some people also think it would be uncomfortable to have marijuana out in the open.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol can cause problems.  Marijuana can affect people's lifestyles, and alcohol can affect their driving and decision-making.  Everyone reacts differently to substances, and some people have trouble controlling themselves.\n\nI think it is hard to say what the effects of marijuana will be because people react differently.  But I do think that both marijuana and alcohol have their own problems.",
            "I agree. \n\nBecause I think some things the Catholic Church does are very old. \n\nThey do the same things for a long time. \n\nThis is good. Tradition helps keep us strong. \n\nBut we also need to change with the times. \n\nMany Catholics go to Church every week. \n\nThe Church is strict about rules. \n\nSometimes I think the Church looks down on people who do not follow all the rules. \n\nThe Church does not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \n\nIt also does not accept people from other religions. \n\nFor example, my mom was from a different Christian group and my dad was from another one. \n\nThey could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \n\nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. \n\nCatholics are taught to love others. \n\nBut it is not fair to say we love others and then not accept them. \n\nSo, I think some Catholic teachings and practices do not match. \n\nThe Church is slow to change. \n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop them from hurting children. \n\nSome people who hurt children will do so no matter what. \n\nIt is not fair to compare a spouse to a child. \n\nThese things will probably happen anyway. \n\nTherefore, I do not think allowing priests to marry would be a solution.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I don't know if one side is right or wrong. This is a very difficult problem we face now. It is hard to solve without hurting anyone's feelings. \n\nMarriage and church are two things that are very close together. But we cannot define marriage without offending people. It's hard to decide what marriage is. Should the government decide how to look at marriage? Some people think marriage is a special thing, like a sacrament. If you are married, you get special tax breaks. But if you were baptized, you still get the same tax breaks. \n\nSo, if two people are married, the government should look at it as just a civil union. It's two people who are together. The government should not look at what kind of marriage it was. \n\nGay marriage is another problem. Two people who love each other should be able to have a civil union. \n\nIf all states can agree on this, they should make it a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution is very important. We should not change it for a small issue. \n\nSome people are very passionate about this issue. But it's not big enough to change the constitution. We should not change the constitution to ban gay marriage. \n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes me think about homosexuality in a complex way. I have many gay friends. I don't agree with their lifestyle, but I think it should be legal. I don't think it's a national issue. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are republican. Democratic states usually support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how they feel about this issue. I think you should respect their decision if they choose to legalize gay marriage. You chose to live there, so you should accept their laws.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. This is why I think each state should be able to decide about gay marriage. I already said this, but I want to say it again. I don't think the president should decide for the whole country. President Bush is against gay marriage, but he can't decide for all states. This is because he doesn't live in every state.\n\nI think some things should be decided by each state. If a president changes the law, it will just change back when another president is elected. The states will have to live with their decisions, not the president. If a president lifts the ban on gay marriage in some states, it will not be the same in other states.\n\nI don't agree with President Bush's decision. I think each state should be able to make its own choice about gay marriage.",
            "Myspace is a public place on the Internet. If you put something on it, everyone can see it. This includes school officials. You can't hide it even if you don't use your school name.\n\nWhen you post on the Internet, people will see it. This includes school officials. They can see it from their homes. They may see things that students are not supposed to do. If they see something that can prevent a school shooting, they can take action.\n\nI think school officials can see what students are doing on Myspace. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is their responsibility. They want to make the school a safe place.\n\nSchools have rules to protect students. They practice lock downs in case of emergency. This helps them be prepared for bad things that can happen.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to make sure students are safe. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is good for everyone.\n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy if they look at Myspace to keep students safe. If they see something bad, they can take action. This is their job.\n\nWhen you write something, it can come back to you. This is why you should be careful what you say. If you say something bad, it can hurt you.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to make sure students are not doing bad things. If they see something, they can help. This is good for everyone.\n\nIn my opinion, school officials can look at Myspace to make the school a safer place. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is their job.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I wanted to help. I was affected by the 9/11 attacks. I thought we should go to their country and stop the bad things they did to us.\n\nHowever, I think we did not think about the long-term effects. We did not prepare well and did not have a good plan. This may have led to problems.\n\nNow, I am against the war. I do not think it helped. When countries fight each other, they cannot attack us. If they cannot work together, we cannot change them.\n\nI do not care about what happens in their country. They fight a lot and cannot work together. This makes it hard for us to help them.\n\nWar is different in their country than in ours. They fight in a way that is not civilized. I do not think they want to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were not thinking clearly. We were looking for revenge, not for a good reason. President Bush wanted to declare war on Iraq. I understand why, but we did not have a good plan.\n\nI think we should have helped them in a better way. We did not have unity and did not know what we were doing. A clear plan would have been helpful.\n\nI do not think we can change their country. They will always be like that. We are not making enough progress. We have made some progress, but not enough to stay. If we leave, their country will probably collapse.\n\nWe are hurting ourselves by staying in their country. We cannot stay there forever. I think we should leave and let them solve their own problems."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

Some people do not want to be part of a church that does not agree with their ideas. The Catholic Church is against abortion. If you support abortion, you may not want to be part of a church that says it is wrong.\n\nThe same is true for gay marriage and other issues. If you disagree with the Catholic Church's views, you may not want to be part of the church. The Catholic Church does not allow women to be priests or for priests to be married.

            "I think gay marriage should be legal. \n\nThere is no good reason it should not be. \n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. \n\nIt's different. Similar to how two sides of a coin are different but equal. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. Like paying taxes and getting health care. \n\nBut now, if you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or make decisions for you. \n\nThis is not fair. Many studies show that gay couples have the same rates of success as straight couples. They have the same things that make a happy relationship. \n\nIt's just a relationship. The same as any other. \n\nThe problem is that people get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. But gay couples are only asking for a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government allows a civil union, why not a marriage? \n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. \n\nGay couples are the same in many ways. They have the same roles in a relationship. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and how it will affect the community. \n\nThey also worry about children of gay couples. Will they be treated unfairly by their peers and other adults? \n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they get bullied in regular schools. \n\nParents protest to take the child out of school. \n\nThis is not fair to the child. Parenting skills are the same for gay and straight couples. \n\nThe government should help make gay marriage legal in all states. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, based on his religion. But morality is different for everyone. \n\nThe government should not make laws based on one group's morality. It's not fair to ignore the culture and morality of others. \n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they believe being gay is a choice or a defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. \n\nWe should listen to experts, not just what our friends and neighbors say.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. I know some people think that because a drug is against the law, it cannot be good.

I do not think it should be available to everyone.\n\nBut, if a doctor says it can help someone, I think it should be used. Just because a drug is against the law does not mean it is bad. Many medicines are against the law, but doctors use them to help people. \n\nFor example, oxycodone and Vicodin are against the law, but they are used in pharmacies because they are helpful. If people think marijuana is bad just because it is against the law, it is not fair. We should think about its good properties.\n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If people drink too much alcohol, it can be bad for them. But if people use marijuana too much, it is not as bad. Maybe we should make marijuana legal, but not all at once. We should help people understand that it is not a bad thing.\n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine.

            "I think the church has changed to fit modern times. It is not as strict as it was in the past. When I was a child, I went to church every Sunday. I wore a new dress and matching shoes and handbag. It was a special part of my life. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nThe church now has a shorter service on Sundays, only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes and sometimes arrive late. This makes the church feel more relaxed.\n\nI also notice that people wear jeans and khaki pants to morning services. It's a big change from when I wore dresses and skirts. But it's not all bad – khaki pants are nice too.\n\nI don't know much about the church's rules and politics. But I think the church has become more casual.\n\nRegarding the problem of Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't think changing rules would have stopped it. Some men become pedophiles because of their genetics, not because of their choices. Even married men can become pedophiles. It's not because they are allowed to get married or not.\n\nSome religions allow their priests to get married, like Seventh-day Adventists. But even in those cases, some men still become pedophiles. I think it's the person's choice, not their faith, that makes them a pedophile.\n\nI think genetics play a big role in making people become pedophiles. It's not something they choose or learn. It's who they are. You can't change someone's genetics, even with a marriage.\n\nIf the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, that's wrong. But I don't think they always knew. If they did, they should have acted.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic church.",
            "The Iraq war is a very serious issue. I was not happy with the reason we went to war. The 9/11 attacks happened in September. Many people were still upset. I think the Bush administration used the Iraq war as an excuse. They said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but this was not true.\n\nI think the Bush administration lied to the American people.

It is against the law for a president to lie to the people.\n\nI think the Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution. They have tried to make it weaker since 9/11.

He said the younger Bush wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein because his father was mad at him.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If we leave now, many more people will die. The country may fall into civil war. The UN and the US are trying to find a new way. They want other countries in the area to help restore order. But I am not sure this is a good idea. Iraq will have trouble being a free country if other countries control it.\n\nThe government in Iraq is not working well. The Parliament is not effective. The Prime Minister does not have control.

The person in charge, President Bush, is looking bad because of the war. It is like the Vietnam War, which was also not declared as a war and was not successful.\n\nI know people who have family members in Iraq. Some of these family members are fighting in the war.

            "I don't think it's right for a state to make a law about something that is against a church's rules. The constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control what churches do.

It would be like the government saying, \"We don't like your church's rules, so we will make a new law to stop you.\"\n\nSome people want to make a law against this, but I think that's not fair.

If the government makes a law about this, it would be wrong. It would be against what is already written in the constitution.\n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this issue. The president is trying to make a law because of his own personal beliefs. He is showing that he prefers one religion over others. This is not fair.\n\nThere is no good reason for a law against this.

            "The war in Iraq was a difficult and complicated issue. I think the US government was not honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, I believe the government tried to connect the war in Iraq to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. However, this connection was not clear.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq was similar to the Vietnam War. The US government did not learn from past mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government, but the government was not prepared for the consequences. \n\nThe aftermath of the war was chaotic and violent. The US tried to put a democratic government in Iraq, but this was not an easy task. It took years to implement a new form of government. In the US, it took a long time to establish a strong democracy.\n\nThe US government should have been more careful and prepared before invading Iraq. They should have thought about all possible outcomes. The government was not honest with the American people about the war. They made the war seem like a quick and easy victory.\n\nThe US government should not have gone to war without a clear plan. Many American troops are still dying in Iraq. The US is trying to train the Iraqi military and police to control their country. This is a long and difficult process.\n\nThe government made it seem like the war would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. However, this was not true. Implementing a new form of government takes a long time. It was not an easy thing to do in the US, and it will not be easy in Iraq.\n\nThe war in Iraq was a difficult decision. I had mixed feelings about it. In the 2004 presidential election, one of my reasons for voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, I now think that the US should try to leave Iraq, but it is hard because the US took away their government and way of life.\n\nThe US should consider the many American casualties and whether it is worth risking more lives for a free democratic Iraq. If we are invading Iraq to make it a democracy, why not help other countries? The main reason is oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. Another reason for the war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there will be peace.

            "I support gay marriage. I have always supported it. It is a personal preference. Some people think it may be caused by biology, not by how we are raised. This means we should not give people fewer rights because of something they cannot control.\n\nI think it is wrong to deny people rights because of their personal life. People who love each other should be able to get married. This is not just a state or government issue, it is a personal issue.\n\nIn my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed to be. But they live like any other family. They walk their dogs like everyone else. I think it is not right for the government to decide what marriage is.\n\nResearch shows that being gay may be caused by something in the brain. People may be born this way. It is not because of how they are raised or their family.\n\nMarriage is a personal thing. If two people want to get married, they should be able to do it quietly, like anyone else. But if gay people want to get married, it becomes a big issue. This is not right. Marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.\n\nI do not think the government should decide who can get married and who cannot. This is a personal choice.",

The school looked at the student's Facebook page and found some things that were not good. They looked serious because of the situation.\n\nWhen you put something on the internet, you cannot control who sees it. If you do not want people to know something, do not post it online. You cannot tell people what to think or what to take seriously.\n\nSchool officials should not friend students on the internet. However, if a student tells them something, they must take it seriously. But they should not be monitoring students' phone conversations or texts. If something is brought to their attention, it is a different situation.\n\nAs a resident assistant, I do not friend my residents on the internet. I do not want to know about their private lives. I do not want to have to deal with their problems.",
            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe original goal was good - to bring democracy to a country without a fair government. \nBut we have lost sight of this goal. \nNow, it seems we are fighting just to show our power. \n\nThe reasons for the war were questionable from the start. \nGeorge Bush's father had disagreements with Saddam Hussein in the past. \nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country ruled by a dictator, that would be a fair reason for war. \nBut personal reasons would not be fair. \n\nI think we made our point in the first few months of the war. \nStarting the war was a strong statement. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nThis is too long.\n\nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a good reason for war. \nBut our reasons have changed over time. \nNow, it seems we are fighting just to fight. \nWe do not want to end the war without winning. \n\nThe war has lasted too long. \nTheir government should take care of itself now. \nWe have spent billions of dollars on this war. \nWe have our own problems, like poverty and bad roads. \nWe should spend our money on these problems. \n\nWe are spending too much money on the war. \nWe should use this money for things like health care and schools. \nMany of our citizens are dying in this war. \nWe are losing the reason for fighting. \n\nI think that is my opinion.",
            "I have a question. I was thinking about the fact that someone went online and saw something. This made a bad thing not happen. The person was on a website called Myspace. If you put information on the internet, it can be seen by many people. On Myspace, you need a friend to see someone's profile. But when you make someone a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information. So, if you put information on the internet, you should expect that many people will see it.\n\nThis is a difficult problem. If someone is watching students' profiles to prevent bad things, it's not fair to just look at certain students. But if someone sees something bad by chance, it's good that they can stop it. It depends on why they were looking at the profile.\n\nI have a Facebook account, but not a Myspace one. I know there are bad people who can see things about me. I saw a story on TV about a man who got information easily from someone's profile. He contacted her on instant messenger and she met him. I would not do that. Some people in my classes know me without knowing my name on the internet. They can find out where I am and who my friends are. It's hard to keep my personal things private.\n\nI limit what I put on the internet, but I also want to communicate with friends. I only accept friends I know. But I'm not sure who can see what.\n\nMy roommate told me about a school that banned Myspace. I don't know if this is a privacy issue. I don't know if the school had the right to tell students they couldn't have Myspace. That's my only other thought.",
            "The Iraq War is a big problem. I want to talk about it. I feel strange saying I was against it from the start. Many people agree it was a bad idea. Most people in the United States, Iraq, and the world think so. \n\nAccording to polls, about 75 to 80 percent of people think the war was a bad idea. In Iraq, 80 percent of people agree. Even 70 percent of US troops in Iraq think it was a mistake. They think the US should leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq is very bad. It was a problem before the US entered. Now, pulling out of Iraq will be difficult too. There is a big cultural difference between the US and countries in the Middle East. The US thinks it can bring democracy to these countries. However, this is not what the people want. Saddam was a bad leader, but you must think carefully before invading a country.\n\nI do not see a good reason for staying in Iraq. I have not heard a good reason to stay longer. If the US wants to leave slowly over time, I would not be against it. But I do not see a reason to stay.\n\nI read that 80 percent of Iraqis want the US to leave within a year. Some Iraqis even want the US to leave now. These are the people we want to help. Maybe they know what is best for them. If we ask them and they say they want us to leave, then we cannot blame them if things get worse.\n\nIf we leave, we can say we tried to help. If we decide to help them after that, we will be seen as good people. Not really, but it will be better than now.",
            "Gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It is not just for women. It also happens in the workplace. The field of work can make a difference. For example, in some jobs, people might think it is hard for a woman to be in charge. This is because society has a long history. In the past, women did not usually hold important positions.\n\nIn many places, people think it is strange for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. This is not always true. Some men want to be at home with their children. But society does not always accept this. People might think, \"Men should work and earn money for their families.\" This can be hard for men who choose to stay at home.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men may not be taken seriously if they like fashion. Some people think men who like fashion are not typical. They might think, \"How can a man know about fashion for women?\" This is a problem because it is not true. Men can know a lot about fashion.\n\nChange is slow. It takes time. But things are getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and getting important jobs. People are starting to accept this. It is also becoming more accepted for men to stay at home and take care of their children. \n\nWe need to promote the qualities of people who are often discriminated against. We should show their good qualities without being too pushy. If we force people to accept change, they might resist. We have made progress, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can be discriminated against based on their job, where they are from, or their gender. For example, someone from a farm might not have good grammar, but they might be very intelligent. They might work their way up to a CEO position. However, other men might think, \"How can I know if you are smart if you don't speak well?\"\n\nIn short, gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It affects women and men in different ways. It also affects people based on their job and where they are from.",
            "My understanding is that they did not make marijuana a crime.  Instead, they made it a minor offense.  You can get a ticket for it, but you will not be arrested.  This is a change from the past when it was a serious crime.\n\nSome people worry about the future problems that come with a marijuana charge, even if it is not a crime.  But there are two sides to this issue.  One side is that it costs a lot of money to arrest and try people for marijuana offenses.  This money could be used for other important things like education and helping the poor.\n\nIn some cities, people are against making marijuana legal because they do not want it to be easily available.  But in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded.  They think making marijuana legal is a good idea because it can bring in money for important programs.\n\nHowever, if marijuana were totally legal, it could be sold in stores like cigarettes.  This might lead to people smoking and driving, which is a problem.  Some people also think it would be uncomfortable to have marijuana out in the open.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol can cause problems.  Marijuana can affect people's lifestyles, and alcohol can affect their driving and decision-making.  Everyone reacts differently to substances, and some people have trouble controlling themselves.\n\nI think it is hard to say what the effects of marijuana will be because people react differently.  But I do think that both marijuana and alcohol have their own problems.",
            "I agree. \n\nBecause I think some things the Catholic Church does are very old. \n\nThey do the same things for a long time. \n\nThis is good. Tradition helps keep us strong. \n\nBut we also need to change with the times. \n\nMany Catholics go to Church every week. \n\nThe Church is strict about rules. \n\nSometimes I think the Church looks down on people who do not follow all the rules. \n\nThe Church does not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \n\nIt also does not accept people from other religions. \n\nFor example, my mom was from a different Christian group and my dad was from another one. \n\nThey could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \n\nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. \n\nCatholics are taught to love others. \n\nBut it is not fair to say we love others and then not accept them. \n\nSo, I think some Catholic teachings and practices do not match. \n\nThe Church is slow to change. \n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop them from hurting children. \n\nSome people who hurt children will do so no matter what. \n\nIt is not fair to compare a spouse to a child. \n\nThese things will probably happen anyway. \n\nTherefore, I do not think allowing priests to marry would be a solution.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I don't know if one side is right or wrong. This is a very difficult problem we face now. It is hard to solve without hurting anyone's feelings. \n\nMarriage and church are two things that are very close together. But we cannot define marriage without offending people. It's hard to decide what marriage is. Should the government decide how to look at marriage? Some people think marriage is a special thing, like a sacrament. If you are married, you get special tax breaks. But if you were baptized, you still get the same tax breaks. \n\nSo, if two people are married, the government should look at it as just a civil union. It's two people who are together. The government should not look at what kind of marriage it was. \n\nGay marriage is another problem. Two people who love each other should be able to have a civil union. \n\nIf all states can agree on this, they should make it a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution is very important. We should not change it for a small issue. \n\nSome people are very passionate about this issue. But it's not big enough to change the constitution. We should not change the constitution to ban gay marriage. \n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes me think about homosexuality in a complex way. I have many gay friends. I don't agree with their lifestyle, but I think it should be legal. I don't think it's a national issue. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are republican. Democratic states usually support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how they feel about this issue. I think you should respect their decision if they choose to legalize gay marriage. You chose to live there, so you should accept their laws.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. This is why I think each state should be able to decide about gay marriage. I already said this, but I want to say it again. I don't think the president should decide for the whole country. President Bush is against gay marriage, but he can't decide for all states. This is because he doesn't live in every state.\n\nI think some things should be decided by each state. If a president changes the law, it will just change back when another president is elected. The states will have to live with their decisions, not the president. If a president lifts the ban on gay marriage in some states, it will not be the same in other states.\n\nI don't agree with President Bush's decision. I think each state should be able to make its own choice about gay marriage.",
            "Myspace is a public place on the Internet. If you put something on it, everyone can see it. This includes school officials. You can't hide it even if you don't use your school name.\n\nWhen you post on the Internet, people will see it. This includes school officials. They can see it from their homes. They may see things that students are not supposed to do. If they see something that can prevent a school shooting, they can take action.\n\nI think school officials can see what students are doing on Myspace. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is their responsibility. They want to make the school a safe place.\n\nSchools have rules to protect students. They practice lock downs in case of emergency. This helps them be prepared for bad things that can happen.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to make sure students are safe. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is good for everyone.\n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy if they look at Myspace to keep students safe. If they see something bad, they can take action. This is their job.\n\nWhen you write something, it can come back to you. This is why you should be careful what you say. If you say something bad, it can hurt you.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to make sure students are not doing bad things. If they see something, they can help. This is good for everyone.\n\nIn my opinion, school officials can look at Myspace to make the school a safer place. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is their job.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I wanted to help. I was affected by the 9/11 attacks. I thought we should go to their country and stop the bad things they did to us.\n\nHowever, I think we did not think about the long-term effects. We did not prepare well and did not have a good plan. This may have led to problems.\n\nNow, I am against the war. I do not think it helped. When countries fight each other, they cannot attack us. If they cannot work together, we cannot change them.\n\nI do not care about what happens in their country. They fight a lot and cannot work together. This makes it hard for us to help them.\n\nWar is different in their country than in ours. They fight in a way that is not civilized. I do not think they want to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were not thinking clearly. We were looking for revenge, not for a good reason. President Bush wanted to declare war on Iraq. I understand why, but we did not have a good plan.\n\nI think we should have helped them in a better way. We did not have unity and did not know what we were doing. A clear plan would have been helpful.\n\nI do not think we can change their country. They will always be like that. We are not making enough progress. We have made some progress, but not enough to stay. If we leave, their country will probably collapse.\n\nWe are hurting ourselves by staying in their country. We cannot stay there forever. I think we should leave and let them solve their own problems."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

Some people do not want to be part of a church that does not agree with their ideas. The Catholic Church is against abortion. If you support abortion, you may not want to be part of a church that says it is wrong.\n\nThe same is true for gay marriage and other issues. If you disagree with the Catholic Church's views, you may not want to be part of the church. The Catholic Church does not allow women to be priests or for priests to be married.

            "I think gay marriage should be legal. \n\nThere is no good reason it should not be. \n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. \n\nIt's different. Similar to how two sides of a coin are different but equal. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. Like paying taxes and getting health care. \n\nBut now, if you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or make decisions for you. \n\nThis is not fair. Many studies show that gay couples have the same rates of success as straight couples. They have the same things that make a happy relationship. \n\nIt's just a relationship. The same as any other. \n\nThe problem is that people get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. But gay couples are only asking for a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government allows a civil union, why not a marriage? \n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. \n\nGay couples are the same in many ways. They have the same roles in a relationship. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and how it will affect the community. \n\nThey also worry about children of gay couples. Will they be treated unfairly by their peers and other adults? \n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they get bullied in regular schools. \n\nParents protest to take the child out of school. \n\nThis is not fair to the child. Parenting skills are the same for gay and straight couples. \n\nThe government should help make gay marriage legal in all states. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, based on his religion. But morality is different for everyone. \n\nThe government should not make laws based on one group's morality. It's not fair to ignore the culture and morality of others. \n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they believe being gay is a choice or a defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. \n\nWe should listen to experts, not just what our friends and neighbors say.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. I know some people think that because a drug is against the law, it cannot be good.

I do not think it should be available to everyone.\n\nBut, if a doctor says it can help someone, I think it should be used. Just because a drug is against the law does not mean it is bad. Many medicines are against the law, but doctors use them to help people. \n\nFor example, oxycodone and Vicodin are against the law, but they are used in pharmacies because they are helpful. If people think marijuana is bad just because it is against the law, it is not fair. We should think about its good properties.\n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If people drink too much alcohol, it can be bad for them. But if people use marijuana too much, it is not as bad. Maybe we should make marijuana legal, but not all at once. We should help people understand that it is not a bad thing.\n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine.

            "I think the church has changed to fit modern times. It is not as strict as it was in the past. When I was a child, I went to church every Sunday. I wore a new dress and matching shoes and handbag. It was a special part of my life. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nThe church now has a shorter service on Sundays, only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes and sometimes arrive late. This makes the church feel more relaxed.\n\nI also notice that people wear jeans and khaki pants to morning services. It's a big change from when I wore dresses and skirts. But it's not all bad – khaki pants are nice too.\n\nI don't know much about the church's rules and politics. But I think the church has become more casual.\n\nRegarding the problem of Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't think changing rules would have stopped it. Some men become pedophiles because of their genetics, not because of their choices. Even married men can become pedophiles. It's not because they are allowed to get married or not.\n\nSome religions allow their priests to get married, like Seventh-day Adventists. But even in those cases, some men still become pedophiles. I think it's the person's choice, not their faith, that makes them a pedophile.\n\nI think genetics play a big role in making people become pedophiles. It's not something they choose or learn. It's who they are. You can't change someone's genetics, even with a marriage.\n\nIf the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, that's wrong. But I don't think they always knew. If they did, they should have acted.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic church.",
            "The Iraq war is a very serious issue. I was not happy with the reason we went to war. The 9/11 attacks happened in September. Many people were still upset. I think the Bush administration used the Iraq war as an excuse. They said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but this was not true.\n\nI think the Bush administration lied to the American people.

It is against the law for a president to lie to the people.\n\nI think the Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution. They have tried to make it weaker since 9/11.

He said the younger Bush wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein because his father was mad at him.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If we leave now, many more people will die. The country may fall into civil war. The UN and the US are trying to find a new way. They want other countries in the area to help restore order. But I am not sure this is a good idea. Iraq will have trouble being a free country if other countries control it.\n\nThe government in Iraq is not working well. The Parliament is not effective. The Prime Minister does not have control.

The person in charge, President Bush, is looking bad because of the war. It is like the Vietnam War, which was also not declared as a war and was not successful.\n\nI know people who have family members in Iraq. Some of these family members are fighting in the war.

            "I don't think it's right for a state to make a law about something that is against a church's rules. The constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control what churches do.

It would be like the government saying, \"We don't like your church's rules, so we will make a new law to stop you.\"\n\nSome people want to make a law against this, but I think that's not fair.

If the government makes a law about this, it would be wrong. It would be against what is already written in the constitution.\n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this issue. The president is trying to make a law because of his own personal beliefs. He is showing that he prefers one religion over others. This is not fair.\n\nThere is no good reason for a law against this.

            "The war in Iraq was a difficult and complicated issue. I think the US government was not honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, I believe the government tried to connect the war in Iraq to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. However, this connection was not clear.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq was similar to the Vietnam War. The US government did not learn from past mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government, but the government was not prepared for the consequences. \n\nThe aftermath of the war was chaotic and violent. The US tried to put a democratic government in Iraq, but this was not an easy task. It took years to implement a new form of government. In the US, it took a long time to establish a strong democracy.\n\nThe US government should have been more careful and prepared before invading Iraq. They should have thought about all possible outcomes. The government was not honest with the American people about the war. They made the war seem like a quick and easy victory.\n\nThe US government should not have gone to war without a clear plan. Many American troops are still dying in Iraq. The US is trying to train the Iraqi military and police to control their country. This is a long and difficult process.\n\nThe government made it seem like the war would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. However, this was not true. Implementing a new form of government takes a long time. It was not an easy thing to do in the US, and it will not be easy in Iraq.\n\nThe war in Iraq was a difficult decision. I had mixed feelings about it. In the 2004 presidential election, one of my reasons for voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, I now think that the US should try to leave Iraq, but it is hard because the US took away their government and way of life.\n\nThe US should consider the many American casualties and whether it is worth risking more lives for a free democratic Iraq. If we are invading Iraq to make it a democracy, why not help other countries? The main reason is oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. Another reason for the war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there will be peace.

            "I support gay marriage. I have always supported it. It is a personal preference. Some people think it may be caused by biology, not by how we are raised. This means we should not give people fewer rights because of something they cannot control.\n\nI think it is wrong to deny people rights because of their personal life. People who love each other should be able to get married. This is not just a state or government issue, it is a personal issue.\n\nIn my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed to be. But they live like any other family. They walk their dogs like everyone else. I think it is not right for the government to decide what marriage is.\n\nResearch shows that being gay may be caused by something in the brain. People may be born this way. It is not because of how they are raised or their family.\n\nMarriage is a personal thing. If two people want to get married, they should be able to do it quietly, like anyone else. But if gay people want to get married, it becomes a big issue. This is not right. Marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.\n\nI do not think the government should decide who can get married and who cannot. This is a personal choice.",

The school looked at the student's Facebook page and found some things that were not good. They looked serious because of the situation.\n\nWhen you put something on the internet, you cannot control who sees it. If you do not want people to know something, do not post it online. You cannot tell people what to think or what to take seriously.\n\nSchool officials should not friend students on the internet. However, if a student tells them something, they must take it seriously. But they should not be monitoring students' phone conversations or texts. If something is brought to their attention, it is a different situation.\n\nAs a resident assistant, I do not friend my residents on the internet. I do not want to know about their private lives. I do not want to have to deal with their problems.",
            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe original goal was good - to bring democracy to a country without a fair government. \nBut we have lost sight of this goal. \nNow, it seems we are fighting just to show our power. \n\nThe reasons for the war were questionable from the start. \nGeorge Bush's father had disagreements with Saddam Hussein in the past. \nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country ruled by a dictator, that would be a fair reason for war. \nBut personal reasons would not be fair. \n\nI think we made our point in the first few months of the war. \nStarting the war was a strong statement. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nThis is too long.\n\nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a good reason for war. \nBut our reasons have changed over time. \nNow, it seems we are fighting just to fight. \nWe do not want to end the war without winning. \n\nThe war has lasted too long. \nTheir government should take care of itself now. \nWe have spent billions of dollars on this war. \nWe have our own problems, like poverty and bad roads. \nWe should spend our money on these problems. \n\nWe are spending too much money on the war. \nWe should use this money for things like health care and schools. \nMany of our citizens are dying in this war. \nWe are losing the reason for fighting. \n\nI think that is my opinion.",
            "I have a question. I was thinking about the fact that someone went online and saw something. This made a bad thing not happen. The person was on a website called Myspace. If you put information on the internet, it can be seen by many people. On Myspace, you need a friend to see someone's profile. But when you make someone a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information. So, if you put information on the internet, you should expect that many people will see it.\n\nThis is a difficult problem. If someone is watching students' profiles to prevent bad things, it's not fair to just look at certain students. But if someone sees something bad by chance, it's good that they can stop it. It depends on why they were looking at the profile.\n\nI have a Facebook account, but not a Myspace one. I know there are bad people who can see things about me. I saw a story on TV about a man who got information easily from someone's profile. He contacted her on instant messenger and she met him. I would not do that. Some people in my classes know me without knowing my name on the internet. They can find out where I am and who my friends are. It's hard to keep my personal things private.\n\nI limit what I put on the internet, but I also want to communicate with friends. I only accept friends I know. But I'm not sure who can see what.\n\nMy roommate told me about a school that banned Myspace. I don't know if this is a privacy issue. I don't know if the school had the right to tell students they couldn't have Myspace. That's my only other thought.",
            "The Iraq War is a big problem. I want to talk about it. I feel strange saying I was against it from the start. Many people agree it was a bad idea. Most people in the United States, Iraq, and the world think so. \n\nAccording to polls, about 75 to 80 percent of people think the war was a bad idea. In Iraq, 80 percent of people agree. Even 70 percent of US troops in Iraq think it was a mistake. They think the US should leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq is very bad. It was a problem before the US entered. Now, pulling out of Iraq will be difficult too. There is a big cultural difference between the US and countries in the Middle East. The US thinks it can bring democracy to these countries. However, this is not what the people want. Saddam was a bad leader, but you must think carefully before invading a country.\n\nI do not see a good reason for staying in Iraq. I have not heard a good reason to stay longer. If the US wants to leave slowly over time, I would not be against it. But I do not see a reason to stay.\n\nI read that 80 percent of Iraqis want the US to leave within a year. Some Iraqis even want the US to leave now. These are the people we want to help. Maybe they know what is best for them. If we ask them and they say they want us to leave, then we cannot blame them if things get worse.\n\nIf we leave, we can say we tried to help. If we decide to help them after that, we will be seen as good people. Not really, but it will be better than now.",
            "Gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It is not just for women. It also happens in the workplace. The field of work can make a difference. For example, in some jobs, people might think it is hard for a woman to be in charge. This is because society has a long history. In the past, women did not usually hold important positions.\n\nIn many places, people think it is strange for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. This is not always true. Some men want to be at home with their children. But society does not always accept this. People might think, \"Men should work and earn money for their families.\" This can be hard for men who choose to stay at home.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men may not be taken seriously if they like fashion. Some people think men who like fashion are not typical. They might think, \"How can a man know about fashion for women?\" This is a problem because it is not true. Men can know a lot about fashion.\n\nChange is slow. It takes time. But things are getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and getting important jobs. People are starting to accept this. It is also becoming more accepted for men to stay at home and take care of their children. \n\nWe need to promote the qualities of people who are often discriminated against. We should show their good qualities without being too pushy. If we force people to accept change, they might resist. We have made progress, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can be discriminated against based on their job, where they are from, or their gender. For example, someone from a farm might not have good grammar, but they might be very intelligent. They might work their way up to a CEO position. However, other men might think, \"How can I know if you are smart if you don't speak well?\"\n\nIn short, gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It affects women and men in different ways. It also affects people based on their job and where they are from.",
            "My understanding is that they did not make marijuana a crime.  Instead, they made it a minor offense.  You can get a ticket for it, but you will not be arrested.  This is a change from the past when it was a serious crime.\n\nSome people worry about the future problems that come with a marijuana charge, even if it is not a crime.  But there are two sides to this issue.  One side is that it costs a lot of money to arrest and try people for marijuana offenses.  This money could be used for other important things like education and helping the poor.\n\nIn some cities, people are against making marijuana legal because they do not want it to be easily available.  But in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded.  They think making marijuana legal is a good idea because it can bring in money for important programs.\n\nHowever, if marijuana were totally legal, it could be sold in stores like cigarettes.  This might lead to people smoking and driving, which is a problem.  Some people also think it would be uncomfortable to have marijuana out in the open.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol can cause problems.  Marijuana can affect people's lifestyles, and alcohol can affect their driving and decision-making.  Everyone reacts differently to substances, and some people have trouble controlling themselves.\n\nI think it is hard to say what the effects of marijuana will be because people react differently.  But I do think that both marijuana and alcohol have their own problems.",
            "I agree. \n\nBecause I think some things the Catholic Church does are very old. \n\nThey do the same things for a long time. \n\nThis is good. Tradition helps keep us strong. \n\nBut we also need to change with the times. \n\nMany Catholics go to Church every week. \n\nThe Church is strict about rules. \n\nSometimes I think the Church looks down on people who do not follow all the rules. \n\nThe Church does not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \n\nIt also does not accept people from other religions. \n\nFor example, my mom was from a different Christian group and my dad was from another one. \n\nThey could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \n\nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. \n\nCatholics are taught to love others. \n\nBut it is not fair to say we love others and then not accept them. \n\nSo, I think some Catholic teachings and practices do not match. \n\nThe Church is slow to change. \n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop them from hurting children. \n\nSome people who hurt children will do so no matter what. \n\nIt is not fair to compare a spouse to a child. \n\nThese things will probably happen anyway. \n\nTherefore, I do not think allowing priests to marry would be a solution.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I don't know if one side is right or wrong. This is a very difficult problem we face now. It is hard to solve without hurting anyone's feelings. \n\nMarriage and church are two things that are very close together. But we cannot define marriage without offending people. It's hard to decide what marriage is. Should the government decide how to look at marriage? Some people think marriage is a special thing, like a sacrament. If you are married, you get special tax breaks. But if you were baptized, you still get the same tax breaks. \n\nSo, if two people are married, the government should look at it as just a civil union. It's two people who are together. The government should not look at what kind of marriage it was. \n\nGay marriage is another problem. Two people who love each other should be able to have a civil union. \n\nIf all states can agree on this, they should make it a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution is very important. We should not change it for a small issue. \n\nSome people are very passionate about this issue. But it's not big enough to change the constitution. We should not change the constitution to ban gay marriage. \n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes me think about homosexuality in a complex way. I have many gay friends. I don't agree with their lifestyle, but I think it should be legal. I don't think it's a national issue. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are republican. Democratic states usually support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how they feel about this issue. I think you should respect their decision if they choose to legalize gay marriage. You chose to live there, so you should accept their laws.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. This is why I think each state should be able to decide about gay marriage. I already said this, but I want to say it again. I don't think the president should decide for the whole country. President Bush is against gay marriage, but he can't decide for all states. This is because he doesn't live in every state.\n\nI think some things should be decided by each state. If a president changes the law, it will just change back when another president is elected. The states will have to live with their decisions, not the president. If a president lifts the ban on gay marriage in some states, it will not be the same in other states.\n\nI don't agree with President Bush's decision. I think each state should be able to make its own choice about gay marriage.",
            "Myspace is a public place on the Internet. If you put something on it, everyone can see it. This includes school officials. You can't hide it even if you don't use your school name.\n\nWhen you post on the Internet, people will see it. This includes school officials. They can see it from their homes. They may see things that students are not supposed to do. If they see something that can prevent a school shooting, they can take action.\n\nI think school officials can see what students are doing on Myspace. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is their responsibility. They want to make the school a safe place.\n\nSchools have rules to protect students. They practice lock downs in case of emergency. This helps them be prepared for bad things that can happen.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to make sure students are safe. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is good for everyone.\n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy if they look at Myspace to keep students safe. If they see something bad, they can take action. This is their job.\n\nWhen you write something, it can come back to you. This is why you should be careful what you say. If you say something bad, it can hurt you.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to make sure students are not doing bad things. If they see something, they can help. This is good for everyone.\n\nIn my opinion, school officials can look at Myspace to make the school a safer place. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is their job.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I wanted to help. I was affected by the 9/11 attacks. I thought we should go to their country and stop the bad things they did to us.\n\nHowever, I think we did not think about the long-term effects. We did not prepare well and did not have a good plan. This may have led to problems.\n\nNow, I am against the war. I do not think it helped. When countries fight each other, they cannot attack us. If they cannot work together, we cannot change them.\n\nI do not care about what happens in their country. They fight a lot and cannot work together. This makes it hard for us to help them.\n\nWar is different in their country than in ours. They fight in a way that is not civilized. I do not think they want to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were not thinking clearly. We were looking for revenge, not for a good reason. President Bush wanted to declare war on Iraq. I understand why, but we did not have a good plan.\n\nI think we should have helped them in a better way. We did not have unity and did not know what we were doing. A clear plan would have been helpful.\n\nI do not think we can change their country. They will always be like that. We are not making enough progress. We have made some progress, but not enough to stay. If we leave, their country will probably collapse.\n\nWe are hurting ourselves by staying in their country. We cannot stay there forever. I think we should leave and let them solve their own problems."
