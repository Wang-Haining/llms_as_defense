            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. There is no good reason it should not be. Many people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. However, this is not true. Gay couples are the same as straight couples in many ways. They have the same kinds of relationships and responsibilities.\n\nOne problem with gay couples is that they are not allowed to visit their partners in the hospital. This is not fair. They are also not allowed to make medical decisions for each other. This is a civil rights issue. Gay couples should have the same rights as straight couples.\n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are successful and happy, just like straight couples. They have the same kinds of relationships and problems. They are not asking for the right to get married in a church. They just want a marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIf a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways. They have the same roles and responsibilities.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and children. But the main problem is how children are treated by their peers and other adults. In some places, like New York City, gay parents have to send their children to special schools because they are bullied in public schools.\n\nThis is not fair. Gay parents are just like straight parents. They love their children and want to take care of them. They should be treated with respect.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state. The government should not make laws based on one person's religion. This would be hypocritical.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or flawed. But this is not true. Many experts have studied this issue and say it is not true.\n\nWe should listen to experts and not just our friends or neighbors. We should look at the facts and treat everyone with respect.",

We wanted to help another country get democracy. \n\nBut then we lost sight of that goal. \nNow, some people think we are fighting just to show the world we are strong. \n\nI do not think that is a good reason to fight. \nThe problem started when we were still mad about what the previous president of the US did with Saddam Hussein. \n\nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country ruled by a dictator, that was a good reason to fight. \nBut our reason for fighting changed over time. \nNow, it seems like we are fighting just to keep fighting. \n\nWe don't want to end the war without winning, but it has been too long. \nThe country we are fighting in should be able to take care of itself now. \nWe are spending too much money on this war. \nWe have problems at home, like poverty and bad roads. \nWe should use that money to help our own people.\n\nOur money is being spent to fight a war we may not be winning. \nWe should use it for things like schools, roads and healthcare. \nThis is more important than spending it to fight in a foreign country.",
            "I have a question. I want to understand the situation.\n\nYou see, someone went online and found something. A person might not like this, but I think it is okay. If you put information on the internet, it is usually public. Many people can see it.\n\nFor example, on Myspace, you need to be friends with someone to see their profile. But if you are friends, you have given permission to see their information. So, when you are online, you must know that many people can see what you write.\n\nI think it is good that someone saw something and helped prevent trouble. But it is hard. We can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all day. That would be unfair. We can't pick on certain people and watch them closely. That is not fair.\n\nIt depends on why someone saw the profile. Were they looking for something specific or just browsing? I don't know.\n\nI have a Facebook account. It bothers me that there are people who can see my information. I know a man on TV who showed how easy it is to get information from someone's profile. He talked to a girl on instant messenger and got her screen name quickly.\n\nIt's hard because you think you are safe, but you are not. People can find out your interests, what you look like, and where you are. I try to limit what I put on my account, but I don't want to limit it too much. The point of having a Facebook is to communicate with friends.\n\nI only accept people I know, but I don't know who can see my information. My roommate told me about a school that banned students from having Myspace. I don't know if that is right. Can school officials tell students what to do on the internet?\n\nThat's my thought.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I know it's a sensitive topic. I was against the war from the start, but it's not a big deal now. Most people think it was a bad idea. \n\nIn the United States, in Iraq, and all over the world, most people think we made a mistake. In the United States, 75 to 80 percent of people think so. In Iraq, 80 percent of people think so. 70 percent of American soldiers in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea.\n\nLeaving Iraq will also be difficult. But it's already a disaster. We should not go into another country and try to make it like us. We must respect their way of life. \n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad man, but we should think before we go to war. We must think about the good and the bad. \n\nI don't think we should stay in Iraq anymore. We have not found a good reason to stay. If we leave slowly over a year or more, I don't have a problem. But I don't think we should stay any longer.\n\nMost Iraqis want us to leave. They think we should be gone in a year. They are the people we are trying to help. If they say leave, we should listen. If things go badly, we can say we did what they wanted.\n\nWe can be the good guys if we leave. We will never be fully accepted in the Middle East, but we will be better than we are now.",
            "I think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It is not only for women, but also for men in certain jobs.\n\nWomen often face more difficulties in many areas. This is because of a thing called the glass ceiling. It means even if there is supposed to be equality, it is hard for people to accept a woman as their boss. This is because of how society has been for a long time.\n\nIn many jobs, women can do all the work, but they may not get promoted because it is not common for women to be in charge. This is not only for women, but also for men in jobs like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.\n\nIn some societies, men are expected to work and make money, not stay home with the children. If a man stays home, people may think he is not doing the right thing. They may look down on him.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who like fashion may not be taken seriously if they are not like other men. People may think they do not know what fashion is for women. But this is changing.\n\nIt is slow to change, but women are getting more accepted in business and becoming CEOs. Men who stay home with their children are also becoming more accepted. People are starting to understand that women can have good jobs and men can stay home with the children.\n\nTo change this, we need to show the good qualities of people who are stereotyped. We should not push people to accept change, but show them the good things. If we do it too fast, people will resist. We have made good progress, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can be discriminated against because of where they are from or their job. For example, if someone from a farm goes to a big city and gets a job as a CEO, other people may not take him seriously because of his accent or grammar.\n\nHowever, this is not just between men and women. People from different places can also be discriminated against.",
            "My understanding is that some places don't make marijuana use a crime. Instead, they give a ticket to people who use it. This is like getting a traffic ticket. It means you don't get arrested and go to jail.\n\nThis change is good because it saves money. It costs a lot to arrest and take people to court. It costs money to pay for judges, public defenders, and the police. Some places are not willing to change the law, even if it would save them money. But some places, like Denver, are more open-minded.\n\nIn Denver, people can use marijuana and it's not a big problem. This means the city has more money to spend on good things, like education and programs to help the elderly and people who don't have food.\n\nPeople should think carefully about marijuana. It's not good for everyone to use it all the time. There are reasons why it's not good to use it in public. Some people might think it's not right to see people smoking marijuana in public.\n\nAlcohol can cause problems too. It can hurt your ability to drive and make decisions. Marijuana can also cause problems, but it's different for different people. Some people can use it and it doesn't affect them much. Others might have a harder time.\n\nIt's hard to say how people will react to marijuana because everyone is different. Some people can control how much they use, and some people can't. We should be careful when thinking about marijuana because it can have bad effects on people's lives.",
            "I think yes. \n\nBecause many things about the Catholic Church are old customs. \n\nThey do things in the same way for a long time. This is good because it helps keep traditions. \n\nBut it's also important to change. \n\nMany Catholics believe they must go to church every week. They are strict about how things are done. \n\nSometimes I think the Catholic Church does not respect people who do not follow all the rules. They do not like people from other religions. \n\nFor example, my mom was Episcopalian and my dad was too. They wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, but they could not because of my dad's religion. \n\nThis is not being kind to others. The Catholic Church teaches to love others. But it's not kind to not accept people who are different. \n\nI think some Catholic rules are good, but the way the Church acts is different. It's not fair to say one thing and do another. \n\nI do not think this would change how I feel. I think it would be good to allow priests to marry, but it might not stop them from behaving badly. \n\nPeople who hurt children might do this no matter if they are married or not. \n\nSo, I do not think allowing priests to marry would stop this from happening. It would still happen.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. \nI don't know if one side is right or wrong. \nThis is a very difficult problem. \nIt is between the church and the government. \nWe must define marriage without hurting anyone's feelings. \nI am not sure how to do this. \n\nAll civil unions are the same. \nBut the government may or may not give them the same rights. \nIf two people are married, they should be treated the same as anyone else. \nThis is a civil union, not a church thing. \n\nTwo people are together, that is all. \nThe government should not ask about the church. \nThe fact that some people are gay does not matter. \nThey are still two people in a union. \n\nIf all states agree, they should make it a federal law. \nMaking a rule in the constitution to stop gay marriage is not right. \nThis is not important enough to change the constitution. \nWe should not change the constitution just for one big issue. \n\nI don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. For me, homosexuality is a difficult issue. I have many gay friends. \n\nI do not agree with all aspects of their lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. It should not be a national problem. Each state should decide for itself. The president should not make a rule for the whole country.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are republican. Democratic states will likely support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you should respect its decision. You chose to live there.\n\nI think gay people should have the same rights as straight people. Each state should decide if it wants to allow gay marriage. It is a state's choice.\n\nI already said this. I do not think the president should decide for the whole country. George Bush should not decide how all states should be. Each state should decide for itself. He does not live in every state.\n\nSome things should be decided by each state. The president will leave office soon. If a new president wants to change the law, it will change back and forth. It is better if each state decides for itself. They will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not think the president should make this decision. It should be up to each state.",
            "When I think about Myspace, I remember it's a public website. If you post something there, everyone can see it. This includes school officials.\n\nIf you post something on the internet, you should think about who can see it.  School officials can look at Myspace, even if they're not looking for something under the school's name. They can see it from their homes.\n\nIn my opinion, school officials have the right to see things on the internet if it helps keep students safe. If they see something that prevents a school shooting, that's good.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing. But I think this is an invasion of privacy. However, if they help keep students safe, I don't think it's an invasion.\n\nIt's true that the internet is a public place. But the school should be a safe place. If school officials can make it safer, that's okay.\n\nWhen you post something on the internet, it's hard to control who sees it. If you write something bad about someone, you might regret it. The person could see it and it could hurt you.\n\nIn this case, the school officials were trying to keep students safe. They were checking the internet to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nSchool officials are like parents. When parents drop off their children at school, they want to know the school is a safe place. School officials have to make sure the school is safe.\n\nI was in a public high school, and we practiced lockdown drills in case of an attack. We wanted to be prepared. The school officials were trying to do the same thing. They were checking the internet to keep students safe.\n\nThey were preventing something bad from happening, like a school shooting. They were doing what was necessary to make the school a safer place.",
            "I was affected by the attack on 9/11. At first, I thought we should go to war. I wanted to help.\n\nBut I now think we made a mistake. We did not think about the long-term effects of our actions.\n\nWe did not plan carefully. We went to war without a clear goal. This led to problems.\n\nI do not think we helped the people in that area. They fight among themselves. They cannot work together.\n\nIf they cannot work together, it does not matter if we are there or not. Our presence did not make things better.\n\nI am sad about what happened on 9/11. But now I do not care about the situation in that area. They are not interested in helping themselves.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They fight in a way that is not civilized. Our goal was not to improve their country, but to get us out of there. I think that is a good idea.\n\nWe should have thought about what might happen before we went to war. We were angry and wanted revenge. We did not think about the future.\n\nThe President declared war on Iraq. I understand why he did it. But we should have had a clear plan.\n\nWe did not know what to do in that area. We did not have a clear goal. We did not have a plan to create order. This made things worse.\n\nI do not think we can change those people. They will always be the same. We are not doing enough to help them. We are only hurting ourselves by staying there.\n\nWe have made some progress, but it is not enough. It is time to leave. If we do not, things will only get worse. We cannot stay there forever."

you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. There is no good reason it should not be. Many people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. However, this is not true. Gay couples are the same as straight couples in many ways. They have the same kinds of relationships and responsibilities.\n\nOne problem with gay couples is that they are not allowed to visit their partners in the hospital. This is not fair. They are also not allowed to make medical decisions for each other. This is a civil rights issue. Gay couples should have the same rights as straight couples.\n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are successful and happy, just like straight couples. They have the same kinds of relationships and problems. They are not asking for the right to get married in a church. They just want a marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIf a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways. They have the same roles and responsibilities.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and children. But the main problem is how children are treated by their peers and other adults. In some places, like New York City, gay parents have to send their children to special schools because they are bullied in public schools.\n\nThis is not fair. Gay parents are just like straight parents. They love their children and want to take care of them. They should be treated with respect.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state. The government should not make laws based on one person's religion. This would be hypocritical.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or flawed. But this is not true. Many experts have studied this issue and say it is not true.\n\nWe should listen to experts and not just our friends or neighbors. We should look at the facts and treat everyone with respect.",

A drug can be bad or good for your health.\n\nI think there should not be a law that makes marijuana available to the public. But it can be used to help people who are sick. There is no reason to say no to its good effects.\n\nIn hospitals, we use some medicines that are illegal. They are called controlled substances. These medicines are useful and we use them every day. If we deny the good effects of marijuana because it is a taboo, that is not fair.\n\nMarijuana is not like alcohol. If you abuse marijuana, it can cause problems. But if you abuse alcohol, it also causes problems. It is a difficult decision.\n\nI think marijuana should not be made legal suddenly. It should be made legal in small steps. If it is made legal all at once, people might abuse it. But if we remove the bad image of marijuana, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad opinion of marijuana because it is illegal. But it is not as bad as other drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we change people's minds about marijuana, they might use it for medical reasons.",

People wear casual clothes, like jeans and t-shirts. Even on Sundays, people wear casual clothes. In the summer, people wear beach clothes. Some people are late to church.\n\nThe church is not as formal as it used to be. People dress more casually now. This is the main thing I noticed.\n\nI do not know the church's rules and politics.

I think the church could not have stopped these problems. Some men who are married still abuse children. It is not because they are married or not married. It is because of the person's choice.\n\nSome religions allow priests to be married. But it does not stop the abuse. The person's choice is to abuse or not to abuse.\n\nI think people are born with their sexuality. It is not because of how they are raised. Genetics are important. You cannot hide your genetics with a marriage. If you try to hide it, it will come out.\n\nThe church cannot stop people from abusing children. If they know about it and hide it, that is wrong.

I think the Bush administration lied to the American people and did not admit to it. Even Colin Powell later said he was not sure about the evidence. This is wrong and can be punished.\n\nI think the Bush administration does not respect the American Constitution. They have tried to change it since 9/11.

We must think about the good and the bad. \n\nI don't think we should stay in Iraq anymore. We have not found a good reason to stay. If we leave slowly over a year or more, I don't have a problem. But I don't think we should stay any longer.\n\nMost Iraqis want us to leave. They think we should be gone in a year. They are the people we are trying to help. If they say leave, we should listen. If things go badly, we can say we did what they wanted.\n\nWe can be the good guys if we leave. We will never be fully accepted in the Middle East, but we will be better than we are now.",
            "I think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It is not only for women, but also for men in certain jobs.\n\nWomen often face more difficulties in many areas. This is because of a thing called the glass ceiling. It means even if there is supposed to be equality, it is hard for people to accept a woman as their boss. This is because of how society has been for a long time.\n\nIn many jobs, women can do all the work, but they may not get promoted because it is not common for women to be in charge. This is not only for women, but also for men in jobs like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.\n\nIn some societies, men are expected to work and make money, not stay home with the children. If a man stays home, people may think he is not doing the right thing. They may look down on him.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who like fashion may not be taken seriously if they are not like other men. People may think they do not know what fashion is for women. But this is changing.\n\nIt is slow to change, but women are getting more accepted in business and becoming CEOs. Men who stay home with their children are also becoming more accepted. People are starting to understand that women can have good jobs and men can stay home with the children.\n\nTo change this, we need to show the good qualities of people who are stereotyped. We should not push people to accept change, but show them the good things. If we do it too fast, people will resist. We have made good progress, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can be discriminated against because of where they are from or their job. For example, if someone from a farm goes to a big city and gets a job as a CEO, other people may not take him seriously because of his accent or grammar.\n\nHowever, this is not just between men and women. People from different places can also be discriminated against.",
            "My understanding is that some places don't make marijuana use a crime. Instead, they give a ticket to people who use it. This is like getting a traffic ticket. It means you don't get arrested and go to jail.\n\nThis change is good because it saves money. It costs a lot to arrest and take people to court. It costs money to pay for judges, public defenders, and the police. Some places are not willing to change the law, even if it would save them money. But some places, like Denver, are more open-minded.\n\nIn Denver, people can use marijuana and it's not a big problem. This means the city has more money to spend on good things, like education and programs to help the elderly and people who don't have food.\n\nPeople should think carefully about marijuana. It's not good for everyone to use it all the time. There are reasons why it's not good to use it in public. Some people might think it's not right to see people smoking marijuana in public.\n\nAlcohol can cause problems too. It can hurt your ability to drive and make decisions. Marijuana can also cause problems, but it's different for different people. Some people can use it and it doesn't affect them much. Others might have a harder time.\n\nIt's hard to say how people will react to marijuana because everyone is different. Some people can control how much they use, and some people can't. We should be careful when thinking about marijuana because it can have bad effects on people's lives.",
            "I think yes. \n\nBecause many things about the Catholic Church are old customs. \n\nThey do things in the same way for a long time. This is good because it helps keep traditions. \n\nBut it's also important to change. \n\nMany Catholics believe they must go to church every week. They are strict about how things are done. \n\nSometimes I think the Catholic Church does not respect people who do not follow all the rules. They do not like people from other religions. \n\nFor example, my mom was Episcopalian and my dad was too. They wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, but they could not because of my dad's religion. \n\nThis is not being kind to others. The Catholic Church teaches to love others. But it's not kind to not accept people who are different. \n\nI think some Catholic rules are good, but the way the Church acts is different. It's not fair to say one thing and do another. \n\nI do not think this would change how I feel. I think it would be good to allow priests to marry, but it might not stop them from behaving badly. \n\nPeople who hurt children might do this no matter if they are married or not. \n\nSo, I do not think allowing priests to marry would stop this from happening. It would still happen.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. \nI don't know if one side is right or wrong. \nThis is a very difficult problem. \nIt is between the church and the government. \nWe must define marriage without hurting anyone's feelings. \nI am not sure how to do this. \n\nAll civil unions are the same. \nBut the government may or may not give them the same rights. \nIf two people are married, they should be treated the same as anyone else. \nThis is a civil union, not a church thing. \n\nTwo people are together, that is all. \nThe government should not ask about the church. \nThe fact that some people are gay does not matter. \nThey are still two people in a union. \n\nIf all states agree, they should make it a federal law. \nMaking a rule in the constitution to stop gay marriage is not right. \nThis is not important enough to change the constitution. \nWe should not change the constitution just for one big issue. \n\nI don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. For me, homosexuality is a difficult issue. I have many gay friends. \n\nI do not agree with all aspects of their lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. It should not be a national problem. Each state should decide for itself. The president should not make a rule for the whole country.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are republican. Democratic states will likely support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you should respect its decision. You chose to live there.\n\nI think gay people should have the same rights as straight people. Each state should decide if it wants to allow gay marriage. It is a state's choice.\n\nI already said this. I do not think the president should decide for the whole country. George Bush should not decide how all states should be. Each state should decide for itself. He does not live in every state.\n\nSome things should be decided by each state. The president will leave office soon. If a new president wants to change the law, it will change back and forth. It is better if each state decides for itself. They will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not think the president should make this decision. It should be up to each state.",
            "When I think about Myspace, I remember it's a public website. If you post something there, everyone can see it. This includes school officials.\n\nIf you post something on the internet, you should think about who can see it.  School officials can look at Myspace, even if they're not looking for something under the school's name. They can see it from their homes.\n\nIn my opinion, school officials have the right to see things on the internet if it helps keep students safe. If they see something that prevents a school shooting, that's good.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing. But I think this is an invasion of privacy. However, if they help keep students safe, I don't think it's an invasion.\n\nIt's true that the internet is a public place. But the school should be a safe place. If school officials can make it safer, that's okay.\n\nWhen you post something on the internet, it's hard to control who sees it. If you write something bad about someone, you might regret it. The person could see it and it could hurt you.\n\nIn this case, the school officials were trying to keep students safe. They were checking the internet to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nSchool officials are like parents. When parents drop off their children at school, they want to know the school is a safe place. School officials have to make sure the school is safe.\n\nI was in a public high school, and we practiced lockdown drills in case of an attack. We wanted to be prepared. The school officials were trying to do the same thing. They were checking the internet to keep students safe.\n\nThey were preventing something bad from happening, like a school shooting. They were doing what was necessary to make the school a safer place.",
            "I was affected by the attack on 9/11. At first, I thought we should go to war. I wanted to help.\n\nBut I now think we made a mistake. We did not think about the long-term effects of our actions.\n\nWe did not plan carefully. We went to war without a clear goal. This led to problems.\n\nI do not think we helped the people in that area. They fight among themselves. They cannot work together.\n\nIf they cannot work together, it does not matter if we are there or not. Our presence did not make things better.\n\nI am sad about what happened on 9/11. But now I do not care about the situation in that area. They are not interested in helping themselves.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They fight in a way that is not civilized. Our goal was not to improve their country, but to get us out of there. I think that is a good idea.\n\nWe should have thought about what might happen before we went to war. We were angry and wanted revenge. We did not think about the future.\n\nThe President declared war on Iraq. I understand why he did it. But we should have had a clear plan.\n\nWe did not know what to do in that area. We did not have a clear goal. We did not have a plan to create order. This made things worse.\n\nI do not think we can change those people. They will always be the same. We are not doing enough to help them. We are only hurting ourselves by staying there.\n\nWe have made some progress, but it is not enough. It is time to leave. If we do not, things will only get worse. We cannot stay there forever."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. There is no good reason it should not be. Many people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. However, this is not true. Gay couples are the same as straight couples in many ways. They have the same kinds of relationships and responsibilities.\n\nOne problem with gay couples is that they are not allowed to visit their partners in the hospital. This is not fair. They are also not allowed to make medical decisions for each other. This is a civil rights issue. Gay couples should have the same rights as straight couples.\n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are successful and happy, just like straight couples. They have the same kinds of relationships and problems. They are not asking for the right to get married in a church. They just want a marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIf a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways. They have the same roles and responsibilities.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and children. But the main problem is how children are treated by their peers and other adults. In some places, like New York City, gay parents have to send their children to special schools because they are bullied in public schools.\n\nThis is not fair. Gay parents are just like straight parents. They love their children and want to take care of them. They should be treated with respect.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state. The government should not make laws based on one person's religion. This would be hypocritical.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or flawed. But this is not true. Many experts have studied this issue and say it is not true.\n\nWe should listen to experts and not just our friends or neighbors. We should look at the facts and treat everyone with respect.",

A drug can be bad or good for your health.\n\nI think there should not be a law that makes marijuana available to the public. But it can be used to help people who are sick. There is no reason to say no to its good effects.\n\nIn hospitals, we use some medicines that are illegal. They are called controlled substances. These medicines are useful and we use them every day. If we deny the good effects of marijuana because it is a taboo, that is not fair.\n\nMarijuana is not like alcohol. If you abuse marijuana, it can cause problems. But if you abuse alcohol, it also causes problems. It is a difficult decision.\n\nI think marijuana should not be made legal suddenly. It should be made legal in small steps. If it is made legal all at once, people might abuse it. But if we remove the bad image of marijuana, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad opinion of marijuana because it is illegal. But it is not as bad as other drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we change people's minds about marijuana, they might use it for medical reasons.",

People wear casual clothes, like jeans and t-shirts. Even on Sundays, people wear casual clothes. In the summer, people wear beach clothes. Some people are late to church.\n\nThe church is not as formal as it used to be. People dress more casually now. This is the main thing I noticed.\n\nI do not know the church's rules and politics.

I think the church could not have stopped these problems. Some men who are married still abuse children. It is not because they are married or not married. It is because of the person's choice.\n\nSome religions allow priests to be married. But it does not stop the abuse. The person's choice is to abuse or not to abuse.\n\nI think people are born with their sexuality. It is not because of how they are raised. Genetics are important. You cannot hide your genetics with a marriage. If you try to hide it, it will come out.\n\nThe church cannot stop people from abusing children. If they know about it and hide it, that is wrong.

I think the Bush administration lied to the American people and did not admit to it. Even Colin Powell later said he was not sure about the evidence. This is wrong and can be punished.\n\nI think the Bush administration does not respect the American Constitution. They have tried to change it since 9/11.

We must think about the good and the bad. \n\nI don't think we should stay in Iraq anymore. We have not found a good reason to stay. If we leave slowly over a year or more, I don't have a problem. But I don't think we should stay any longer.\n\nMost Iraqis want us to leave. They think we should be gone in a year. They are the people we are trying to help. If they say leave, we should listen. If things go badly, we can say we did what they wanted.\n\nWe can be the good guys if we leave. We will never be fully accepted in the Middle East, but we will be better than we are now.",
            "I think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It is not only for women, but also for men in certain jobs.\n\nWomen often face more difficulties in many areas. This is because of a thing called the glass ceiling. It means even if there is supposed to be equality, it is hard for people to accept a woman as their boss. This is because of how society has been for a long time.\n\nIn many jobs, women can do all the work, but they may not get promoted because it is not common for women to be in charge. This is not only for women, but also for men in jobs like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.\n\nIn some societies, men are expected to work and make money, not stay home with the children. If a man stays home, people may think he is not doing the right thing. They may look down on him.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who like fashion may not be taken seriously if they are not like other men. People may think they do not know what fashion is for women. But this is changing.\n\nIt is slow to change, but women are getting more accepted in business and becoming CEOs. Men who stay home with their children are also becoming more accepted. People are starting to understand that women can have good jobs and men can stay home with the children.\n\nTo change this, we need to show the good qualities of people who are stereotyped. We should not push people to accept change, but show them the good things. If we do it too fast, people will resist. We have made good progress, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can be discriminated against because of where they are from or their job. For example, if someone from a farm goes to a big city and gets a job as a CEO, other people may not take him seriously because of his accent or grammar.\n\nHowever, this is not just between men and women. People from different places can also be discriminated against.",
            "My understanding is that some places don't make marijuana use a crime. Instead, they give a ticket to people who use it. This is like getting a traffic ticket. It means you don't get arrested and go to jail.\n\nThis change is good because it saves money. It costs a lot to arrest and take people to court. It costs money to pay for judges, public defenders, and the police. Some places are not willing to change the law, even if it would save them money. But some places, like Denver, are more open-minded.\n\nIn Denver, people can use marijuana and it's not a big problem. This means the city has more money to spend on good things, like education and programs to help the elderly and people who don't have food.\n\nPeople should think carefully about marijuana. It's not good for everyone to use it all the time. There are reasons why it's not good to use it in public. Some people might think it's not right to see people smoking marijuana in public.\n\nAlcohol can cause problems too. It can hurt your ability to drive and make decisions. Marijuana can also cause problems, but it's different for different people. Some people can use it and it doesn't affect them much. Others might have a harder time.\n\nIt's hard to say how people will react to marijuana because everyone is different. Some people can control how much they use, and some people can't. We should be careful when thinking about marijuana because it can have bad effects on people's lives.",
            "I think yes. \n\nBecause many things about the Catholic Church are old customs. \n\nThey do things in the same way for a long time. This is good because it helps keep traditions. \n\nBut it's also important to change. \n\nMany Catholics believe they must go to church every week. They are strict about how things are done. \n\nSometimes I think the Catholic Church does not respect people who do not follow all the rules. They do not like people from other religions. \n\nFor example, my mom was Episcopalian and my dad was too. They wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, but they could not because of my dad's religion. \n\nThis is not being kind to others. The Catholic Church teaches to love others. But it's not kind to not accept people who are different. \n\nI think some Catholic rules are good, but the way the Church acts is different. It's not fair to say one thing and do another. \n\nI do not think this would change how I feel. I think it would be good to allow priests to marry, but it might not stop them from behaving badly. \n\nPeople who hurt children might do this no matter if they are married or not. \n\nSo, I do not think allowing priests to marry would stop this from happening. It would still happen.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. \nI don't know if one side is right or wrong. \nThis is a very difficult problem. \nIt is between the church and the government. \nWe must define marriage without hurting anyone's feelings. \nI am not sure how to do this. \n\nAll civil unions are the same. \nBut the government may or may not give them the same rights. \nIf two people are married, they should be treated the same as anyone else. \nThis is a civil union, not a church thing. \n\nTwo people are together, that is all. \nThe government should not ask about the church. \nThe fact that some people are gay does not matter. \nThey are still two people in a union. \n\nIf all states agree, they should make it a federal law. \nMaking a rule in the constitution to stop gay marriage is not right. \nThis is not important enough to change the constitution. \nWe should not change the constitution just for one big issue. \n\nI don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. For me, homosexuality is a difficult issue. I have many gay friends. \n\nI do not agree with all aspects of their lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. It should not be a national problem. Each state should decide for itself. The president should not make a rule for the whole country.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are republican. Democratic states will likely support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you should respect its decision. You chose to live there.\n\nI think gay people should have the same rights as straight people. Each state should decide if it wants to allow gay marriage. It is a state's choice.\n\nI already said this. I do not think the president should decide for the whole country. George Bush should not decide how all states should be. Each state should decide for itself. He does not live in every state.\n\nSome things should be decided by each state. The president will leave office soon. If a new president wants to change the law, it will change back and forth. It is better if each state decides for itself. They will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not think the president should make this decision. It should be up to each state.",
            "When I think about Myspace, I remember it's a public website. If you post something there, everyone can see it. This includes school officials.\n\nIf you post something on the internet, you should think about who can see it.  School officials can look at Myspace, even if they're not looking for something under the school's name. They can see it from their homes.\n\nIn my opinion, school officials have the right to see things on the internet if it helps keep students safe. If they see something that prevents a school shooting, that's good.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing. But I think this is an invasion of privacy. However, if they help keep students safe, I don't think it's an invasion.\n\nIt's true that the internet is a public place. But the school should be a safe place. If school officials can make it safer, that's okay.\n\nWhen you post something on the internet, it's hard to control who sees it. If you write something bad about someone, you might regret it. The person could see it and it could hurt you.\n\nIn this case, the school officials were trying to keep students safe. They were checking the internet to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nSchool officials are like parents. When parents drop off their children at school, they want to know the school is a safe place. School officials have to make sure the school is safe.\n\nI was in a public high school, and we practiced lockdown drills in case of an attack. We wanted to be prepared. The school officials were trying to do the same thing. They were checking the internet to keep students safe.\n\nThey were preventing something bad from happening, like a school shooting. They were doing what was necessary to make the school a safer place.",
            "I was affected by the attack on 9/11. At first, I thought we should go to war. I wanted to help.\n\nBut I now think we made a mistake. We did not think about the long-term effects of our actions.\n\nWe did not plan carefully. We went to war without a clear goal. This led to problems.\n\nI do not think we helped the people in that area. They fight among themselves. They cannot work together.\n\nIf they cannot work together, it does not matter if we are there or not. Our presence did not make things better.\n\nI am sad about what happened on 9/11. But now I do not care about the situation in that area. They are not interested in helping themselves.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They fight in a way that is not civilized. Our goal was not to improve their country, but to get us out of there. I think that is a good idea.\n\nWe should have thought about what might happen before we went to war. We were angry and wanted revenge. We did not think about the future.\n\nThe President declared war on Iraq. I understand why he did it. But we should have had a clear plan.\n\nWe did not know what to do in that area. We did not have a clear goal. We did not have a plan to create order. This made things worse.\n\nI do not think we can change those people. They will always be the same. We are not doing enough to help them. We are only hurting ourselves by staying there.\n\nWe have made some progress, but it is not enough. It is time to leave. If we do not, things will only get worse. We cannot stay there forever."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think gay marriage is a good idea. I don't think people are born straight or gay by choice. They are born that way. So, I don't think gay people should be blamed for their sexual orientation.\n\nI don't think it's fair to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. That's not right. People should be free to love and marry whoever they want.\n\nThe government should not decide who can get married. Marriage is a personal choice. If two people love each other, they should be allowed to marry. It's not the government's business.\n\nGay people should not be punished for being who they are. They should be treated with respect. Everyone is different, and that's okay.\n\nThe government has more important things to worry about than who gets married. They should focus on keeping us safe and helping people who need it. Marriage is a personal choice, and the government should not get involved.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. \n\nThere is no good reason not to. \n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. \n\nGay couples are different, and so are straight couples. They are like two sides of the same coin. \n\nEach side is not better or worse than the other. \n\nIn fact, gay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should have the same rights as well. \n\nFor example, if you are in a gay relationship, your partner may not be able to visit you in the hospital. This is not fair. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success as straight couples. They have the same factors that keep their relationships strong. \n\nThe main issue is that some people do not want gay couples to get married in a church. But this is not the same as a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the church and government are separate, this should not be a problem. \n\nIn some countries, a civil union is allowed but not marriage. This is like being separate but unequal. \n\nGay couples have the same kind of relationship as straight couples. They play the same roles and have the same responsibilities. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and community issues. They think that gay couples will affect their community. \n\nBut the truth is that children of gay couples are the same as children of straight couples. They need love and care, not because of their parents' sexual orientation. \n\nIn some places, like New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. This is because they have been treated poorly in public schools. \n\nBut it's not the parents' fault. It's the fault of the people who treat them poorly. \n\nThe government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, but they are based on his religion. This is not a good reason to make a law. \n\nThe government should not enforce one group's morality on the whole country. This is unfair and hypocritical. \n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or abnormal. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. \n\nWe should listen to facts and research, not just what our neighbors or friends think. \n\nIf we do, we will see that gay couples are just like straight couples. They deserve the same rights.",

They are controlled because they can be bad if not used correctly. \n\nBut because they have good qualities, we use them in the pharmacy. If we think marijuana has good qualities, we should use it too. \n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If you use too much of either one, bad things can happen. \n\nHowever, we could make marijuana legal, but not all at once. We should make people understand that it is not bad first. Then maybe people will use it correctly. \n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine.

            "I think the church has changed a lot in the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I would wear nice dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. We would attend a long church service.\n\nNow, the church has a shorter service, only 30 minutes. People dress more casually, even on Sundays. In the summer, some people wear beach clothes. Families sometimes come in late. The church has become more casual.\n\nThe biggest change I noticed is how people dress. Even in the morning services, people wear jeans and khakis. It's a big change from when I was younger.\n\nI don't know much about the church's politics. But I think the church changed for the better.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I think some bad things could not have been prevented. There are married men who are pedophiles. Even if they were allowed to get married, it wouldn't stop them from being pedophiles. It's not because they are allowed or not allowed to get married.\n\nSome religions allow married priests or ministers. For example, the Seventh-day Adventist Church has married ministers. If someone wants to be a priest and get married, they might choose a different religion.\n\nI think people are born with their sexuality, and it's based on genetics. You can't change it, even through marriage. If someone is a pedophile, it will show. If the church knew about the problem and tried to hide it, they should be ashamed. But I don't think they knew in all cases.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea at first. But then the September 11th attacks happened. The United States went to war in Iraq. I think we used false reasons to go to war.

Even Colin Powell said he was not sure about the evidence when he was presenting it to the UN. This is wrong. It is a serious mistake to lie to the people.\n\nI think the Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution. They have been trying to make it less important since the September 11th attacks. They wanted to go to war from the start.\n\nA former government official said that George Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of a personal reason. He wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein. This is not a good reason for war.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If we leave now, the country might fall into a civil war and many more people will die. But I do not think it is a good idea to stay either. The US and the UN are trying to get other countries in the area to help Iraq. But this might cause more problems in the long run.\n\nIraq's government is not working well. The Parliament is not effective and the Prime Minister does not have control. A strong leader, Muqtada al-Sadr, has 20 seats in the Parliament and is causing problems.

Even most of the U.S. troops in Iraq think it was a bad idea. They want to leave within a year.\n\nThe Iraq War has been a disaster since the beginning. It was already a problem before the U.S. got involved. Now, leaving will also be difficult. There is a big cultural difference between the United States and the Middle East. It is hard for the U.S. government to understand and fix this problem.\n\nThe U.S. government wanted to bring democracy to Iraq, but this is not what the Iraqis wanted. Saddam Hussein was a bad man, but the U.S. should have thought about the pros and cons before invading Iraq.\n\nI do not think it is good for the U.S. to stay in Iraq. The administration may have some ideas for why we should stay, but I do not agree. If we leave slowly, that is okay. But, I do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq.\n\nMost Iraqis think the U.S. should leave within a year. If we ask them, they will say what they want. If something goes wrong, we can say it is not our fault. We will be the good guys if we leave now. At least we will be better than we are now.",
            "There is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This problem exists in many areas of work.\n\nNot just for women, but also for men. The kind of work a person does affects how they are treated. In some areas, women have a harder time getting ahead. This is because of a idea that men are usually in charge. But this is not always true.\n\nEven if a woman has the qualifications and skills for a job, she may not be chosen for it. This is because of how people think women should be treated. But it's not just women who face this problem.\n\nMen also face issues. For example, in the fashion industry, men who are interested in fashion are often not taken seriously. This is because people think men who like fashion are not 'normal'. But this is changing.\n\nSome men are now staying home to take care of their children, which is not common. People often look down on them because they think men should be the ones working to make money. But this is not always true.\n\nChange is slow. But we are making progress. More women are becoming leaders and getting accepted in business. This is a good thing.\n\nWe need to show the good qualities of people who are often treated unfairly. We should not force people to accept change, but let them see the good things about these individuals. This way, people will be more likely to accept them.\n\nWe have made a lot of progress, but change takes time. We should be patient and continue to work towards making things fairer. We are at a good point now, where people are starting to accept change.\n\nOther problems exist, like people being treated unfairly because of where they are from or how they speak. This is another example of how people are treated unfairly because of how they are different.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana was not made legal.  It was decriminalized.  This means it is no longer a serious crime.  Instead, it is like getting a traffic ticket.  You get in trouble, but not arrested.\n\nIf you get a marijuana ticket, it can affect your life.  It can affect your job or how you look in front of a judge.  Usually, having a drug charge is bad.  But when something is decriminalized, these bad effects are not as bad.\n\nSome people think decriminalizing marijuana is not a good idea.  They think it costs too much money to arrest and put people in jail.  It also costs money to go to court.  But some places are willing to make this change.  They think it will save money.\n\nIn Denver, people are more open-minded.  They think it is okay to decriminalize marijuana.  This city has more money now to help people.  They can spend it on education, food for the homeless, and other important things.\n\nI think it's good to decriminalize marijuana.  It's not good to have it just anywhere.  There are many reasons for this.  One reason is money.  Another reason is that some people might smoke and drive.  This is not good.  Many people think smoking marijuana is taboo.  We should not have it in public.\n\nAlcohol can be bad for people.  It can affect their driving.  But marijuana can affect how people live their lives.  Some people can use it and be fine.  Others cannot.  It depends on the person.\n\nWe cannot say that one substance is always bad.  Everyone reacts differently.  Some people can control themselves.  Others cannot.  We should be careful when we talk about substances.",
            "I agree. \nThere are good reasons for the Catholic Church's old customs. \nThey do many things the same way for a long time. \nThis is good because it shows respect for tradition. \nHowever, it is also important to be flexible and change when necessary.\n\nThe Catholic Church says its followers must go to church every week. \nThey have rules for everything. \nSometimes, it seems like the Church does not accept people who do not follow the rules perfectly. \nIt also does not accept people of other religions. \nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry us because my dad was not Catholic.\n\nThis is not showing love and acceptance of others. \nThe Catholic Church says to love others, but it does not act that way. \nMany Catholic rules tell people to do one thing, but the Church does not follow those rules.\n\nI do not think allowing priests to be married would stop them from doing bad things. \nPeople who hurt children will do it anyway. \nThey are hurting children, not grown-ups. \nSo, marriage or not, they will still hurt children. \nI do not think allowing priests to be married would make a difference.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I do not know if one side is right and the other is wrong. This is a very difficult topic. It is hard to decide without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a big problem. Defining marriage is also hard. Some people think marriage is between a man and a woman. Others think it is between two people who love each other.\n\nIf marriage is a sacrament, the government should not make rules about it. But if marriage is not a sacrament, the government should give tax breaks to married couples.\n\nI think marriage should be considered a civil union. It is two people who love each other. The government should not worry about what kind of marriage it is.\n\nIf all the states agree on this issue, the government should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not important enough to change the constitution.\n\nIn simple words, we should not change the constitution to ban gay marriage. Two people who love each other should have the same rights as anyone else.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. But I have friends who are gay. This makes the issue of homosexuality unclear for me. I do not agree with every aspect of the gay lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. It is not a matter for the whole country. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, and some are Republican. Democratic states usually support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows gay marriage, it is your choice. If the state decides to make gay marriage legal, you should accept the decision. This is because you chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. So, each state should decide whether to make gay marriage legal.\n\nI already said this. But I want to say it again. The president should not decide for the whole country. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nGeorge Bush is against gay marriage. But he cannot decide for all the states. He does not live in every state. It is not his decision to make.\n\nSome things should be decided by each state. The president will not be in office forever. If a new president wants to change the law, it will just go back and forth. Each state should make its own decision. They will have to live with the result.",
            "Myspace is a public website. If you post something on it, everyone can see it. School officials have the right to see it because they can access it from their homes. \n\nImagine someone is posting something on Myspace that could cause a school shooting. School officials should be able to see that to prevent it. They have a responsibility to make sure the school is safe.\n\nSchool officials might go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing. They do this to keep the school safe. Some people think this is an invasion of privacy. But I don't think so. If it helps keep the school safe, it's okay.\n\nIt's easier to express yourself when you write. But on Myspace, everything you post is public. It's not a good idea to say things you don't want others to see. Once you post something on the internet, it's there forever.\n\nSchool officials should not just go on the internet to catch students. But if they have a good reason, like to make the school safer, it's okay. When parents drop off their children at school, they expect it to be a safe place. School officials have a responsibility to make that happen.\n\nThe school had to prepare for emergencies, like school shootings, by doing drills. This is to keep the school safe. School officials were doing the same thing in this case. They were trying to prevent bad things from happening.\n\nThe purpose of the school officials going on the internet was to make the school a safer place. They wanted to prevent something like the Columbine school shooting from happening.",
            "I was for the war at first. It was because I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to fight back. But then I thought about it more. I realized we were not ready for war. We did not have a plan. We just went in without thinking about the long-term effects.\n\nI think we made a mistake. Going to war was not the right decision. The people in that country are fighting each other. They cannot fight us if they are busy fighting themselves. Our being there is not helping. \n\nI do not care about what happens in that country anymore. They are not like us. They fight in a different way. It is not like our war. They are not trying to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were not thinking clearly. We were angry and wanted revenge. President Bush declared war on Iraq. I understand why he did it. The people wanted to fight back. But we did not plan well. We did not know what to do when we got there.\n\nWe should have made a better plan. We should have thought about what would happen after the war. We did not have unity. We did not know what we were doing. That would have helped us.\n\nI do not think we can change those people. They are always going to be like that. \n\nWe are not making progress. We made some progress, but not enough. I think we should leave. Once we leave, their country will fall apart. We cannot stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should just leave."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think gay marriage is a good idea. I don't think people are born straight or gay by choice. They are born that way. So, I don't think gay people should be blamed for their sexual orientation.\n\nI don't think it's fair to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. That's not right. People should be free to love and marry whoever they want.\n\nThe government should not decide who can get married. Marriage is a personal choice. If two people love each other, they should be allowed to marry. It's not the government's business.\n\nGay people should not be punished for being who they are. They should be treated with respect. Everyone is different, and that's okay.\n\nThe government has more important things to worry about than who gets married. They should focus on keeping us safe and helping people who need it. Marriage is a personal choice, and the government should not get involved.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. \n\nThere is no good reason not to. \n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. \n\nGay couples are different, and so are straight couples. They are like two sides of the same coin. \n\nEach side is not better or worse than the other. \n\nIn fact, gay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should have the same rights as well. \n\nFor example, if you are in a gay relationship, your partner may not be able to visit you in the hospital. This is not fair. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success as straight couples. They have the same factors that keep their relationships strong. \n\nThe main issue is that some people do not want gay couples to get married in a church. But this is not the same as a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the church and government are separate, this should not be a problem. \n\nIn some countries, a civil union is allowed but not marriage. This is like being separate but unequal. \n\nGay couples have the same kind of relationship as straight couples. They play the same roles and have the same responsibilities. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and community issues. They think that gay couples will affect their community. \n\nBut the truth is that children of gay couples are the same as children of straight couples. They need love and care, not because of their parents' sexual orientation. \n\nIn some places, like New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. This is because they have been treated poorly in public schools. \n\nBut it's not the parents' fault. It's the fault of the people who treat them poorly. \n\nThe government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, but they are based on his religion. This is not a good reason to make a law. \n\nThe government should not enforce one group's morality on the whole country. This is unfair and hypocritical. \n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or abnormal. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. \n\nWe should listen to facts and research, not just what our neighbors or friends think. \n\nIf we do, we will see that gay couples are just like straight couples. They deserve the same rights.",

They are controlled because they can be bad if not used correctly. \n\nBut because they have good qualities, we use them in the pharmacy. If we think marijuana has good qualities, we should use it too. \n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If you use too much of either one, bad things can happen. \n\nHowever, we could make marijuana legal, but not all at once. We should make people understand that it is not bad first. Then maybe people will use it correctly. \n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine.

            "I think the church has changed a lot in the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I would wear nice dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. We would attend a long church service.\n\nNow, the church has a shorter service, only 30 minutes. People dress more casually, even on Sundays. In the summer, some people wear beach clothes. Families sometimes come in late. The church has become more casual.\n\nThe biggest change I noticed is how people dress. Even in the morning services, people wear jeans and khakis. It's a big change from when I was younger.\n\nI don't know much about the church's politics. But I think the church changed for the better.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I think some bad things could not have been prevented. There are married men who are pedophiles. Even if they were allowed to get married, it wouldn't stop them from being pedophiles. It's not because they are allowed or not allowed to get married.\n\nSome religions allow married priests or ministers. For example, the Seventh-day Adventist Church has married ministers. If someone wants to be a priest and get married, they might choose a different religion.\n\nI think people are born with their sexuality, and it's based on genetics. You can't change it, even through marriage. If someone is a pedophile, it will show. If the church knew about the problem and tried to hide it, they should be ashamed. But I don't think they knew in all cases.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea at first. But then the September 11th attacks happened. The United States went to war in Iraq. I think we used false reasons to go to war.

Even Colin Powell said he was not sure about the evidence when he was presenting it to the UN. This is wrong. It is a serious mistake to lie to the people.\n\nI think the Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution. They have been trying to make it less important since the September 11th attacks. They wanted to go to war from the start.\n\nA former government official said that George Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of a personal reason. He wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein. This is not a good reason for war.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If we leave now, the country might fall into a civil war and many more people will die. But I do not think it is a good idea to stay either. The US and the UN are trying to get other countries in the area to help Iraq. But this might cause more problems in the long run.\n\nIraq's government is not working well. The Parliament is not effective and the Prime Minister does not have control. A strong leader, Muqtada al-Sadr, has 20 seats in the Parliament and is causing problems.

Even most of the U.S. troops in Iraq think it was a bad idea. They want to leave within a year.\n\nThe Iraq War has been a disaster since the beginning. It was already a problem before the U.S. got involved. Now, leaving will also be difficult. There is a big cultural difference between the United States and the Middle East. It is hard for the U.S. government to understand and fix this problem.\n\nThe U.S. government wanted to bring democracy to Iraq, but this is not what the Iraqis wanted. Saddam Hussein was a bad man, but the U.S. should have thought about the pros and cons before invading Iraq.\n\nI do not think it is good for the U.S. to stay in Iraq. The administration may have some ideas for why we should stay, but I do not agree. If we leave slowly, that is okay. But, I do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq.\n\nMost Iraqis think the U.S. should leave within a year. If we ask them, they will say what they want. If something goes wrong, we can say it is not our fault. We will be the good guys if we leave now. At least we will be better than we are now.",
            "There is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This problem exists in many areas of work.\n\nNot just for women, but also for men. The kind of work a person does affects how they are treated. In some areas, women have a harder time getting ahead. This is because of a idea that men are usually in charge. But this is not always true.\n\nEven if a woman has the qualifications and skills for a job, she may not be chosen for it. This is because of how people think women should be treated. But it's not just women who face this problem.\n\nMen also face issues. For example, in the fashion industry, men who are interested in fashion are often not taken seriously. This is because people think men who like fashion are not 'normal'. But this is changing.\n\nSome men are now staying home to take care of their children, which is not common. People often look down on them because they think men should be the ones working to make money. But this is not always true.\n\nChange is slow. But we are making progress. More women are becoming leaders and getting accepted in business. This is a good thing.\n\nWe need to show the good qualities of people who are often treated unfairly. We should not force people to accept change, but let them see the good things about these individuals. This way, people will be more likely to accept them.\n\nWe have made a lot of progress, but change takes time. We should be patient and continue to work towards making things fairer. We are at a good point now, where people are starting to accept change.\n\nOther problems exist, like people being treated unfairly because of where they are from or how they speak. This is another example of how people are treated unfairly because of how they are different.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana was not made legal.  It was decriminalized.  This means it is no longer a serious crime.  Instead, it is like getting a traffic ticket.  You get in trouble, but not arrested.\n\nIf you get a marijuana ticket, it can affect your life.  It can affect your job or how you look in front of a judge.  Usually, having a drug charge is bad.  But when something is decriminalized, these bad effects are not as bad.\n\nSome people think decriminalizing marijuana is not a good idea.  They think it costs too much money to arrest and put people in jail.  It also costs money to go to court.  But some places are willing to make this change.  They think it will save money.\n\nIn Denver, people are more open-minded.  They think it is okay to decriminalize marijuana.  This city has more money now to help people.  They can spend it on education, food for the homeless, and other important things.\n\nI think it's good to decriminalize marijuana.  It's not good to have it just anywhere.  There are many reasons for this.  One reason is money.  Another reason is that some people might smoke and drive.  This is not good.  Many people think smoking marijuana is taboo.  We should not have it in public.\n\nAlcohol can be bad for people.  It can affect their driving.  But marijuana can affect how people live their lives.  Some people can use it and be fine.  Others cannot.  It depends on the person.\n\nWe cannot say that one substance is always bad.  Everyone reacts differently.  Some people can control themselves.  Others cannot.  We should be careful when we talk about substances.",
            "I agree. \nThere are good reasons for the Catholic Church's old customs. \nThey do many things the same way for a long time. \nThis is good because it shows respect for tradition. \nHowever, it is also important to be flexible and change when necessary.\n\nThe Catholic Church says its followers must go to church every week. \nThey have rules for everything. \nSometimes, it seems like the Church does not accept people who do not follow the rules perfectly. \nIt also does not accept people of other religions. \nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry us because my dad was not Catholic.\n\nThis is not showing love and acceptance of others. \nThe Catholic Church says to love others, but it does not act that way. \nMany Catholic rules tell people to do one thing, but the Church does not follow those rules.\n\nI do not think allowing priests to be married would stop them from doing bad things. \nPeople who hurt children will do it anyway. \nThey are hurting children, not grown-ups. \nSo, marriage or not, they will still hurt children. \nI do not think allowing priests to be married would make a difference.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I do not know if one side is right and the other is wrong. This is a very difficult topic. It is hard to decide without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a big problem. Defining marriage is also hard. Some people think marriage is between a man and a woman. Others think it is between two people who love each other.\n\nIf marriage is a sacrament, the government should not make rules about it. But if marriage is not a sacrament, the government should give tax breaks to married couples.\n\nI think marriage should be considered a civil union. It is two people who love each other. The government should not worry about what kind of marriage it is.\n\nIf all the states agree on this issue, the government should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not important enough to change the constitution.\n\nIn simple words, we should not change the constitution to ban gay marriage. Two people who love each other should have the same rights as anyone else.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. But I have friends who are gay. This makes the issue of homosexuality unclear for me. I do not agree with every aspect of the gay lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. It is not a matter for the whole country. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, and some are Republican. Democratic states usually support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows gay marriage, it is your choice. If the state decides to make gay marriage legal, you should accept the decision. This is because you chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. So, each state should decide whether to make gay marriage legal.\n\nI already said this. But I want to say it again. The president should not decide for the whole country. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nGeorge Bush is against gay marriage. But he cannot decide for all the states. He does not live in every state. It is not his decision to make.\n\nSome things should be decided by each state. The president will not be in office forever. If a new president wants to change the law, it will just go back and forth. Each state should make its own decision. They will have to live with the result.",
            "Myspace is a public website. If you post something on it, everyone can see it. School officials have the right to see it because they can access it from their homes. \n\nImagine someone is posting something on Myspace that could cause a school shooting. School officials should be able to see that to prevent it. They have a responsibility to make sure the school is safe.\n\nSchool officials might go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing. They do this to keep the school safe. Some people think this is an invasion of privacy. But I don't think so. If it helps keep the school safe, it's okay.\n\nIt's easier to express yourself when you write. But on Myspace, everything you post is public. It's not a good idea to say things you don't want others to see. Once you post something on the internet, it's there forever.\n\nSchool officials should not just go on the internet to catch students. But if they have a good reason, like to make the school safer, it's okay. When parents drop off their children at school, they expect it to be a safe place. School officials have a responsibility to make that happen.\n\nThe school had to prepare for emergencies, like school shootings, by doing drills. This is to keep the school safe. School officials were doing the same thing in this case. They were trying to prevent bad things from happening.\n\nThe purpose of the school officials going on the internet was to make the school a safer place. They wanted to prevent something like the Columbine school shooting from happening.",
            "I was for the war at first. It was because I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to fight back. But then I thought about it more. I realized we were not ready for war. We did not have a plan. We just went in without thinking about the long-term effects.\n\nI think we made a mistake. Going to war was not the right decision. The people in that country are fighting each other. They cannot fight us if they are busy fighting themselves. Our being there is not helping. \n\nI do not care about what happens in that country anymore. They are not like us. They fight in a different way. It is not like our war. They are not trying to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were not thinking clearly. We were angry and wanted revenge. President Bush declared war on Iraq. I understand why he did it. The people wanted to fight back. But we did not plan well. We did not know what to do when we got there.\n\nWe should have made a better plan. We should have thought about what would happen after the war. We did not have unity. We did not know what we were doing. That would have helped us.\n\nI do not think we can change those people. They are always going to be like that. \n\nWe are not making progress. We made some progress, but not enough. I think we should leave. Once we leave, their country will fall apart. We cannot stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should just leave."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think gay marriage is a good idea. I don't think people are born straight or gay by choice. They are born that way. So, I don't think gay people should be blamed for their sexual orientation.\n\nI don't think it's fair to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. That's not right. People should be free to love and marry whoever they want.\n\nThe government should not decide who can get married. Marriage is a personal choice. If two people love each other, they should be allowed to marry. It's not the government's business.\n\nGay people should not be punished for being who they are. They should be treated with respect. Everyone is different, and that's okay.\n\nThe government has more important things to worry about than who gets married. They should focus on keeping us safe and helping people who need it. Marriage is a personal choice, and the government should not get involved.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. \n\nThere is no good reason not to. \n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. \n\nGay couples are different, and so are straight couples. They are like two sides of the same coin. \n\nEach side is not better or worse than the other. \n\nIn fact, gay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should have the same rights as well. \n\nFor example, if you are in a gay relationship, your partner may not be able to visit you in the hospital. This is not fair. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success as straight couples. They have the same factors that keep their relationships strong. \n\nThe main issue is that some people do not want gay couples to get married in a church. But this is not the same as a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the church and government are separate, this should not be a problem. \n\nIn some countries, a civil union is allowed but not marriage. This is like being separate but unequal. \n\nGay couples have the same kind of relationship as straight couples. They play the same roles and have the same responsibilities. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and community issues. They think that gay couples will affect their community. \n\nBut the truth is that children of gay couples are the same as children of straight couples. They need love and care, not because of their parents' sexual orientation. \n\nIn some places, like New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. This is because they have been treated poorly in public schools. \n\nBut it's not the parents' fault. It's the fault of the people who treat them poorly. \n\nThe government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, but they are based on his religion. This is not a good reason to make a law. \n\nThe government should not enforce one group's morality on the whole country. This is unfair and hypocritical. \n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or abnormal. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. \n\nWe should listen to facts and research, not just what our neighbors or friends think. \n\nIf we do, we will see that gay couples are just like straight couples. They deserve the same rights.",

They are controlled because they can be bad if not used correctly. \n\nBut because they have good qualities, we use them in the pharmacy. If we think marijuana has good qualities, we should use it too. \n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If you use too much of either one, bad things can happen. \n\nHowever, we could make marijuana legal, but not all at once. We should make people understand that it is not bad first. Then maybe people will use it correctly. \n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine.

            "I think the church has changed a lot in the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I would wear nice dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. We would attend a long church service.\n\nNow, the church has a shorter service, only 30 minutes. People dress more casually, even on Sundays. In the summer, some people wear beach clothes. Families sometimes come in late. The church has become more casual.\n\nThe biggest change I noticed is how people dress. Even in the morning services, people wear jeans and khakis. It's a big change from when I was younger.\n\nI don't know much about the church's politics. But I think the church changed for the better.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I think some bad things could not have been prevented. There are married men who are pedophiles. Even if they were allowed to get married, it wouldn't stop them from being pedophiles. It's not because they are allowed or not allowed to get married.\n\nSome religions allow married priests or ministers. For example, the Seventh-day Adventist Church has married ministers. If someone wants to be a priest and get married, they might choose a different religion.\n\nI think people are born with their sexuality, and it's based on genetics. You can't change it, even through marriage. If someone is a pedophile, it will show. If the church knew about the problem and tried to hide it, they should be ashamed. But I don't think they knew in all cases.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea at first. But then the September 11th attacks happened. The United States went to war in Iraq. I think we used false reasons to go to war.

Even Colin Powell said he was not sure about the evidence when he was presenting it to the UN. This is wrong. It is a serious mistake to lie to the people.\n\nI think the Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution. They have been trying to make it less important since the September 11th attacks. They wanted to go to war from the start.\n\nA former government official said that George Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of a personal reason. He wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein. This is not a good reason for war.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If we leave now, the country might fall into a civil war and many more people will die. But I do not think it is a good idea to stay either. The US and the UN are trying to get other countries in the area to help Iraq. But this might cause more problems in the long run.\n\nIraq's government is not working well. The Parliament is not effective and the Prime Minister does not have control. A strong leader, Muqtada al-Sadr, has 20 seats in the Parliament and is causing problems.

Even most of the U.S. troops in Iraq think it was a bad idea. They want to leave within a year.\n\nThe Iraq War has been a disaster since the beginning. It was already a problem before the U.S. got involved. Now, leaving will also be difficult. There is a big cultural difference between the United States and the Middle East. It is hard for the U.S. government to understand and fix this problem.\n\nThe U.S. government wanted to bring democracy to Iraq, but this is not what the Iraqis wanted. Saddam Hussein was a bad man, but the U.S. should have thought about the pros and cons before invading Iraq.\n\nI do not think it is good for the U.S. to stay in Iraq. The administration may have some ideas for why we should stay, but I do not agree. If we leave slowly, that is okay. But, I do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq.\n\nMost Iraqis think the U.S. should leave within a year. If we ask them, they will say what they want. If something goes wrong, we can say it is not our fault. We will be the good guys if we leave now. At least we will be better than we are now.",
            "There is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This problem exists in many areas of work.\n\nNot just for women, but also for men. The kind of work a person does affects how they are treated. In some areas, women have a harder time getting ahead. This is because of a idea that men are usually in charge. But this is not always true.\n\nEven if a woman has the qualifications and skills for a job, she may not be chosen for it. This is because of how people think women should be treated. But it's not just women who face this problem.\n\nMen also face issues. For example, in the fashion industry, men who are interested in fashion are often not taken seriously. This is because people think men who like fashion are not 'normal'. But this is changing.\n\nSome men are now staying home to take care of their children, which is not common. People often look down on them because they think men should be the ones working to make money. But this is not always true.\n\nChange is slow. But we are making progress. More women are becoming leaders and getting accepted in business. This is a good thing.\n\nWe need to show the good qualities of people who are often treated unfairly. We should not force people to accept change, but let them see the good things about these individuals. This way, people will be more likely to accept them.\n\nWe have made a lot of progress, but change takes time. We should be patient and continue to work towards making things fairer. We are at a good point now, where people are starting to accept change.\n\nOther problems exist, like people being treated unfairly because of where they are from or how they speak. This is another example of how people are treated unfairly because of how they are different.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana was not made legal.  It was decriminalized.  This means it is no longer a serious crime.  Instead, it is like getting a traffic ticket.  You get in trouble, but not arrested.\n\nIf you get a marijuana ticket, it can affect your life.  It can affect your job or how you look in front of a judge.  Usually, having a drug charge is bad.  But when something is decriminalized, these bad effects are not as bad.\n\nSome people think decriminalizing marijuana is not a good idea.  They think it costs too much money to arrest and put people in jail.  It also costs money to go to court.  But some places are willing to make this change.  They think it will save money.\n\nIn Denver, people are more open-minded.  They think it is okay to decriminalize marijuana.  This city has more money now to help people.  They can spend it on education, food for the homeless, and other important things.\n\nI think it's good to decriminalize marijuana.  It's not good to have it just anywhere.  There are many reasons for this.  One reason is money.  Another reason is that some people might smoke and drive.  This is not good.  Many people think smoking marijuana is taboo.  We should not have it in public.\n\nAlcohol can be bad for people.  It can affect their driving.  But marijuana can affect how people live their lives.  Some people can use it and be fine.  Others cannot.  It depends on the person.\n\nWe cannot say that one substance is always bad.  Everyone reacts differently.  Some people can control themselves.  Others cannot.  We should be careful when we talk about substances.",
            "I agree. \nThere are good reasons for the Catholic Church's old customs. \nThey do many things the same way for a long time. \nThis is good because it shows respect for tradition. \nHowever, it is also important to be flexible and change when necessary.\n\nThe Catholic Church says its followers must go to church every week. \nThey have rules for everything. \nSometimes, it seems like the Church does not accept people who do not follow the rules perfectly. \nIt also does not accept people of other religions. \nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry us because my dad was not Catholic.\n\nThis is not showing love and acceptance of others. \nThe Catholic Church says to love others, but it does not act that way. \nMany Catholic rules tell people to do one thing, but the Church does not follow those rules.\n\nI do not think allowing priests to be married would stop them from doing bad things. \nPeople who hurt children will do it anyway. \nThey are hurting children, not grown-ups. \nSo, marriage or not, they will still hurt children. \nI do not think allowing priests to be married would make a difference.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I do not know if one side is right and the other is wrong. This is a very difficult topic. It is hard to decide without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a big problem. Defining marriage is also hard. Some people think marriage is between a man and a woman. Others think it is between two people who love each other.\n\nIf marriage is a sacrament, the government should not make rules about it. But if marriage is not a sacrament, the government should give tax breaks to married couples.\n\nI think marriage should be considered a civil union. It is two people who love each other. The government should not worry about what kind of marriage it is.\n\nIf all the states agree on this issue, the government should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not important enough to change the constitution.\n\nIn simple words, we should not change the constitution to ban gay marriage. Two people who love each other should have the same rights as anyone else.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. But I have friends who are gay. This makes the issue of homosexuality unclear for me. I do not agree with every aspect of the gay lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. It is not a matter for the whole country. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, and some are Republican. Democratic states usually support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows gay marriage, it is your choice. If the state decides to make gay marriage legal, you should accept the decision. This is because you chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. So, each state should decide whether to make gay marriage legal.\n\nI already said this. But I want to say it again. The president should not decide for the whole country. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nGeorge Bush is against gay marriage. But he cannot decide for all the states. He does not live in every state. It is not his decision to make.\n\nSome things should be decided by each state. The president will not be in office forever. If a new president wants to change the law, it will just go back and forth. Each state should make its own decision. They will have to live with the result.",
            "Myspace is a public website. If you post something on it, everyone can see it. School officials have the right to see it because they can access it from their homes. \n\nImagine someone is posting something on Myspace that could cause a school shooting. School officials should be able to see that to prevent it. They have a responsibility to make sure the school is safe.\n\nSchool officials might go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing. They do this to keep the school safe. Some people think this is an invasion of privacy. But I don't think so. If it helps keep the school safe, it's okay.\n\nIt's easier to express yourself when you write. But on Myspace, everything you post is public. It's not a good idea to say things you don't want others to see. Once you post something on the internet, it's there forever.\n\nSchool officials should not just go on the internet to catch students. But if they have a good reason, like to make the school safer, it's okay. When parents drop off their children at school, they expect it to be a safe place. School officials have a responsibility to make that happen.\n\nThe school had to prepare for emergencies, like school shootings, by doing drills. This is to keep the school safe. School officials were doing the same thing in this case. They were trying to prevent bad things from happening.\n\nThe purpose of the school officials going on the internet was to make the school a safer place. They wanted to prevent something like the Columbine school shooting from happening.",
            "I was for the war at first. It was because I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to fight back. But then I thought about it more. I realized we were not ready for war. We did not have a plan. We just went in without thinking about the long-term effects.\n\nI think we made a mistake. Going to war was not the right decision. The people in that country are fighting each other. They cannot fight us if they are busy fighting themselves. Our being there is not helping. \n\nI do not care about what happens in that country anymore. They are not like us. They fight in a different way. It is not like our war. They are not trying to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were not thinking clearly. We were angry and wanted revenge. President Bush declared war on Iraq. I understand why he did it. The people wanted to fight back. But we did not plan well. We did not know what to do when we got there.\n\nWe should have made a better plan. We should have thought about what would happen after the war. We did not have unity. We did not know what we were doing. That would have helped us.\n\nI do not think we can change those people. They are always going to be like that. \n\nWe are not making progress. We made some progress, but not enough. I think we should leave. Once we leave, their country will fall apart. We cannot stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should just leave."

that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

If you disagree with the Catholic Church's views, you may not want to be part of the church. The Catholic Church does not allow women to be priests or for priests to be married.

            "I think gay marriage should be legal. \n\nThere is no good reason it should not be. \n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. \n\nIt's different. Similar to how two sides of a coin are different but equal. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. Like paying taxes and getting health care. \n\nBut now, if you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or make decisions for you. \n\nThis is not fair. Many studies show that gay couples have the same rates of success as straight couples. They have the same things that make a happy relationship. \n\nIt's just a relationship. The same as any other. \n\nThe problem is that people get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. But gay couples are only asking for a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government allows a civil union, why not a marriage? \n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. \n\nGay couples are the same in many ways. They have the same roles in a relationship. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and how it will affect the community. \n\nThey also worry about children of gay couples. Will they be treated unfairly by their peers and other adults? \n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they get bullied in regular schools. \n\nParents protest to take the child out of school. \n\nThis is not fair to the child. Parenting skills are the same for gay and straight couples. \n\nThe government should help make gay marriage legal in all states. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, based on his religion. But morality is different for everyone. \n\nThe government should not make laws based on one group's morality. It's not fair to ignore the culture and morality of others. \n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they believe being gay is a choice or a defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. \n\nWe should listen to experts, not just what our friends and neighbors say.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. I know some people think that because a drug is against the law, it cannot be good. But I do not agree. \n\nIf a drug is good for people, I think it should be available for them. However, making it available to the public is a different question. I do not think it should be available to everyone.\n\nBut, if a doctor says it can help someone, I think it should be used. Just because a drug is against the law does not mean it is bad. Many medicines are against the law, but doctors use them to help people. \n\nFor example, oxycodone and Vicodin are against the law, but they are used in pharmacies because they are helpful. If people think marijuana is bad just because it is against the law, it is not fair. We should think about its good properties.\n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If people drink too much alcohol, it can be bad for them. But if people use marijuana too much, it is not as bad. Maybe we should make marijuana legal, but not all at once. We should help people understand that it is not a bad thing.\n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they might use it responsibly. And it could be helpful for people who are sick.",
            "I think the church has changed to fit modern times. It is not as strict as it was in the past. When I was a child, I went to church every Sunday. I wore a new dress and matching shoes and handbag. It was a special part of my life. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nThe church now has a shorter service on Sundays, only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes and sometimes arrive late. This makes the church feel more relaxed.\n\nI also notice that people wear jeans and khaki pants to morning services. It's a big change from when I wore dresses and skirts. But it's not all bad – khaki pants are nice too.\n\nI don't know much about the church's rules and politics. But I think the church has become more casual.\n\nRegarding the problem of Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't think changing rules would have stopped it. Some men become pedophiles because of their genetics, not because of their choices. Even married men can become pedophiles. It's not because they are allowed to get married or not.\n\nSome religions allow their priests to get married, like Seventh-day Adventists. But even in those cases, some men still become pedophiles. I think it's the person's choice, not their faith, that makes them a pedophile.\n\nI think genetics play a big role in making people become pedophiles. It's not something they choose or learn. It's who they are. You can't change someone's genetics, even with a marriage.\n\nIf the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, that's wrong. But I don't think they always knew. If they did, they should have acted.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic church.",
            "The Iraq war is a very serious issue. I was not happy with the reason we went to war. The 9/11 attacks happened in September. Many people were still upset. I think the Bush administration used the Iraq war as an excuse. They said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but this was not true.\n\nI think the Bush administration lied to the American people. They said Saddam Hussein was connected to Osama Bin Laden. But this was not true. Colin Powell, a high official, said he was not sure of the evidence when he presented it to the UN. This is very bad. It is against the law for a president to lie to the people.\n\nI think the Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution. They have tried to make it weaker since 9/11. They wanted to go to war before they came into office. One of their officials wrote a book saying this. He said the younger Bush wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein because his father was mad at him.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If we leave now, many more people will die. The country may fall into civil war. The UN and the US are trying to find a new way. They want other countries in the area to help restore order. But I am not sure this is a good idea. Iraq will have trouble being a free country if other countries control it.\n\nThe government in Iraq is not working well. The Parliament is not effective. The Prime Minister does not have control.

But I do not think that is a good reason to stay there. It is causing problems for the people of Iraq. \n\nIf we stay in Iraq, we will have to try to build democracy. This takes a long time. If we leave, the Iraqis will be angry with us. They will have to start over again.\n\nI am not sure what to think. I think the war should not be called a war anymore. It was not declared as a war, so it is not a real war. I think we are in Iraq to show our power and to get their oil. \n\nThis is a problem. We are wasting our resources. The person in charge, President Bush, is looking bad because of the war. It is like the Vietnam War, which was also not declared as a war and was not successful.\n\nI know people who have family members in Iraq. Some of these family members are fighting in the war. I want the war to end because many people are suffering. But I also think that if we stay, we will try to change the culture of Iraq. This could make things worse.

            "I don't think it's right for a state to make a law about something that is against a church's rules. The constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control what churches do. It's very clear in the constitution.\n\nIf the government tries to make a law about this, it would go against what is already written in the constitution. This is not right. It would be like the government saying, \"We don't like your church's rules, so we will make a new law to stop you.\"\n\nSome people want to make a law against this, but I think that's not fair. They are choosing one church's rules over another. Many Catholics and Christians do not support this.

If the government makes a law about this, it would be wrong. It would be against what is already written in the constitution.\n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this issue. The president is trying to make a law because of his own personal beliefs. He is showing that he prefers one religion over others. This is not fair.\n\nThere is no good reason for a law against this.

            "The war in Iraq was a difficult and complicated issue. I think the US government was not honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, I believe the government tried to connect the war in Iraq to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. However, this connection was not clear.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq was similar to the Vietnam War. The US government did not learn from past mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government, but the government was not prepared for the consequences. \n\nThe aftermath of the war was chaotic and violent. The US tried to put a democratic government in Iraq, but this was not an easy task. It took years to implement a new form of government. In the US, it took a long time to establish a strong democracy.\n\nThe US government should have been more careful and prepared before invading Iraq. They should have thought about all possible outcomes. The government was not honest with the American people about the war. They made the war seem like a quick and easy victory.\n\nThe US government should not have gone to war without a clear plan. Many American troops are still dying in Iraq. The US is trying to train the Iraqi military and police to control their country. This is a long and difficult process.\n\nThe government made it seem like the war would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. However, this was not true. Implementing a new form of government takes a long time. It was not an easy thing to do in the US, and it will not be easy in Iraq.\n\nThe war in Iraq was a difficult decision. I had mixed feelings about it. In the 2004 presidential election, one of my reasons for voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, I now think that the US should try to leave Iraq, but it is hard because the US took away their government and way of life.\n\nThe US should consider the many American casualties and whether it is worth risking more lives for a free democratic Iraq. If we are invading Iraq to make it a democracy, why not help other countries? The main reason is oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. Another reason for the war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there will be peace. But I do not think this will happen soon.",
            "I support gay marriage. I have always supported it. It is a personal preference. Some people think it may be caused by biology, not by how we are raised.

People who love each other should be able to get married. This is not just a state or government issue, it is a personal issue.\n\nIn my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed to be. But they live like any other family. They walk their dogs like everyone else. I think it is not right for the government to decide what marriage is.\n\nResearch shows that being gay may be caused by something in the brain. People may be born this way. It is not because of how they are raised or their family.\n\nMarriage is a personal thing. If two people want to get married, they should be able to do it quietly, like anyone else. But if gay people want to get married, it becomes a big issue. This is not right.

            "I have a question. I was thinking about the fact that someone went online and saw something. This made a bad thing not happen. The person was on a website called Myspace. If you put information on the internet, it can be seen by many people. On Myspace, you need a friend to see someone's profile. But when you make someone a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information. So, if you put information on the internet, you should expect that many people will see it.\n\nThis is a difficult problem. If someone is watching students' profiles to prevent bad things, it's not fair to just look at certain students. But if someone sees something bad by chance, it's good that they can stop it. It depends on why they were looking at the profile.\n\nI have a Facebook account, but not a Myspace one. I know there are bad people who can see things about me. I saw a story on TV about a man who got information easily from someone's profile. He contacted her on instant messenger and she met him. I would not do that. Some people in my classes know me without knowing my name on the internet. They can find out where I am and who my friends are. It's hard to keep my personal things private.\n\nI limit what I put on the internet, but I also want to communicate with friends. I only accept friends I know. But I'm not sure who can see what.\n\nMy roommate told me about a school that banned Myspace. I don't know if this is a privacy issue. I don't know if the school had the right to tell students they couldn't have Myspace. That's my only other thought.",
            "The Iraq War is a big problem. I want to talk about it. I feel strange saying I was against it from the start. Many people agree it was a bad idea. Most people in the United States, Iraq, and the world think so. \n\nAccording to polls, about 75 to 80 percent of people think the war was a bad idea. In Iraq, 80 percent of people agree. Even 70 percent of US troops in Iraq think it was a mistake. They think the US should leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq is very bad. It was a problem before the US entered. Now, pulling out of Iraq will be difficult too. There is a big cultural difference between the US and countries in the Middle East. The US thinks it can bring democracy to these countries. However, this is not what the people want. Saddam was a bad leader, but you must think carefully before invading a country.\n\nI do not see a good reason for staying in Iraq. I have not heard a good reason to stay longer. If the US wants to leave slowly over time, I would not be against it. But I do not see a reason to stay.\n\nI read that 80 percent of Iraqis want the US to leave within a year. Some Iraqis even want the US to leave now. These are the people we want to help. Maybe they know what is best for them. If we ask them and they say they want us to leave, then we cannot blame them if things get worse.\n\nIf we leave, we can say we tried to help. If we decide to help them after that, we will be seen as good people. Not really, but it will be better than now.",
            "Gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It is not just for women. It also happens in the workplace. The field of work can make a difference. For example, in some jobs, people might think it is hard for a woman to be in charge. This is because society has a long history. In the past, women did not usually hold important positions.\n\nIn many places, people think it is strange for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. This is not always true. Some men want to be at home with their children. But society does not always accept this. People might think, \"Men should work and earn money for their families.\" This can be hard for men who choose to stay at home.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men may not be taken seriously if they like fashion. Some people think men who like fashion are not typical. They might think, \"How can a man know about fashion for women?\" This is a problem because it is not true. Men can know a lot about fashion.\n\nChange is slow. It takes time. But things are getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and getting important jobs. People are starting to accept this. It is also becoming more accepted for men to stay at home and take care of their children. \n\nWe need to promote the qualities of people who are often discriminated against. We should show their good qualities without being too pushy. If we force people to accept change, they might resist. We have made progress, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can be discriminated against based on their job, where they are from, or their gender. For example, someone from a farm might not have good grammar, but they might be very intelligent. They might work their way up to a CEO position. However, other men might think, \"How can I know if you are smart if you don't speak well?\"\n\nIn short, gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It affects women and men in different ways. It also affects people based on their job and where they are from.",
            "My understanding is that they did not make marijuana a crime.  Instead, they made it a minor offense.  You can get a ticket for it, but you will not be arrested.  This is a change from the past when it was a serious crime.\n\nSome people worry about the future problems that come with a marijuana charge, even if it is not a crime.  But there are two sides to this issue.  One side is that it costs a lot of money to arrest and try people for marijuana offenses.  This money could be used for other important things like education and helping the poor.\n\nIn some cities, people are against making marijuana legal because they do not want it to be easily available.  But in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded.  They think making marijuana legal is a good idea because it can bring in money for important programs.\n\nHowever, if marijuana were totally legal, it could be sold in stores like cigarettes.  This might lead to people smoking and driving, which is a problem.  Some people also think it would be uncomfortable to have marijuana out in the open.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol can cause problems.  Marijuana can affect people's lifestyles, and alcohol can affect their driving and decision-making.  Everyone reacts differently to substances, and some people have trouble controlling themselves.\n\nI think it is hard to say what the effects of marijuana will be because people react differently.  But I do think that both marijuana and alcohol have their own problems.",
            "I agree. \n\nBecause I think some things the Catholic Church does are very old. \n\nThey do the same things for a long time. \n\nThis is good. Tradition helps keep us strong. \n\nBut we also need to change with the times. \n\nMany Catholics go to Church every week. \n\nThe Church is strict about rules. \n\nSometimes I think the Church looks down on people who do not follow all the rules. \n\nThe Church does not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \n\nIt also does not accept people from other religions. \n\nFor example, my mom was from a different Christian group and my dad was from another one. \n\nThey could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \n\nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. \n\nCatholics are taught to love others. \n\nBut it is not fair to say we love others and then not accept them. \n\nSo, I think some Catholic teachings and practices do not match. \n\nThe Church is slow to change. \n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop them from hurting children. \n\nSome people who hurt children will do so no matter what. \n\nIt is not fair to compare a spouse to a child. \n\nThese things will probably happen anyway. \n\nTherefore, I do not think allowing priests to marry would be a solution.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I don't know if one side is right or wrong. This is a very difficult problem we face now. It is hard to solve without hurting anyone's feelings. \n\nMarriage and church are two things that are very close together. But we cannot define marriage without offending people. It's hard to decide what marriage is. Should the government decide how to look at marriage? Some people think marriage is a special thing, like a sacrament. If you are married, you get special tax breaks. But if you were baptized, you still get the same tax breaks. \n\nSo, if two people are married, the government should look at it as just a civil union. It's two people who are together. The government should not look at what kind of marriage it was. \n\nGay marriage is another problem. Two people who love each other should be able to have a civil union. \n\nIf all states can agree on this, they should make it a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution is very important. We should not change it for a small issue. \n\nSome people are very passionate about this issue. But it's not big enough to change the constitution. We should not change the constitution to ban gay marriage. \n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes me think about homosexuality in a complex way. I have many gay friends. I don't agree with their lifestyle, but I think it should be legal. I don't think it's a national issue. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are republican. Democratic states usually support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how they feel about this issue. I think you should respect their decision if they choose to legalize gay marriage. You chose to live there, so you should accept their laws.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. This is why I think each state should be able to decide about gay marriage. I already said this, but I want to say it again. I don't think the president should decide for the whole country. President Bush is against gay marriage, but he can't decide for all states. This is because he doesn't live in every state.\n\nI think some things should be decided by each state. If a president changes the law, it will just change back when another president is elected. The states will have to live with their decisions, not the president. If a president lifts the ban on gay marriage in some states, it will not be the same in other states.\n\nI don't agree with President Bush's decision. I think each state should be able to make its own choice about gay marriage.",
            "Myspace is a public place on the Internet. If you put something on it, everyone can see it. This includes school officials. You can't hide it even if you don't use your school name.\n\nWhen you post on the Internet, people will see it. This includes school officials. They can see it from their homes. They may see things that students are not supposed to do. If they see something that can prevent a school shooting, they can take action.\n\nI think school officials can see what students are doing on Myspace. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is their responsibility. They want to make the school a safe place.\n\nSchools have rules to protect students. They practice lock downs in case of emergency. This helps them be prepared for bad things that can happen.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to make sure students are safe. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is good for everyone.\n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy if they look at Myspace to keep students safe. If they see something bad, they can take action. This is their job.\n\nWhen you write something, it can come back to you. This is why you should be careful what you say. If you say something bad, it can hurt you.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to make sure students are not doing bad things. If they see something, they can help. This is good for everyone.\n\nIn my opinion, school officials can look at Myspace to make the school a safer place. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is their job.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I wanted to help. I was affected by the 9/11 attacks. I thought we should go to their country and stop the bad things they did to us.\n\nHowever, I think we did not think about the long-term effects. We did not prepare well and did not have a good plan. This may have led to problems.\n\nNow, I am against the war. I do not think it helped. When countries fight each other, they cannot attack us. If they cannot work together, we cannot change them.\n\nI do not care about what happens in their country. They fight a lot and cannot work together. This makes it hard for us to help them.\n\nWar is different in their country than in ours. They fight in a way that is not civilized. I do not think they want to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were not thinking clearly. We were looking for revenge, not for a good reason. President Bush wanted to declare war on Iraq. I understand why, but we did not have a good plan.\n\nI think we should have helped them in a better way. We did not have unity and did not know what we were doing. A clear plan would have been helpful.\n\nI do not think we can change their country. They will always be like that. We are not making enough progress. We have made some progress, but not enough to stay. If we leave, their country will probably collapse.\n\nWe are hurting ourselves by staying in their country. We cannot stay there forever. I think we should leave and let them solve their own problems."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

If you disagree with the Catholic Church's views, you may not want to be part of the church. The Catholic Church does not allow women to be priests or for priests to be married.

            "I think gay marriage should be legal. \n\nThere is no good reason it should not be. \n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. \n\nIt's different. Similar to how two sides of a coin are different but equal. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. Like paying taxes and getting health care. \n\nBut now, if you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or make decisions for you. \n\nThis is not fair. Many studies show that gay couples have the same rates of success as straight couples. They have the same things that make a happy relationship. \n\nIt's just a relationship. The same as any other. \n\nThe problem is that people get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. But gay couples are only asking for a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government allows a civil union, why not a marriage? \n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. \n\nGay couples are the same in many ways. They have the same roles in a relationship. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and how it will affect the community. \n\nThey also worry about children of gay couples. Will they be treated unfairly by their peers and other adults? \n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they get bullied in regular schools. \n\nParents protest to take the child out of school. \n\nThis is not fair to the child. Parenting skills are the same for gay and straight couples. \n\nThe government should help make gay marriage legal in all states. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, based on his religion. But morality is different for everyone. \n\nThe government should not make laws based on one group's morality. It's not fair to ignore the culture and morality of others. \n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they believe being gay is a choice or a defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. \n\nWe should listen to experts, not just what our friends and neighbors say.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. I know some people think that because a drug is against the law, it cannot be good. But I do not agree. \n\nIf a drug is good for people, I think it should be available for them. However, making it available to the public is a different question. I do not think it should be available to everyone.\n\nBut, if a doctor says it can help someone, I think it should be used. Just because a drug is against the law does not mean it is bad. Many medicines are against the law, but doctors use them to help people. \n\nFor example, oxycodone and Vicodin are against the law, but they are used in pharmacies because they are helpful. If people think marijuana is bad just because it is against the law, it is not fair. We should think about its good properties.\n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If people drink too much alcohol, it can be bad for them. But if people use marijuana too much, it is not as bad. Maybe we should make marijuana legal, but not all at once. We should help people understand that it is not a bad thing.\n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they might use it responsibly. And it could be helpful for people who are sick.",
            "I think the church has changed to fit modern times. It is not as strict as it was in the past. When I was a child, I went to church every Sunday. I wore a new dress and matching shoes and handbag. It was a special part of my life. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nThe church now has a shorter service on Sundays, only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes and sometimes arrive late. This makes the church feel more relaxed.\n\nI also notice that people wear jeans and khaki pants to morning services. It's a big change from when I wore dresses and skirts. But it's not all bad – khaki pants are nice too.\n\nI don't know much about the church's rules and politics. But I think the church has become more casual.\n\nRegarding the problem of Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't think changing rules would have stopped it. Some men become pedophiles because of their genetics, not because of their choices. Even married men can become pedophiles. It's not because they are allowed to get married or not.\n\nSome religions allow their priests to get married, like Seventh-day Adventists. But even in those cases, some men still become pedophiles. I think it's the person's choice, not their faith, that makes them a pedophile.\n\nI think genetics play a big role in making people become pedophiles. It's not something they choose or learn. It's who they are. You can't change someone's genetics, even with a marriage.\n\nIf the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, that's wrong. But I don't think they always knew. If they did, they should have acted.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic church.",
            "The Iraq war is a very serious issue. I was not happy with the reason we went to war. The 9/11 attacks happened in September. Many people were still upset. I think the Bush administration used the Iraq war as an excuse. They said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but this was not true.\n\nI think the Bush administration lied to the American people. They said Saddam Hussein was connected to Osama Bin Laden. But this was not true. Colin Powell, a high official, said he was not sure of the evidence when he presented it to the UN. This is very bad. It is against the law for a president to lie to the people.\n\nI think the Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution. They have tried to make it weaker since 9/11. They wanted to go to war before they came into office. One of their officials wrote a book saying this. He said the younger Bush wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein because his father was mad at him.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If we leave now, many more people will die. The country may fall into civil war. The UN and the US are trying to find a new way. They want other countries in the area to help restore order. But I am not sure this is a good idea. Iraq will have trouble being a free country if other countries control it.\n\nThe government in Iraq is not working well. The Parliament is not effective. The Prime Minister does not have control.

But I do not think that is a good reason to stay there. It is causing problems for the people of Iraq. \n\nIf we stay in Iraq, we will have to try to build democracy. This takes a long time. If we leave, the Iraqis will be angry with us. They will have to start over again.\n\nI am not sure what to think. I think the war should not be called a war anymore. It was not declared as a war, so it is not a real war. I think we are in Iraq to show our power and to get their oil. \n\nThis is a problem. We are wasting our resources. The person in charge, President Bush, is looking bad because of the war. It is like the Vietnam War, which was also not declared as a war and was not successful.\n\nI know people who have family members in Iraq. Some of these family members are fighting in the war. I want the war to end because many people are suffering. But I also think that if we stay, we will try to change the culture of Iraq. This could make things worse.

            "I don't think it's right for a state to make a law about something that is against a church's rules. The constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control what churches do. It's very clear in the constitution.\n\nIf the government tries to make a law about this, it would go against what is already written in the constitution. This is not right. It would be like the government saying, \"We don't like your church's rules, so we will make a new law to stop you.\"\n\nSome people want to make a law against this, but I think that's not fair. They are choosing one church's rules over another. Many Catholics and Christians do not support this.

If the government makes a law about this, it would be wrong. It would be against what is already written in the constitution.\n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this issue. The president is trying to make a law because of his own personal beliefs. He is showing that he prefers one religion over others. This is not fair.\n\nThere is no good reason for a law against this.

            "The war in Iraq was a difficult and complicated issue. I think the US government was not honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, I believe the government tried to connect the war in Iraq to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. However, this connection was not clear.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq was similar to the Vietnam War. The US government did not learn from past mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government, but the government was not prepared for the consequences. \n\nThe aftermath of the war was chaotic and violent. The US tried to put a democratic government in Iraq, but this was not an easy task. It took years to implement a new form of government. In the US, it took a long time to establish a strong democracy.\n\nThe US government should have been more careful and prepared before invading Iraq. They should have thought about all possible outcomes. The government was not honest with the American people about the war. They made the war seem like a quick and easy victory.\n\nThe US government should not have gone to war without a clear plan. Many American troops are still dying in Iraq. The US is trying to train the Iraqi military and police to control their country. This is a long and difficult process.\n\nThe government made it seem like the war would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. However, this was not true. Implementing a new form of government takes a long time. It was not an easy thing to do in the US, and it will not be easy in Iraq.\n\nThe war in Iraq was a difficult decision. I had mixed feelings about it. In the 2004 presidential election, one of my reasons for voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, I now think that the US should try to leave Iraq, but it is hard because the US took away their government and way of life.\n\nThe US should consider the many American casualties and whether it is worth risking more lives for a free democratic Iraq. If we are invading Iraq to make it a democracy, why not help other countries? The main reason is oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. Another reason for the war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there will be peace. But I do not think this will happen soon.",
            "I support gay marriage. I have always supported it. It is a personal preference. Some people think it may be caused by biology, not by how we are raised.

People who love each other should be able to get married. This is not just a state or government issue, it is a personal issue.\n\nIn my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed to be. But they live like any other family. They walk their dogs like everyone else. I think it is not right for the government to decide what marriage is.\n\nResearch shows that being gay may be caused by something in the brain. People may be born this way. It is not because of how they are raised or their family.\n\nMarriage is a personal thing. If two people want to get married, they should be able to do it quietly, like anyone else. But if gay people want to get married, it becomes a big issue. This is not right.

            "I have a question. I was thinking about the fact that someone went online and saw something. This made a bad thing not happen. The person was on a website called Myspace. If you put information on the internet, it can be seen by many people. On Myspace, you need a friend to see someone's profile. But when you make someone a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information. So, if you put information on the internet, you should expect that many people will see it.\n\nThis is a difficult problem. If someone is watching students' profiles to prevent bad things, it's not fair to just look at certain students. But if someone sees something bad by chance, it's good that they can stop it. It depends on why they were looking at the profile.\n\nI have a Facebook account, but not a Myspace one. I know there are bad people who can see things about me. I saw a story on TV about a man who got information easily from someone's profile. He contacted her on instant messenger and she met him. I would not do that. Some people in my classes know me without knowing my name on the internet. They can find out where I am and who my friends are. It's hard to keep my personal things private.\n\nI limit what I put on the internet, but I also want to communicate with friends. I only accept friends I know. But I'm not sure who can see what.\n\nMy roommate told me about a school that banned Myspace. I don't know if this is a privacy issue. I don't know if the school had the right to tell students they couldn't have Myspace. That's my only other thought.",
            "The Iraq War is a big problem. I want to talk about it. I feel strange saying I was against it from the start. Many people agree it was a bad idea. Most people in the United States, Iraq, and the world think so. \n\nAccording to polls, about 75 to 80 percent of people think the war was a bad idea. In Iraq, 80 percent of people agree. Even 70 percent of US troops in Iraq think it was a mistake. They think the US should leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq is very bad. It was a problem before the US entered. Now, pulling out of Iraq will be difficult too. There is a big cultural difference between the US and countries in the Middle East. The US thinks it can bring democracy to these countries. However, this is not what the people want. Saddam was a bad leader, but you must think carefully before invading a country.\n\nI do not see a good reason for staying in Iraq. I have not heard a good reason to stay longer. If the US wants to leave slowly over time, I would not be against it. But I do not see a reason to stay.\n\nI read that 80 percent of Iraqis want the US to leave within a year. Some Iraqis even want the US to leave now. These are the people we want to help. Maybe they know what is best for them. If we ask them and they say they want us to leave, then we cannot blame them if things get worse.\n\nIf we leave, we can say we tried to help. If we decide to help them after that, we will be seen as good people. Not really, but it will be better than now.",
            "Gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It is not just for women. It also happens in the workplace. The field of work can make a difference. For example, in some jobs, people might think it is hard for a woman to be in charge. This is because society has a long history. In the past, women did not usually hold important positions.\n\nIn many places, people think it is strange for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. This is not always true. Some men want to be at home with their children. But society does not always accept this. People might think, \"Men should work and earn money for their families.\" This can be hard for men who choose to stay at home.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men may not be taken seriously if they like fashion. Some people think men who like fashion are not typical. They might think, \"How can a man know about fashion for women?\" This is a problem because it is not true. Men can know a lot about fashion.\n\nChange is slow. It takes time. But things are getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and getting important jobs. People are starting to accept this. It is also becoming more accepted for men to stay at home and take care of their children. \n\nWe need to promote the qualities of people who are often discriminated against. We should show their good qualities without being too pushy. If we force people to accept change, they might resist. We have made progress, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can be discriminated against based on their job, where they are from, or their gender. For example, someone from a farm might not have good grammar, but they might be very intelligent. They might work their way up to a CEO position. However, other men might think, \"How can I know if you are smart if you don't speak well?\"\n\nIn short, gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It affects women and men in different ways. It also affects people based on their job and where they are from.",
            "My understanding is that they did not make marijuana a crime.  Instead, they made it a minor offense.  You can get a ticket for it, but you will not be arrested.  This is a change from the past when it was a serious crime.\n\nSome people worry about the future problems that come with a marijuana charge, even if it is not a crime.  But there are two sides to this issue.  One side is that it costs a lot of money to arrest and try people for marijuana offenses.  This money could be used for other important things like education and helping the poor.\n\nIn some cities, people are against making marijuana legal because they do not want it to be easily available.  But in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded.  They think making marijuana legal is a good idea because it can bring in money for important programs.\n\nHowever, if marijuana were totally legal, it could be sold in stores like cigarettes.  This might lead to people smoking and driving, which is a problem.  Some people also think it would be uncomfortable to have marijuana out in the open.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol can cause problems.  Marijuana can affect people's lifestyles, and alcohol can affect their driving and decision-making.  Everyone reacts differently to substances, and some people have trouble controlling themselves.\n\nI think it is hard to say what the effects of marijuana will be because people react differently.  But I do think that both marijuana and alcohol have their own problems.",
            "I agree. \n\nBecause I think some things the Catholic Church does are very old. \n\nThey do the same things for a long time. \n\nThis is good. Tradition helps keep us strong. \n\nBut we also need to change with the times. \n\nMany Catholics go to Church every week. \n\nThe Church is strict about rules. \n\nSometimes I think the Church looks down on people who do not follow all the rules. \n\nThe Church does not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \n\nIt also does not accept people from other religions. \n\nFor example, my mom was from a different Christian group and my dad was from another one. \n\nThey could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \n\nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. \n\nCatholics are taught to love others. \n\nBut it is not fair to say we love others and then not accept them. \n\nSo, I think some Catholic teachings and practices do not match. \n\nThe Church is slow to change. \n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop them from hurting children. \n\nSome people who hurt children will do so no matter what. \n\nIt is not fair to compare a spouse to a child. \n\nThese things will probably happen anyway. \n\nTherefore, I do not think allowing priests to marry would be a solution.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I don't know if one side is right or wrong. This is a very difficult problem we face now. It is hard to solve without hurting anyone's feelings. \n\nMarriage and church are two things that are very close together. But we cannot define marriage without offending people. It's hard to decide what marriage is. Should the government decide how to look at marriage? Some people think marriage is a special thing, like a sacrament. If you are married, you get special tax breaks. But if you were baptized, you still get the same tax breaks. \n\nSo, if two people are married, the government should look at it as just a civil union. It's two people who are together. The government should not look at what kind of marriage it was. \n\nGay marriage is another problem. Two people who love each other should be able to have a civil union. \n\nIf all states can agree on this, they should make it a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution is very important. We should not change it for a small issue. \n\nSome people are very passionate about this issue. But it's not big enough to change the constitution. We should not change the constitution to ban gay marriage. \n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes me think about homosexuality in a complex way. I have many gay friends. I don't agree with their lifestyle, but I think it should be legal. I don't think it's a national issue. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are republican. Democratic states usually support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how they feel about this issue. I think you should respect their decision if they choose to legalize gay marriage. You chose to live there, so you should accept their laws.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. This is why I think each state should be able to decide about gay marriage. I already said this, but I want to say it again. I don't think the president should decide for the whole country. President Bush is against gay marriage, but he can't decide for all states. This is because he doesn't live in every state.\n\nI think some things should be decided by each state. If a president changes the law, it will just change back when another president is elected. The states will have to live with their decisions, not the president. If a president lifts the ban on gay marriage in some states, it will not be the same in other states.\n\nI don't agree with President Bush's decision. I think each state should be able to make its own choice about gay marriage.",
            "Myspace is a public place on the Internet. If you put something on it, everyone can see it. This includes school officials. You can't hide it even if you don't use your school name.\n\nWhen you post on the Internet, people will see it. This includes school officials. They can see it from their homes. They may see things that students are not supposed to do. If they see something that can prevent a school shooting, they can take action.\n\nI think school officials can see what students are doing on Myspace. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is their responsibility. They want to make the school a safe place.\n\nSchools have rules to protect students. They practice lock downs in case of emergency. This helps them be prepared for bad things that can happen.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to make sure students are safe. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is good for everyone.\n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy if they look at Myspace to keep students safe. If they see something bad, they can take action. This is their job.\n\nWhen you write something, it can come back to you. This is why you should be careful what you say. If you say something bad, it can hurt you.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to make sure students are not doing bad things. If they see something, they can help. This is good for everyone.\n\nIn my opinion, school officials can look at Myspace to make the school a safer place. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is their job.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I wanted to help. I was affected by the 9/11 attacks. I thought we should go to their country and stop the bad things they did to us.\n\nHowever, I think we did not think about the long-term effects. We did not prepare well and did not have a good plan. This may have led to problems.\n\nNow, I am against the war. I do not think it helped. When countries fight each other, they cannot attack us. If they cannot work together, we cannot change them.\n\nI do not care about what happens in their country. They fight a lot and cannot work together. This makes it hard for us to help them.\n\nWar is different in their country than in ours. They fight in a way that is not civilized. I do not think they want to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were not thinking clearly. We were looking for revenge, not for a good reason. President Bush wanted to declare war on Iraq. I understand why, but we did not have a good plan.\n\nI think we should have helped them in a better way. We did not have unity and did not know what we were doing. A clear plan would have been helpful.\n\nI do not think we can change their country. They will always be like that. We are not making enough progress. We have made some progress, but not enough to stay. If we leave, their country will probably collapse.\n\nWe are hurting ourselves by staying in their country. We cannot stay there forever. I think we should leave and let them solve their own problems."

where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

If you disagree with the Catholic Church's views, you may not want to be part of the church. The Catholic Church does not allow women to be priests or for priests to be married.

            "I think gay marriage should be legal. \n\nThere is no good reason it should not be. \n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. \n\nIt's different. Similar to how two sides of a coin are different but equal. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. Like paying taxes and getting health care. \n\nBut now, if you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or make decisions for you. \n\nThis is not fair. Many studies show that gay couples have the same rates of success as straight couples. They have the same things that make a happy relationship. \n\nIt's just a relationship. The same as any other. \n\nThe problem is that people get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. But gay couples are only asking for a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government allows a civil union, why not a marriage? \n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. \n\nGay couples are the same in many ways. They have the same roles in a relationship. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and how it will affect the community. \n\nThey also worry about children of gay couples. Will they be treated unfairly by their peers and other adults? \n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they get bullied in regular schools. \n\nParents protest to take the child out of school. \n\nThis is not fair to the child. Parenting skills are the same for gay and straight couples. \n\nThe government should help make gay marriage legal in all states. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, based on his religion. But morality is different for everyone. \n\nThe government should not make laws based on one group's morality. It's not fair to ignore the culture and morality of others. \n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they believe being gay is a choice or a defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. \n\nWe should listen to experts, not just what our friends and neighbors say.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. I know some people think that because a drug is against the law, it cannot be good. But I do not agree. \n\nIf a drug is good for people, I think it should be available for them. However, making it available to the public is a different question. I do not think it should be available to everyone.\n\nBut, if a doctor says it can help someone, I think it should be used. Just because a drug is against the law does not mean it is bad. Many medicines are against the law, but doctors use them to help people. \n\nFor example, oxycodone and Vicodin are against the law, but they are used in pharmacies because they are helpful. If people think marijuana is bad just because it is against the law, it is not fair. We should think about its good properties.\n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If people drink too much alcohol, it can be bad for them. But if people use marijuana too much, it is not as bad. Maybe we should make marijuana legal, but not all at once. We should help people understand that it is not a bad thing.\n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they might use it responsibly. And it could be helpful for people who are sick.",
            "I think the church has changed to fit modern times. It is not as strict as it was in the past. When I was a child, I went to church every Sunday. I wore a new dress and matching shoes and handbag. It was a special part of my life. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nThe church now has a shorter service on Sundays, only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes and sometimes arrive late. This makes the church feel more relaxed.\n\nI also notice that people wear jeans and khaki pants to morning services. It's a big change from when I wore dresses and skirts. But it's not all bad – khaki pants are nice too.\n\nI don't know much about the church's rules and politics. But I think the church has become more casual.\n\nRegarding the problem of Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't think changing rules would have stopped it. Some men become pedophiles because of their genetics, not because of their choices. Even married men can become pedophiles. It's not because they are allowed to get married or not.\n\nSome religions allow their priests to get married, like Seventh-day Adventists. But even in those cases, some men still become pedophiles. I think it's the person's choice, not their faith, that makes them a pedophile.\n\nI think genetics play a big role in making people become pedophiles. It's not something they choose or learn. It's who they are. You can't change someone's genetics, even with a marriage.\n\nIf the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, that's wrong. But I don't think they always knew. If they did, they should have acted.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic church.",
            "The Iraq war is a very serious issue. I was not happy with the reason we went to war. The 9/11 attacks happened in September. Many people were still upset. I think the Bush administration used the Iraq war as an excuse. They said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but this was not true.\n\nI think the Bush administration lied to the American people. They said Saddam Hussein was connected to Osama Bin Laden. But this was not true. Colin Powell, a high official, said he was not sure of the evidence when he presented it to the UN. This is very bad. It is against the law for a president to lie to the people.\n\nI think the Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution. They have tried to make it weaker since 9/11. They wanted to go to war before they came into office. One of their officials wrote a book saying this. He said the younger Bush wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein because his father was mad at him.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If we leave now, many more people will die. The country may fall into civil war. The UN and the US are trying to find a new way. They want other countries in the area to help restore order. But I am not sure this is a good idea. Iraq will have trouble being a free country if other countries control it.\n\nThe government in Iraq is not working well. The Parliament is not effective. The Prime Minister does not have control.

But I do not think that is a good reason to stay there. It is causing problems for the people of Iraq. \n\nIf we stay in Iraq, we will have to try to build democracy. This takes a long time. If we leave, the Iraqis will be angry with us. They will have to start over again.\n\nI am not sure what to think. I think the war should not be called a war anymore. It was not declared as a war, so it is not a real war. I think we are in Iraq to show our power and to get their oil. \n\nThis is a problem. We are wasting our resources. The person in charge, President Bush, is looking bad because of the war. It is like the Vietnam War, which was also not declared as a war and was not successful.\n\nI know people who have family members in Iraq. Some of these family members are fighting in the war. I want the war to end because many people are suffering. But I also think that if we stay, we will try to change the culture of Iraq. This could make things worse.

            "I don't think it's right for a state to make a law about something that is against a church's rules. The constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control what churches do. It's very clear in the constitution.\n\nIf the government tries to make a law about this, it would go against what is already written in the constitution. This is not right. It would be like the government saying, \"We don't like your church's rules, so we will make a new law to stop you.\"\n\nSome people want to make a law against this, but I think that's not fair. They are choosing one church's rules over another. Many Catholics and Christians do not support this.

If the government makes a law about this, it would be wrong. It would be against what is already written in the constitution.\n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this issue. The president is trying to make a law because of his own personal beliefs. He is showing that he prefers one religion over others. This is not fair.\n\nThere is no good reason for a law against this.

            "The war in Iraq was a difficult and complicated issue. I think the US government was not honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, I believe the government tried to connect the war in Iraq to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. However, this connection was not clear.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq was similar to the Vietnam War. The US government did not learn from past mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government, but the government was not prepared for the consequences. \n\nThe aftermath of the war was chaotic and violent. The US tried to put a democratic government in Iraq, but this was not an easy task. It took years to implement a new form of government. In the US, it took a long time to establish a strong democracy.\n\nThe US government should have been more careful and prepared before invading Iraq. They should have thought about all possible outcomes. The government was not honest with the American people about the war. They made the war seem like a quick and easy victory.\n\nThe US government should not have gone to war without a clear plan. Many American troops are still dying in Iraq. The US is trying to train the Iraqi military and police to control their country. This is a long and difficult process.\n\nThe government made it seem like the war would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. However, this was not true. Implementing a new form of government takes a long time. It was not an easy thing to do in the US, and it will not be easy in Iraq.\n\nThe war in Iraq was a difficult decision. I had mixed feelings about it. In the 2004 presidential election, one of my reasons for voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, I now think that the US should try to leave Iraq, but it is hard because the US took away their government and way of life.\n\nThe US should consider the many American casualties and whether it is worth risking more lives for a free democratic Iraq. If we are invading Iraq to make it a democracy, why not help other countries? The main reason is oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. Another reason for the war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there will be peace. But I do not think this will happen soon.",
            "I support gay marriage. I have always supported it. It is a personal preference. Some people think it may be caused by biology, not by how we are raised.

People who love each other should be able to get married. This is not just a state or government issue, it is a personal issue.\n\nIn my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed to be. But they live like any other family. They walk their dogs like everyone else. I think it is not right for the government to decide what marriage is.\n\nResearch shows that being gay may be caused by something in the brain. People may be born this way. It is not because of how they are raised or their family.\n\nMarriage is a personal thing. If two people want to get married, they should be able to do it quietly, like anyone else. But if gay people want to get married, it becomes a big issue. This is not right.

            "I have a question. I was thinking about the fact that someone went online and saw something. This made a bad thing not happen. The person was on a website called Myspace. If you put information on the internet, it can be seen by many people. On Myspace, you need a friend to see someone's profile. But when you make someone a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information. So, if you put information on the internet, you should expect that many people will see it.\n\nThis is a difficult problem. If someone is watching students' profiles to prevent bad things, it's not fair to just look at certain students. But if someone sees something bad by chance, it's good that they can stop it. It depends on why they were looking at the profile.\n\nI have a Facebook account, but not a Myspace one. I know there are bad people who can see things about me. I saw a story on TV about a man who got information easily from someone's profile. He contacted her on instant messenger and she met him. I would not do that. Some people in my classes know me without knowing my name on the internet. They can find out where I am and who my friends are. It's hard to keep my personal things private.\n\nI limit what I put on the internet, but I also want to communicate with friends. I only accept friends I know. But I'm not sure who can see what.\n\nMy roommate told me about a school that banned Myspace. I don't know if this is a privacy issue. I don't know if the school had the right to tell students they couldn't have Myspace. That's my only other thought.",
            "The Iraq War is a big problem. I want to talk about it. I feel strange saying I was against it from the start. Many people agree it was a bad idea. Most people in the United States, Iraq, and the world think so. \n\nAccording to polls, about 75 to 80 percent of people think the war was a bad idea. In Iraq, 80 percent of people agree. Even 70 percent of US troops in Iraq think it was a mistake. They think the US should leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq is very bad. It was a problem before the US entered. Now, pulling out of Iraq will be difficult too. There is a big cultural difference between the US and countries in the Middle East. The US thinks it can bring democracy to these countries. However, this is not what the people want. Saddam was a bad leader, but you must think carefully before invading a country.\n\nI do not see a good reason for staying in Iraq. I have not heard a good reason to stay longer. If the US wants to leave slowly over time, I would not be against it. But I do not see a reason to stay.\n\nI read that 80 percent of Iraqis want the US to leave within a year. Some Iraqis even want the US to leave now. These are the people we want to help. Maybe they know what is best for them. If we ask them and they say they want us to leave, then we cannot blame them if things get worse.\n\nIf we leave, we can say we tried to help. If we decide to help them after that, we will be seen as good people. Not really, but it will be better than now.",
            "Gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It is not just for women. It also happens in the workplace. The field of work can make a difference. For example, in some jobs, people might think it is hard for a woman to be in charge. This is because society has a long history. In the past, women did not usually hold important positions.\n\nIn many places, people think it is strange for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. This is not always true. Some men want to be at home with their children. But society does not always accept this. People might think, \"Men should work and earn money for their families.\" This can be hard for men who choose to stay at home.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men may not be taken seriously if they like fashion. Some people think men who like fashion are not typical. They might think, \"How can a man know about fashion for women?\" This is a problem because it is not true. Men can know a lot about fashion.\n\nChange is slow. It takes time. But things are getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and getting important jobs. People are starting to accept this. It is also becoming more accepted for men to stay at home and take care of their children. \n\nWe need to promote the qualities of people who are often discriminated against. We should show their good qualities without being too pushy. If we force people to accept change, they might resist. We have made progress, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can be discriminated against based on their job, where they are from, or their gender. For example, someone from a farm might not have good grammar, but they might be very intelligent. They might work their way up to a CEO position. However, other men might think, \"How can I know if you are smart if you don't speak well?\"\n\nIn short, gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It affects women and men in different ways. It also affects people based on their job and where they are from.",
            "My understanding is that they did not make marijuana a crime.  Instead, they made it a minor offense.  You can get a ticket for it, but you will not be arrested.  This is a change from the past when it was a serious crime.\n\nSome people worry about the future problems that come with a marijuana charge, even if it is not a crime.  But there are two sides to this issue.  One side is that it costs a lot of money to arrest and try people for marijuana offenses.  This money could be used for other important things like education and helping the poor.\n\nIn some cities, people are against making marijuana legal because they do not want it to be easily available.  But in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded.  They think making marijuana legal is a good idea because it can bring in money for important programs.\n\nHowever, if marijuana were totally legal, it could be sold in stores like cigarettes.  This might lead to people smoking and driving, which is a problem.  Some people also think it would be uncomfortable to have marijuana out in the open.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol can cause problems.  Marijuana can affect people's lifestyles, and alcohol can affect their driving and decision-making.  Everyone reacts differently to substances, and some people have trouble controlling themselves.\n\nI think it is hard to say what the effects of marijuana will be because people react differently.  But I do think that both marijuana and alcohol have their own problems.",
            "I agree. \n\nBecause I think some things the Catholic Church does are very old. \n\nThey do the same things for a long time. \n\nThis is good. Tradition helps keep us strong. \n\nBut we also need to change with the times. \n\nMany Catholics go to Church every week. \n\nThe Church is strict about rules. \n\nSometimes I think the Church looks down on people who do not follow all the rules. \n\nThe Church does not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \n\nIt also does not accept people from other religions. \n\nFor example, my mom was from a different Christian group and my dad was from another one. \n\nThey could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \n\nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. \n\nCatholics are taught to love others. \n\nBut it is not fair to say we love others and then not accept them. \n\nSo, I think some Catholic teachings and practices do not match. \n\nThe Church is slow to change. \n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop them from hurting children. \n\nSome people who hurt children will do so no matter what. \n\nIt is not fair to compare a spouse to a child. \n\nThese things will probably happen anyway. \n\nTherefore, I do not think allowing priests to marry would be a solution.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I don't know if one side is right or wrong. This is a very difficult problem we face now. It is hard to solve without hurting anyone's feelings. \n\nMarriage and church are two things that are very close together. But we cannot define marriage without offending people. It's hard to decide what marriage is. Should the government decide how to look at marriage? Some people think marriage is a special thing, like a sacrament. If you are married, you get special tax breaks. But if you were baptized, you still get the same tax breaks. \n\nSo, if two people are married, the government should look at it as just a civil union. It's two people who are together. The government should not look at what kind of marriage it was. \n\nGay marriage is another problem. Two people who love each other should be able to have a civil union. \n\nIf all states can agree on this, they should make it a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution is very important. We should not change it for a small issue. \n\nSome people are very passionate about this issue. But it's not big enough to change the constitution. We should not change the constitution to ban gay marriage. \n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes me think about homosexuality in a complex way. I have many gay friends. I don't agree with their lifestyle, but I think it should be legal. I don't think it's a national issue. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are republican. Democratic states usually support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how they feel about this issue. I think you should respect their decision if they choose to legalize gay marriage. You chose to live there, so you should accept their laws.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. This is why I think each state should be able to decide about gay marriage. I already said this, but I want to say it again. I don't think the president should decide for the whole country. President Bush is against gay marriage, but he can't decide for all states. This is because he doesn't live in every state.\n\nI think some things should be decided by each state. If a president changes the law, it will just change back when another president is elected. The states will have to live with their decisions, not the president. If a president lifts the ban on gay marriage in some states, it will not be the same in other states.\n\nI don't agree with President Bush's decision. I think each state should be able to make its own choice about gay marriage.",
            "Myspace is a public place on the Internet. If you put something on it, everyone can see it. This includes school officials. You can't hide it even if you don't use your school name.\n\nWhen you post on the Internet, people will see it. This includes school officials. They can see it from their homes. They may see things that students are not supposed to do. If they see something that can prevent a school shooting, they can take action.\n\nI think school officials can see what students are doing on Myspace. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is their responsibility. They want to make the school a safe place.\n\nSchools have rules to protect students. They practice lock downs in case of emergency. This helps them be prepared for bad things that can happen.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to make sure students are safe. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is good for everyone.\n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy if they look at Myspace to keep students safe. If they see something bad, they can take action. This is their job.\n\nWhen you write something, it can come back to you. This is why you should be careful what you say. If you say something bad, it can hurt you.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to make sure students are not doing bad things. If they see something, they can help. This is good for everyone.\n\nIn my opinion, school officials can look at Myspace to make the school a safer place. If they see something bad, they can stop it. This is their job.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I wanted to help. I was affected by the 9/11 attacks. I thought we should go to their country and stop the bad things they did to us.\n\nHowever, I think we did not think about the long-term effects. We did not prepare well and did not have a good plan. This may have led to problems.\n\nNow, I am against the war. I do not think it helped. When countries fight each other, they cannot attack us. If they cannot work together, we cannot change them.\n\nI do not care about what happens in their country. They fight a lot and cannot work together. This makes it hard for us to help them.\n\nWar is different in their country than in ours. They fight in a way that is not civilized. I do not think they want to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were not thinking clearly. We were looking for revenge, not for a good reason. President Bush wanted to declare war on Iraq. I understand why, but we did not have a good plan.\n\nI think we should have helped them in a better way. We did not have unity and did not know what we were doing. A clear plan would have been helpful.\n\nI do not think we can change their country. They will always be like that. We are not making enough progress. We have made some progress, but not enough to stay. If we leave, their country will probably collapse.\n\nWe are hurting ourselves by staying in their country. We cannot stay there forever. I think we should leave and let them solve their own problems."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church must make some changes. They have a problem with a lot of people not attending their church. I think this is because the Church is not very accepting of some things. \n\nFor example, they have strong views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views are a little old-fashioned. If the Church adapts to new ideas, they will not lose followers. Some people do not like the Church's views on these subjects. They think the Church is wrong.\n\nIf you are for abortion, you may not want to be part of a Church that says it is wrong. The same is true if you believe in gay marriage. You may not want to be in a Church that does not agree with you.\n\nI do not think it is a good reason that priests cannot be married or that women cannot be priests. Many people have jobs and families. Why can't priests? The Church says priests are married to God, but this is not the same as having a family. I do not see why priests cannot have both.",

Gay people should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nIt's not a choice to be gay or straight. People are born one or the other. My friend is gay. He did not choose to be gay. He is just born that way.\n\nI don't think the federal government should decide who can get married. It's not a matter of national security or morality.

            "I think gay marriage should be made legal. There's no good reason not to. \n\nMany people think homosexual couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. Each couple is different, and their problems are not the same as others. It's like two sides of the same coin – heads and tails are not the same. \n\nGay couples should have the same rights as everyone else. This includes things like paying taxes and getting medical care. If you're in a gay couple and you're sick, your partner can't be with you in the hospital. This is not fair.\n\nI think this is a silly rule. Many scientific studies have shown that gay couples are like straight couples. They have the same kinds of problems and the same kinds of successes. \n\nThe problem is, people get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. But gay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They want a marriage certificate, which is a legal document. \n\nIf a country allows people to have a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how children will be treated. They worry that gay couples will have problems with their community. They worry that children will be influenced by their parents' choices. But we don't know for sure. \n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they get bullied in public schools. This is not fair. Parents who protest to get the child removed from the school are not right. \n\nParenting skills are the same for gay couples as for straight couples. It's about personality, not about being gay or straight.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment against gay marriage is not fair. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, but they are based on his religion. His views on abortion and stem cell research are similar. I don't pay much attention to politics, but it seems that many people's reasons for not allowing gay marriage are based on morality. \n\nBut morality is different for everyone. It's not right to ignore the culture and morality of other people. The government should not make laws that enforce one group's religion on the whole country.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. People should listen to experts, not just their neighbors or friends. \n\nIf people listen to experts, they would see that gay people are not so different. They are just like everyone else.",

If people do not fear using it, they might use it correctly. \n\nMarijuana is not the same as alcohol. If people misuse alcohol, it can cause problems. But marijuana can be used responsibly. \n\nWe should remove the bad image of marijuana. People think it is bad because it is illegal.

It is only thirty minutes long. People wear casual clothes to church, even on Sundays. During the summer, some people wear beach clothes. Families often arrive late.\n\nI think this shows that the church has become more casual. Even on Sundays, people wear jeans and khakis. I think this is a big change.\n\nNow, I want to talk about the problems with Catholic priests and pedophilia. I don't think allowing priests to get married or being female would have prevented these problems. Some married men are still pedophiles. They still have a problem.\n\nWhen someone becomes a priest, it is their choice. They choose to become a priest. Some religions allow their priests to be married. But I think being married or not married does not make someone a pedophile.\n\nI think people are born with certain problems. They cannot choose to be a pedophile. Genetics may play a role in this.

The US went to war in Iraq for reasons that were not honest.\n\nThe Bush administration said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. They said he worked with Osama Bin Laden and caused the 9/11 attacks. But this was not true. They were lying to the American people.\n\nI think this is very bad. The Bush administration did not tell the truth. Even Colin Powell did not believe in the evidence. He said this after giving a big speech at the UN. He said he was not sure of the evidence at the time.\n\nThis is wrong. It is against the law for government officials to lie to the people. They did not respect the US Constitution. They did this since 9/11.\n\nThe Bush administration wanted to go to war. They planned it before they came into office. The Secretary of the Treasury said this in a book. He said the younger Bush wanted to go to war because of his father's past problems with Saddam Hussein. He also wanted to control Iraq's oil.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If the US leaves now, there could be a big problem. The country might fall apart and many more people would die. The US and the UN want to have other countries from the area help keep order in Iraq. But I am not sure this is a good idea. It could cause more problems in the long run.\n\nIraq will have trouble being in charge of itself. The government is not working well now.

I think this war started because the United States was angry after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. We thought Iraq was involved.\n\nI'm not very informed about this war. I don't know many details. But I think our goal is to help Iraq become a democracy like the United States. We also want their oil.\n\nStaying in Iraq makes people unhappy. If we stay, we have to build democracy, which takes a long time. If we leave, Iraq will be unhappy with us.\n\nI think this is a difficult decision. I don't know what to do. Do we stay and help Iraq? Or do we go home and let them start again?\n\nI'm not sure. I have many thoughts. One thing is clear: it's not fair to stay in Iraq forever. We should not call it a war because it was not officially declared.\n\nWe use guns to show our power. But is this the right reason to stay? I don't think so.\n\nI feel bad for President Bush. He's getting a bad name because of this war. It reminds me of the Vietnam War. That was an undeclared war and it didn't work out well.\n\nI have friends whose family members are in Iraq. I feel bad for them. But if we stay, we might be changing Iraq too much. They have their own culture, and we might make things worse.\n\nWe might be creating a bigger problem with Al-Kaida.

It allows for freedom of religion. Making a law about this would be wrong and go against what is already written in the Constitution.\n\nI think the government should not be involved in this issue.

            "There is much disagreement about the war in Iraq. I do not think the government was honest about the reasons for fighting. They said the war was connected to the attacks on September 11th. But this was not true. The government used this to get the support of the American people.\n\nI am against war. I do not think a preemptive attack is ever a good idea. The war in Iraq was like the war in Vietnam. The US government did not learn from its past mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government, but it was not prepared for the problems that followed.\n\nThe US tried to put a new government in Iraq. But this was not easy. It is always a long process to set up a new government. The US government made it seem easy, but it was not. Democracy is not an easy thing to create.\n\nIt is hard to make a decision about the war in Iraq. I have mixed feelings about it. In the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. He said he would finish what he started. But then I thought, how can we leave Iraq? We took away their government and their way of life. We must see it through, but at what cost? Many American soldiers have died.\n\nThe main reason for the war in Iraq was oil. The US wanted control of the oil. Another reason was that Iraq was said to have weapons of mass destruction. But no such weapons were found. We knew North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not attack them. This shows that the US government is not honest about its reasons for war.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But this is not likely.",

The internet is public, and everyone sees it.\n\nIf you are friends with someone on a website like MySpace, you will see what they post. But the school did not post the information.

It was to help another country gain democracy. \nBut now, I think we are fighting for other reasons. \nWe want to show the world that we are a strong country. \nI am not sure this is a good reason for war. \n\nI think the reason for the war was questionable from the start. \nGeorge Bush's father had problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf we wanted to help a country without a fair government, that would be a good reason. \nBut if there were personal reasons, it would not be fair. \n\nI think we made a point when we started the war. \nIt was a strong statement. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nThis is not good. \n\nIf we wanted to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that would be a good reason for war. \nBut I do not think our reason has been clear for a long time. \nWe seem to be fighting just to fight. \nWe do not want to end the war without winning. \n\nI think the war has lasted long enough. \nThe government of the other country should take care of itself. \nWe should not spend a lot of money on war. \nWe have our own problems to solve, like poverty and bad roads. \nWe need to spend money on these things. \n\nWe are spending a lot of money on war. \nIt is not good to spend a lot of money on war for a long time. \nWe should spend money on things that help our own people, like health care and education. \nNow, we are spending money to hurt our own people in a war we are losing. \n\nThis is my opinion.",
            "I have a question to ask for clarification.\n\nSomeone was able to stop something bad from happening because they found information on the internet. This person looked at Myspace, a website where people can share information. They found something that could have prevented a life from being lost.\n\nIt is true that information on the internet is open to many people. If you post something on Myspace, many people can see it. You must add someone as a friend for them to see your profile, but that means you have given them permission.\n\nWhen you put information on the internet, you must understand that many people will see it. I think it is good that someone saw the information and was able to stop something bad from happening.\n\nHowever, it is a problem to have one person watching all the students' profiles all the time. It is not fair to judge people based on what they post on the internet. It is not right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles all the time.\n\nIt depends on why someone looked at the profile. Were they looking for something important or just looking at people's profiles randomly?\n\nI have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people who can see things about me. I know that it is possible for people to get information easily. I saw a TV show about a man who got a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger. He got her to meet him in less than a minute.\n\nIt is hard to know who can see your information on the internet. You can limit what you put on the internet, but it is hard to make sure that only people you know can see it. The point of having a profile is to be able to communicate with friends.\n\nMy roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I am not sure how the school officials had the right to do that.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I know it's not easy for me to say this, but I was against it at first. Many people were. But now, it's not important to say I was against it from the start. The majority of people think it was a bad idea. \n\nIn the United States, Iraq, and all around the world, most people think the war was a mistake. About 75-80% of the world's population thinks so. In Iraq, 80% of the people think it was a bad idea. Even 70% of the U.S. troops in Iraq think the war was a mistake and want to leave within a year.\n\nThe war has been a disaster from the beginning. It's hard to fix things now. The problem is that the United States and Middle Eastern countries have very different cultures. It's hard for us to understand their way of life and bring democracy to their countries. We should consider what the people of Iraq really want, not just what our government thinks is best.\n\nSaddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought carefully before invading his country. We need to weigh the good and bad before making big decisions like that. We can see that the war has caused big problems and made things worse.\n\nI don't think our government has a good reason to stay in Iraq. We should leave now. If we leave slowly, it's okay, but I don't see a reason to stay any longer. Most Iraqis want us to leave, and they know what's best for their country. If we listen to them, it won't be our fault if things go badly. We can still help them after we leave, and it will be better for everyone.",
            "There is still a problem with women and men being treated unfairly in the United States. This is called gender discrimination.\n\nPeople are not equal everywhere. It depends on the job. Women often have a harder time. This is because society has a long history of men being in charge. Even when there is a law that says everyone is equal, it's hard to make it happen.\n\nImagine a glass ceiling that women can't break through. They have the skills and education to do a job, but they don't get the chance to do it. This happens when men are not used to working for women.\n\nIt's the same for men who stay at home with their children. Society doesn't understand this. They think men should be the ones earning money. If a man stays home, people might think he's not doing his job.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who like fashion are not always taken seriously. People think they don't know about fashion because of their style. But this is not true.\n\nChanging society is slow. We have come a long way, but we have a long way to go. We need to show people that women and men can do different things and be good at them. We can do this by talking about the good things people do, not by forcing people to accept them.\n\nIt's good that we're making progress, but we need to be careful. If we do things too fast, people might resist. We need to find a balance.\n\nPeople can be discriminated against because of where they're from or their job. If someone talks differently, they might be judged by others. This is not fair.\n\nIn conclusion, gender discrimination is a problem in the United States. We need to work together to make things more equal. We can do this by being kind and understanding, and by showing people that everyone can be good at different things.",
            "My understanding is that some places did not make marijuana a crime.  They made it a smaller problem, like a traffic ticket.  You get a fine, not arrested and taken to jail.  This makes some people happy.  But some people worry about the future.  They think a marijuana charge can still cause problems, even if it is not a crime.\n\nSome people say it costs too much money to arrest and try people for marijuana.  It costs money to take them to court and pay for lawyers.  So, some cities do not want to make marijuana a smaller problem.  They do not want to spend the money.\n\nBut some cities are okay with making marijuana a smaller problem.  Denver is one example.  People in Denver tend to be more open-minded.  This city now has more money to spend on important things like schools, food for the homeless, and help for the elderly.\n\nIt is a good idea to make marijuana a smaller problem.  But it is also true that marijuana can be a problem.  If people can buy it anywhere, they might smoke it while driving.  Smoking marijuana is not accepted in many places.  Some people do not want to see it everywhere.\n\nAlcohol can also cause problems.  It can affect how people drive and make decisions.  Marijuana can affect how people live their lives.  People react to substances differently.  Some people can use them without problems, but others cannot.\n\nSo, it is hard to say what to do about marijuana.  But it is true that both marijuana and alcohol can cause problems.  We need to be careful and think about how to use them.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nTraditional things are very important. \nThey have been done this way for a long time. \nIt is good to be connected to the past. \nBut it is also important to be able to change. \nI think this is true. \n\nMany Catholics go to church every week. \nThey do things a certain way. \nI feel that the Catholic Church does not accept people who do not follow its rules very well. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \nThis happened to my parents. \nMy mom was a Catholic and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThey could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \n\nThe Catholic Church teaches us to love others. \nBut it does not practice what it preaches. \nThis is because some of its old rules are not good. \nThe Church keeps these rules anyway. \n\nI do not think that allowing priests to marry would make a difference. \nSome people who do bad things will do them anyway. \nThey will hurt children, no matter if they are married or not. \nThis is a big problem. \n\nWe should focus on stopping people from hurting children. \nAllowing priests to marry will not solve this problem. \nWe need to find other ways to stop this from happening.",
            "I'm not sure about this issue yet.  \nI don't know if one side is right or wrong.  \nThis is a very difficult problem we face now.  \nIt's hard to decide when the line between church and state is unclear.  \nAlso, defining marriage is a very hard job because it can offend people.  \n\nI don't know if marriage should be decided by the government.  \nSome people think it's a special ceremony, like a sacrament.  \nIf that's true, then people in a marriage could get tax breaks.  \nOr they could get special treatment from the government because they were baptized.  \nBut I think the government should just look at marriage as a civil union.  \nIt's a union between two people, and that's all.  \n\nThey shouldn't ask what kind of marriage it is or what church the couple belongs to.  \nIt's just two people who are together.  \nThe issue of gay marriage is similar.  \nIt's just two people who are in a union.  \n\nIf all the states can agree on this, then they should make it a federal law.  \nBut making a constitutional amendment to stop gay marriage is not right.  \nThe constitution should not be changed just because many people don't like it.  \nIt's not important enough to change the constitution over.  \nWe just need to accept that marriage is between two people who love each other.  \n\nNo, I don't think the constitution should be changed for this reason.",
            "I grew up in a Christian family. For me, homosexuality is a complicated issue. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with all parts of the gay lifestyle. But I think it should be legal. I do not think it is a national problem. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are Republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how the state feels about this issue. I do not think you can disagree with a state's decision if it decides to allow gay marriage. You chose to live there.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. So, each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already said this. I do not think the president should decide what is best for every state. George Bush does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state runs itself.\n\nSome things should be decided by each state. George Bush will not be president for much longer. If a new president wants to allow gay marriage, the law might change. But that is not necessary. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nNo, I do not agree with that. I think each state should make its own decision about gay marriage.",
            "I think school officials have the right to see what students are posting on the internet. Myspace is a public place where people share things for everyone to see. If you post something on the internet, you have to be ready for anyone to see it, including school officials.\n\nEven if you don't put the school's name on it, they can still find it if they want to. They can use their computers at home to look for it. The school officials' job is to keep students safe. If they find something that can help them do this, I think it's okay for them to look at it.\n\nFor example, if they go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking, I think that's okay. It's their job to keep the school safe and make sure students are not breaking the rules.\n\nBut if they just go on the internet to catch students and get them in trouble, I think that's not right. It's an invasion of privacy. However, if they find something that helps them keep the school safe, I think it's okay.\n\nSome people might think it's not right for school officials to look at what students are posting on the internet. But I think it's okay as long as it helps keep the school safe. We had lock-down drills in my school to prepare for emergencies. It's like the school officials are doing the same thing, trying to keep the school safe.\n\nThey are not trying to catch students; they are trying to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting. We had a shooting at Columbine High School, and it was very sad. So, I think school officials are doing the right thing by looking at what students are posting on the internet.\n\nWe have to be careful about what we post on the internet because it can come back and hurt us. It's like a big record of everything we do. If we say or do something bad when we're a student, it can come back and cause problems when we're older. It's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nSo, I think school officials are okay to look at what students are posting on the internet if it helps them keep the school safe. But they should not just look for ways to catch students. They should look for ways to help the school and keep everyone safe.",
            "I want to talk about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea. I was personally affected by 9/11. I wanted to go to that country and make them feel what we felt after 9/11.\n\nHowever, I think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term effects of our actions. We went to war without a plan. This was a big mistake.\n\nI was for the war at first, but now I am against it. I don't think it helped. The people in that country are fighting with each other. They can't fight with us if they can't even get along with themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 changed my feelings about that country. I don't care what happens there anymore. I think they are not very nice people when it comes to war. They just want to fight. They don't want to make their country better.\n\nI think we went to war for revenge, not a good reason. We were angry and wanted to fight back. We didn't think about what could happen. President Bush decided to go to war with Iraq. I understand why he did it, but I think we should have had a better plan.\n\nWe didn't have unity and clarity about what we wanted to do in that country. We didn't think about how to create order. I think this would have helped us a lot.\n\nI don't think we can change those people. They will always be the same. We are not helping them by staying there. We are just hurting ourselves. We can't stay in that country forever. When we leave, it will collapse. I think we should leave now."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church must make some changes. They have a problem with a lot of people not attending their church. I think this is because the Church is not very accepting of some things. \n\nFor example, they have strong views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views are a little old-fashioned. If the Church adapts to new ideas, they will not lose followers. Some people do not like the Church's views on these subjects. They think the Church is wrong.\n\nIf you are for abortion, you may not want to be part of a Church that says it is wrong. The same is true if you believe in gay marriage. You may not want to be in a Church that does not agree with you.\n\nI do not think it is a good reason that priests cannot be married or that women cannot be priests. Many people have jobs and families. Why can't priests? The Church says priests are married to God, but this is not the same as having a family. I do not see why priests cannot have both.",

Gay people should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nIt's not a choice to be gay or straight. People are born one or the other. My friend is gay. He did not choose to be gay. He is just born that way.\n\nI don't think the federal government should decide who can get married. It's not a matter of national security or morality.

            "I think gay marriage should be made legal. There's no good reason not to. \n\nMany people think homosexual couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. Each couple is different, and their problems are not the same as others. It's like two sides of the same coin – heads and tails are not the same. \n\nGay couples should have the same rights as everyone else. This includes things like paying taxes and getting medical care. If you're in a gay couple and you're sick, your partner can't be with you in the hospital. This is not fair.\n\nI think this is a silly rule. Many scientific studies have shown that gay couples are like straight couples. They have the same kinds of problems and the same kinds of successes. \n\nThe problem is, people get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. But gay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They want a marriage certificate, which is a legal document. \n\nIf a country allows people to have a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how children will be treated. They worry that gay couples will have problems with their community. They worry that children will be influenced by their parents' choices. But we don't know for sure. \n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they get bullied in public schools. This is not fair. Parents who protest to get the child removed from the school are not right. \n\nParenting skills are the same for gay couples as for straight couples. It's about personality, not about being gay or straight.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment against gay marriage is not fair. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, but they are based on his religion. His views on abortion and stem cell research are similar. I don't pay much attention to politics, but it seems that many people's reasons for not allowing gay marriage are based on morality. \n\nBut morality is different for everyone. It's not right to ignore the culture and morality of other people. The government should not make laws that enforce one group's religion on the whole country.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. People should listen to experts, not just their neighbors or friends. \n\nIf people listen to experts, they would see that gay people are not so different. They are just like everyone else.",

If people do not fear using it, they might use it correctly. \n\nMarijuana is not the same as alcohol. If people misuse alcohol, it can cause problems. But marijuana can be used responsibly. \n\nWe should remove the bad image of marijuana. People think it is bad because it is illegal.

It is only thirty minutes long. People wear casual clothes to church, even on Sundays. During the summer, some people wear beach clothes. Families often arrive late.\n\nI think this shows that the church has become more casual. Even on Sundays, people wear jeans and khakis. I think this is a big change.\n\nNow, I want to talk about the problems with Catholic priests and pedophilia. I don't think allowing priests to get married or being female would have prevented these problems. Some married men are still pedophiles. They still have a problem.\n\nWhen someone becomes a priest, it is their choice. They choose to become a priest. Some religions allow their priests to be married. But I think being married or not married does not make someone a pedophile.\n\nI think people are born with certain problems. They cannot choose to be a pedophile. Genetics may play a role in this.

The US went to war in Iraq for reasons that were not honest.\n\nThe Bush administration said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. They said he worked with Osama Bin Laden and caused the 9/11 attacks. But this was not true. They were lying to the American people.\n\nI think this is very bad. The Bush administration did not tell the truth. Even Colin Powell did not believe in the evidence. He said this after giving a big speech at the UN. He said he was not sure of the evidence at the time.\n\nThis is wrong. It is against the law for government officials to lie to the people. They did not respect the US Constitution. They did this since 9/11.\n\nThe Bush administration wanted to go to war. They planned it before they came into office. The Secretary of the Treasury said this in a book. He said the younger Bush wanted to go to war because of his father's past problems with Saddam Hussein. He also wanted to control Iraq's oil.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If the US leaves now, there could be a big problem. The country might fall apart and many more people would die. The US and the UN want to have other countries from the area help keep order in Iraq. But I am not sure this is a good idea. It could cause more problems in the long run.\n\nIraq will have trouble being in charge of itself. The government is not working well now.

I think this war started because the United States was angry after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. We thought Iraq was involved.\n\nI'm not very informed about this war. I don't know many details. But I think our goal is to help Iraq become a democracy like the United States. We also want their oil.\n\nStaying in Iraq makes people unhappy. If we stay, we have to build democracy, which takes a long time. If we leave, Iraq will be unhappy with us.\n\nI think this is a difficult decision. I don't know what to do. Do we stay and help Iraq? Or do we go home and let them start again?\n\nI'm not sure. I have many thoughts. One thing is clear: it's not fair to stay in Iraq forever. We should not call it a war because it was not officially declared.\n\nWe use guns to show our power. But is this the right reason to stay? I don't think so.\n\nI feel bad for President Bush. He's getting a bad name because of this war. It reminds me of the Vietnam War. That was an undeclared war and it didn't work out well.\n\nI have friends whose family members are in Iraq. I feel bad for them. But if we stay, we might be changing Iraq too much. They have their own culture, and we might make things worse.\n\nWe might be creating a bigger problem with Al-Kaida.

It allows for freedom of religion. Making a law about this would be wrong and go against what is already written in the Constitution.\n\nI think the government should not be involved in this issue.

            "There is much disagreement about the war in Iraq. I do not think the government was honest about the reasons for fighting. They said the war was connected to the attacks on September 11th. But this was not true. The government used this to get the support of the American people.\n\nI am against war. I do not think a preemptive attack is ever a good idea. The war in Iraq was like the war in Vietnam. The US government did not learn from its past mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government, but it was not prepared for the problems that followed.\n\nThe US tried to put a new government in Iraq. But this was not easy. It is always a long process to set up a new government. The US government made it seem easy, but it was not. Democracy is not an easy thing to create.\n\nIt is hard to make a decision about the war in Iraq. I have mixed feelings about it. In the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. He said he would finish what he started. But then I thought, how can we leave Iraq? We took away their government and their way of life. We must see it through, but at what cost? Many American soldiers have died.\n\nThe main reason for the war in Iraq was oil. The US wanted control of the oil. Another reason was that Iraq was said to have weapons of mass destruction. But no such weapons were found. We knew North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not attack them. This shows that the US government is not honest about its reasons for war.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But this is not likely.",

The internet is public, and everyone sees it.\n\nIf you are friends with someone on a website like MySpace, you will see what they post. But the school did not post the information.

It was to help another country gain democracy. \nBut now, I think we are fighting for other reasons. \nWe want to show the world that we are a strong country. \nI am not sure this is a good reason for war. \n\nI think the reason for the war was questionable from the start. \nGeorge Bush's father had problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf we wanted to help a country without a fair government, that would be a good reason. \nBut if there were personal reasons, it would not be fair. \n\nI think we made a point when we started the war. \nIt was a strong statement. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nThis is not good. \n\nIf we wanted to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that would be a good reason for war. \nBut I do not think our reason has been clear for a long time. \nWe seem to be fighting just to fight. \nWe do not want to end the war without winning. \n\nI think the war has lasted long enough. \nThe government of the other country should take care of itself. \nWe should not spend a lot of money on war. \nWe have our own problems to solve, like poverty and bad roads. \nWe need to spend money on these things. \n\nWe are spending a lot of money on war. \nIt is not good to spend a lot of money on war for a long time. \nWe should spend money on things that help our own people, like health care and education. \nNow, we are spending money to hurt our own people in a war we are losing. \n\nThis is my opinion.",
            "I have a question to ask for clarification.\n\nSomeone was able to stop something bad from happening because they found information on the internet. This person looked at Myspace, a website where people can share information. They found something that could have prevented a life from being lost.\n\nIt is true that information on the internet is open to many people. If you post something on Myspace, many people can see it. You must add someone as a friend for them to see your profile, but that means you have given them permission.\n\nWhen you put information on the internet, you must understand that many people will see it. I think it is good that someone saw the information and was able to stop something bad from happening.\n\nHowever, it is a problem to have one person watching all the students' profiles all the time. It is not fair to judge people based on what they post on the internet. It is not right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles all the time.\n\nIt depends on why someone looked at the profile. Were they looking for something important or just looking at people's profiles randomly?\n\nI have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people who can see things about me. I know that it is possible for people to get information easily. I saw a TV show about a man who got a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger. He got her to meet him in less than a minute.\n\nIt is hard to know who can see your information on the internet. You can limit what you put on the internet, but it is hard to make sure that only people you know can see it. The point of having a profile is to be able to communicate with friends.\n\nMy roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I am not sure how the school officials had the right to do that.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I know it's not easy for me to say this, but I was against it at first. Many people were. But now, it's not important to say I was against it from the start. The majority of people think it was a bad idea. \n\nIn the United States, Iraq, and all around the world, most people think the war was a mistake. About 75-80% of the world's population thinks so. In Iraq, 80% of the people think it was a bad idea. Even 70% of the U.S. troops in Iraq think the war was a mistake and want to leave within a year.\n\nThe war has been a disaster from the beginning. It's hard to fix things now. The problem is that the United States and Middle Eastern countries have very different cultures. It's hard for us to understand their way of life and bring democracy to their countries. We should consider what the people of Iraq really want, not just what our government thinks is best.\n\nSaddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought carefully before invading his country. We need to weigh the good and bad before making big decisions like that. We can see that the war has caused big problems and made things worse.\n\nI don't think our government has a good reason to stay in Iraq. We should leave now. If we leave slowly, it's okay, but I don't see a reason to stay any longer. Most Iraqis want us to leave, and they know what's best for their country. If we listen to them, it won't be our fault if things go badly. We can still help them after we leave, and it will be better for everyone.",
            "There is still a problem with women and men being treated unfairly in the United States. This is called gender discrimination.\n\nPeople are not equal everywhere. It depends on the job. Women often have a harder time. This is because society has a long history of men being in charge. Even when there is a law that says everyone is equal, it's hard to make it happen.\n\nImagine a glass ceiling that women can't break through. They have the skills and education to do a job, but they don't get the chance to do it. This happens when men are not used to working for women.\n\nIt's the same for men who stay at home with their children. Society doesn't understand this. They think men should be the ones earning money. If a man stays home, people might think he's not doing his job.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who like fashion are not always taken seriously. People think they don't know about fashion because of their style. But this is not true.\n\nChanging society is slow. We have come a long way, but we have a long way to go. We need to show people that women and men can do different things and be good at them. We can do this by talking about the good things people do, not by forcing people to accept them.\n\nIt's good that we're making progress, but we need to be careful. If we do things too fast, people might resist. We need to find a balance.\n\nPeople can be discriminated against because of where they're from or their job. If someone talks differently, they might be judged by others. This is not fair.\n\nIn conclusion, gender discrimination is a problem in the United States. We need to work together to make things more equal. We can do this by being kind and understanding, and by showing people that everyone can be good at different things.",
            "My understanding is that some places did not make marijuana a crime.  They made it a smaller problem, like a traffic ticket.  You get a fine, not arrested and taken to jail.  This makes some people happy.  But some people worry about the future.  They think a marijuana charge can still cause problems, even if it is not a crime.\n\nSome people say it costs too much money to arrest and try people for marijuana.  It costs money to take them to court and pay for lawyers.  So, some cities do not want to make marijuana a smaller problem.  They do not want to spend the money.\n\nBut some cities are okay with making marijuana a smaller problem.  Denver is one example.  People in Denver tend to be more open-minded.  This city now has more money to spend on important things like schools, food for the homeless, and help for the elderly.\n\nIt is a good idea to make marijuana a smaller problem.  But it is also true that marijuana can be a problem.  If people can buy it anywhere, they might smoke it while driving.  Smoking marijuana is not accepted in many places.  Some people do not want to see it everywhere.\n\nAlcohol can also cause problems.  It can affect how people drive and make decisions.  Marijuana can affect how people live their lives.  People react to substances differently.  Some people can use them without problems, but others cannot.\n\nSo, it is hard to say what to do about marijuana.  But it is true that both marijuana and alcohol can cause problems.  We need to be careful and think about how to use them.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nTraditional things are very important. \nThey have been done this way for a long time. \nIt is good to be connected to the past. \nBut it is also important to be able to change. \nI think this is true. \n\nMany Catholics go to church every week. \nThey do things a certain way. \nI feel that the Catholic Church does not accept people who do not follow its rules very well. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \nThis happened to my parents. \nMy mom was a Catholic and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThey could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \n\nThe Catholic Church teaches us to love others. \nBut it does not practice what it preaches. \nThis is because some of its old rules are not good. \nThe Church keeps these rules anyway. \n\nI do not think that allowing priests to marry would make a difference. \nSome people who do bad things will do them anyway. \nThey will hurt children, no matter if they are married or not. \nThis is a big problem. \n\nWe should focus on stopping people from hurting children. \nAllowing priests to marry will not solve this problem. \nWe need to find other ways to stop this from happening.",
            "I'm not sure about this issue yet.  \nI don't know if one side is right or wrong.  \nThis is a very difficult problem we face now.  \nIt's hard to decide when the line between church and state is unclear.  \nAlso, defining marriage is a very hard job because it can offend people.  \n\nI don't know if marriage should be decided by the government.  \nSome people think it's a special ceremony, like a sacrament.  \nIf that's true, then people in a marriage could get tax breaks.  \nOr they could get special treatment from the government because they were baptized.  \nBut I think the government should just look at marriage as a civil union.  \nIt's a union between two people, and that's all.  \n\nThey shouldn't ask what kind of marriage it is or what church the couple belongs to.  \nIt's just two people who are together.  \nThe issue of gay marriage is similar.  \nIt's just two people who are in a union.  \n\nIf all the states can agree on this, then they should make it a federal law.  \nBut making a constitutional amendment to stop gay marriage is not right.  \nThe constitution should not be changed just because many people don't like it.  \nIt's not important enough to change the constitution over.  \nWe just need to accept that marriage is between two people who love each other.  \n\nNo, I don't think the constitution should be changed for this reason.",
            "I grew up in a Christian family. For me, homosexuality is a complicated issue. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with all parts of the gay lifestyle. But I think it should be legal. I do not think it is a national problem. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are Republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how the state feels about this issue. I do not think you can disagree with a state's decision if it decides to allow gay marriage. You chose to live there.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. So, each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already said this. I do not think the president should decide what is best for every state. George Bush does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state runs itself.\n\nSome things should be decided by each state. George Bush will not be president for much longer. If a new president wants to allow gay marriage, the law might change. But that is not necessary. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nNo, I do not agree with that. I think each state should make its own decision about gay marriage.",
            "I think school officials have the right to see what students are posting on the internet. Myspace is a public place where people share things for everyone to see. If you post something on the internet, you have to be ready for anyone to see it, including school officials.\n\nEven if you don't put the school's name on it, they can still find it if they want to. They can use their computers at home to look for it. The school officials' job is to keep students safe. If they find something that can help them do this, I think it's okay for them to look at it.\n\nFor example, if they go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking, I think that's okay. It's their job to keep the school safe and make sure students are not breaking the rules.\n\nBut if they just go on the internet to catch students and get them in trouble, I think that's not right. It's an invasion of privacy. However, if they find something that helps them keep the school safe, I think it's okay.\n\nSome people might think it's not right for school officials to look at what students are posting on the internet. But I think it's okay as long as it helps keep the school safe. We had lock-down drills in my school to prepare for emergencies. It's like the school officials are doing the same thing, trying to keep the school safe.\n\nThey are not trying to catch students; they are trying to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting. We had a shooting at Columbine High School, and it was very sad. So, I think school officials are doing the right thing by looking at what students are posting on the internet.\n\nWe have to be careful about what we post on the internet because it can come back and hurt us. It's like a big record of everything we do. If we say or do something bad when we're a student, it can come back and cause problems when we're older. It's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nSo, I think school officials are okay to look at what students are posting on the internet if it helps them keep the school safe. But they should not just look for ways to catch students. They should look for ways to help the school and keep everyone safe.",
            "I want to talk about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea. I was personally affected by 9/11. I wanted to go to that country and make them feel what we felt after 9/11.\n\nHowever, I think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term effects of our actions. We went to war without a plan. This was a big mistake.\n\nI was for the war at first, but now I am against it. I don't think it helped. The people in that country are fighting with each other. They can't fight with us if they can't even get along with themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 changed my feelings about that country. I don't care what happens there anymore. I think they are not very nice people when it comes to war. They just want to fight. They don't want to make their country better.\n\nI think we went to war for revenge, not a good reason. We were angry and wanted to fight back. We didn't think about what could happen. President Bush decided to go to war with Iraq. I understand why he did it, but I think we should have had a better plan.\n\nWe didn't have unity and clarity about what we wanted to do in that country. We didn't think about how to create order. I think this would have helped us a lot.\n\nI don't think we can change those people. They will always be the same. We are not helping them by staying there. We are just hurting ourselves. We can't stay in that country forever. When we leave, it will collapse. I think we should leave now."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church must make some changes. They have a problem with a lot of people not attending their church. I think this is because the Church is not very accepting of some things. \n\nFor example, they have strong views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views are a little old-fashioned. If the Church adapts to new ideas, they will not lose followers. Some people do not like the Church's views on these subjects. They think the Church is wrong.\n\nIf you are for abortion, you may not want to be part of a Church that says it is wrong. The same is true if you believe in gay marriage. You may not want to be in a Church that does not agree with you.\n\nI do not think it is a good reason that priests cannot be married or that women cannot be priests. Many people have jobs and families. Why can't priests? The Church says priests are married to God, but this is not the same as having a family. I do not see why priests cannot have both.",

Gay people should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nIt's not a choice to be gay or straight. People are born one or the other. My friend is gay. He did not choose to be gay. He is just born that way.\n\nI don't think the federal government should decide who can get married. It's not a matter of national security or morality.

            "I think gay marriage should be made legal. There's no good reason not to. \n\nMany people think homosexual couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. Each couple is different, and their problems are not the same as others. It's like two sides of the same coin – heads and tails are not the same. \n\nGay couples should have the same rights as everyone else. This includes things like paying taxes and getting medical care. If you're in a gay couple and you're sick, your partner can't be with you in the hospital. This is not fair.\n\nI think this is a silly rule. Many scientific studies have shown that gay couples are like straight couples. They have the same kinds of problems and the same kinds of successes. \n\nThe problem is, people get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. But gay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They want a marriage certificate, which is a legal document. \n\nIf a country allows people to have a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how children will be treated. They worry that gay couples will have problems with their community. They worry that children will be influenced by their parents' choices. But we don't know for sure. \n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they get bullied in public schools. This is not fair. Parents who protest to get the child removed from the school are not right. \n\nParenting skills are the same for gay couples as for straight couples. It's about personality, not about being gay or straight.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment against gay marriage is not fair. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, but they are based on his religion. His views on abortion and stem cell research are similar. I don't pay much attention to politics, but it seems that many people's reasons for not allowing gay marriage are based on morality. \n\nBut morality is different for everyone. It's not right to ignore the culture and morality of other people. The government should not make laws that enforce one group's religion on the whole country.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. People should listen to experts, not just their neighbors or friends. \n\nIf people listen to experts, they would see that gay people are not so different. They are just like everyone else.",

If people do not fear using it, they might use it correctly. \n\nMarijuana is not the same as alcohol. If people misuse alcohol, it can cause problems. But marijuana can be used responsibly. \n\nWe should remove the bad image of marijuana. People think it is bad because it is illegal.

It is only thirty minutes long. People wear casual clothes to church, even on Sundays. During the summer, some people wear beach clothes. Families often arrive late.\n\nI think this shows that the church has become more casual. Even on Sundays, people wear jeans and khakis. I think this is a big change.\n\nNow, I want to talk about the problems with Catholic priests and pedophilia. I don't think allowing priests to get married or being female would have prevented these problems. Some married men are still pedophiles. They still have a problem.\n\nWhen someone becomes a priest, it is their choice. They choose to become a priest. Some religions allow their priests to be married. But I think being married or not married does not make someone a pedophile.\n\nI think people are born with certain problems. They cannot choose to be a pedophile. Genetics may play a role in this.

The US went to war in Iraq for reasons that were not honest.\n\nThe Bush administration said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. They said he worked with Osama Bin Laden and caused the 9/11 attacks. But this was not true. They were lying to the American people.\n\nI think this is very bad. The Bush administration did not tell the truth. Even Colin Powell did not believe in the evidence. He said this after giving a big speech at the UN. He said he was not sure of the evidence at the time.\n\nThis is wrong. It is against the law for government officials to lie to the people. They did not respect the US Constitution. They did this since 9/11.\n\nThe Bush administration wanted to go to war. They planned it before they came into office. The Secretary of the Treasury said this in a book. He said the younger Bush wanted to go to war because of his father's past problems with Saddam Hussein. He also wanted to control Iraq's oil.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If the US leaves now, there could be a big problem. The country might fall apart and many more people would die. The US and the UN want to have other countries from the area help keep order in Iraq. But I am not sure this is a good idea. It could cause more problems in the long run.\n\nIraq will have trouble being in charge of itself. The government is not working well now.

I think this war started because the United States was angry after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. We thought Iraq was involved.\n\nI'm not very informed about this war. I don't know many details. But I think our goal is to help Iraq become a democracy like the United States. We also want their oil.\n\nStaying in Iraq makes people unhappy. If we stay, we have to build democracy, which takes a long time. If we leave, Iraq will be unhappy with us.\n\nI think this is a difficult decision. I don't know what to do. Do we stay and help Iraq? Or do we go home and let them start again?\n\nI'm not sure. I have many thoughts. One thing is clear: it's not fair to stay in Iraq forever. We should not call it a war because it was not officially declared.\n\nWe use guns to show our power. But is this the right reason to stay? I don't think so.\n\nI feel bad for President Bush. He's getting a bad name because of this war. It reminds me of the Vietnam War. That was an undeclared war and it didn't work out well.\n\nI have friends whose family members are in Iraq. I feel bad for them. But if we stay, we might be changing Iraq too much. They have their own culture, and we might make things worse.\n\nWe might be creating a bigger problem with Al-Kaida.

It allows for freedom of religion. Making a law about this would be wrong and go against what is already written in the Constitution.\n\nI think the government should not be involved in this issue.

            "There is much disagreement about the war in Iraq. I do not think the government was honest about the reasons for fighting. They said the war was connected to the attacks on September 11th. But this was not true. The government used this to get the support of the American people.\n\nI am against war. I do not think a preemptive attack is ever a good idea. The war in Iraq was like the war in Vietnam. The US government did not learn from its past mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government, but it was not prepared for the problems that followed.\n\nThe US tried to put a new government in Iraq. But this was not easy. It is always a long process to set up a new government. The US government made it seem easy, but it was not. Democracy is not an easy thing to create.\n\nIt is hard to make a decision about the war in Iraq. I have mixed feelings about it. In the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. He said he would finish what he started. But then I thought, how can we leave Iraq? We took away their government and their way of life. We must see it through, but at what cost? Many American soldiers have died.\n\nThe main reason for the war in Iraq was oil. The US wanted control of the oil. Another reason was that Iraq was said to have weapons of mass destruction. But no such weapons were found. We knew North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not attack them. This shows that the US government is not honest about its reasons for war.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But this is not likely.",

The internet is public, and everyone sees it.\n\nIf you are friends with someone on a website like MySpace, you will see what they post. But the school did not post the information.

It was to help another country gain democracy. \nBut now, I think we are fighting for other reasons. \nWe want to show the world that we are a strong country. \nI am not sure this is a good reason for war. \n\nI think the reason for the war was questionable from the start. \nGeorge Bush's father had problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf we wanted to help a country without a fair government, that would be a good reason. \nBut if there were personal reasons, it would not be fair. \n\nI think we made a point when we started the war. \nIt was a strong statement. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nThis is not good. \n\nIf we wanted to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that would be a good reason for war. \nBut I do not think our reason has been clear for a long time. \nWe seem to be fighting just to fight. \nWe do not want to end the war without winning. \n\nI think the war has lasted long enough. \nThe government of the other country should take care of itself. \nWe should not spend a lot of money on war. \nWe have our own problems to solve, like poverty and bad roads. \nWe need to spend money on these things. \n\nWe are spending a lot of money on war. \nIt is not good to spend a lot of money on war for a long time. \nWe should spend money on things that help our own people, like health care and education. \nNow, we are spending money to hurt our own people in a war we are losing. \n\nThis is my opinion.",
            "I have a question to ask for clarification.\n\nSomeone was able to stop something bad from happening because they found information on the internet. This person looked at Myspace, a website where people can share information. They found something that could have prevented a life from being lost.\n\nIt is true that information on the internet is open to many people. If you post something on Myspace, many people can see it. You must add someone as a friend for them to see your profile, but that means you have given them permission.\n\nWhen you put information on the internet, you must understand that many people will see it. I think it is good that someone saw the information and was able to stop something bad from happening.\n\nHowever, it is a problem to have one person watching all the students' profiles all the time. It is not fair to judge people based on what they post on the internet. It is not right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles all the time.\n\nIt depends on why someone looked at the profile. Were they looking for something important or just looking at people's profiles randomly?\n\nI have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people who can see things about me. I know that it is possible for people to get information easily. I saw a TV show about a man who got a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger. He got her to meet him in less than a minute.\n\nIt is hard to know who can see your information on the internet. You can limit what you put on the internet, but it is hard to make sure that only people you know can see it. The point of having a profile is to be able to communicate with friends.\n\nMy roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I am not sure how the school officials had the right to do that.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I know it's not easy for me to say this, but I was against it at first. Many people were. But now, it's not important to say I was against it from the start. The majority of people think it was a bad idea. \n\nIn the United States, Iraq, and all around the world, most people think the war was a mistake. About 75-80% of the world's population thinks so. In Iraq, 80% of the people think it was a bad idea. Even 70% of the U.S. troops in Iraq think the war was a mistake and want to leave within a year.\n\nThe war has been a disaster from the beginning. It's hard to fix things now. The problem is that the United States and Middle Eastern countries have very different cultures. It's hard for us to understand their way of life and bring democracy to their countries. We should consider what the people of Iraq really want, not just what our government thinks is best.\n\nSaddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought carefully before invading his country. We need to weigh the good and bad before making big decisions like that. We can see that the war has caused big problems and made things worse.\n\nI don't think our government has a good reason to stay in Iraq. We should leave now. If we leave slowly, it's okay, but I don't see a reason to stay any longer. Most Iraqis want us to leave, and they know what's best for their country. If we listen to them, it won't be our fault if things go badly. We can still help them after we leave, and it will be better for everyone.",
            "There is still a problem with women and men being treated unfairly in the United States. This is called gender discrimination.\n\nPeople are not equal everywhere. It depends on the job. Women often have a harder time. This is because society has a long history of men being in charge. Even when there is a law that says everyone is equal, it's hard to make it happen.\n\nImagine a glass ceiling that women can't break through. They have the skills and education to do a job, but they don't get the chance to do it. This happens when men are not used to working for women.\n\nIt's the same for men who stay at home with their children. Society doesn't understand this. They think men should be the ones earning money. If a man stays home, people might think he's not doing his job.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who like fashion are not always taken seriously. People think they don't know about fashion because of their style. But this is not true.\n\nChanging society is slow. We have come a long way, but we have a long way to go. We need to show people that women and men can do different things and be good at them. We can do this by talking about the good things people do, not by forcing people to accept them.\n\nIt's good that we're making progress, but we need to be careful. If we do things too fast, people might resist. We need to find a balance.\n\nPeople can be discriminated against because of where they're from or their job. If someone talks differently, they might be judged by others. This is not fair.\n\nIn conclusion, gender discrimination is a problem in the United States. We need to work together to make things more equal. We can do this by being kind and understanding, and by showing people that everyone can be good at different things.",
            "My understanding is that some places did not make marijuana a crime.  They made it a smaller problem, like a traffic ticket.  You get a fine, not arrested and taken to jail.  This makes some people happy.  But some people worry about the future.  They think a marijuana charge can still cause problems, even if it is not a crime.\n\nSome people say it costs too much money to arrest and try people for marijuana.  It costs money to take them to court and pay for lawyers.  So, some cities do not want to make marijuana a smaller problem.  They do not want to spend the money.\n\nBut some cities are okay with making marijuana a smaller problem.  Denver is one example.  People in Denver tend to be more open-minded.  This city now has more money to spend on important things like schools, food for the homeless, and help for the elderly.\n\nIt is a good idea to make marijuana a smaller problem.  But it is also true that marijuana can be a problem.  If people can buy it anywhere, they might smoke it while driving.  Smoking marijuana is not accepted in many places.  Some people do not want to see it everywhere.\n\nAlcohol can also cause problems.  It can affect how people drive and make decisions.  Marijuana can affect how people live their lives.  People react to substances differently.  Some people can use them without problems, but others cannot.\n\nSo, it is hard to say what to do about marijuana.  But it is true that both marijuana and alcohol can cause problems.  We need to be careful and think about how to use them.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nTraditional things are very important. \nThey have been done this way for a long time. \nIt is good to be connected to the past. \nBut it is also important to be able to change. \nI think this is true. \n\nMany Catholics go to church every week. \nThey do things a certain way. \nI feel that the Catholic Church does not accept people who do not follow its rules very well. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \nThis happened to my parents. \nMy mom was a Catholic and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThey could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \n\nThe Catholic Church teaches us to love others. \nBut it does not practice what it preaches. \nThis is because some of its old rules are not good. \nThe Church keeps these rules anyway. \n\nI do not think that allowing priests to marry would make a difference. \nSome people who do bad things will do them anyway. \nThey will hurt children, no matter if they are married or not. \nThis is a big problem. \n\nWe should focus on stopping people from hurting children. \nAllowing priests to marry will not solve this problem. \nWe need to find other ways to stop this from happening.",
            "I'm not sure about this issue yet.  \nI don't know if one side is right or wrong.  \nThis is a very difficult problem we face now.  \nIt's hard to decide when the line between church and state is unclear.  \nAlso, defining marriage is a very hard job because it can offend people.  \n\nI don't know if marriage should be decided by the government.  \nSome people think it's a special ceremony, like a sacrament.  \nIf that's true, then people in a marriage could get tax breaks.  \nOr they could get special treatment from the government because they were baptized.  \nBut I think the government should just look at marriage as a civil union.  \nIt's a union between two people, and that's all.  \n\nThey shouldn't ask what kind of marriage it is or what church the couple belongs to.  \nIt's just two people who are together.  \nThe issue of gay marriage is similar.  \nIt's just two people who are in a union.  \n\nIf all the states can agree on this, then they should make it a federal law.  \nBut making a constitutional amendment to stop gay marriage is not right.  \nThe constitution should not be changed just because many people don't like it.  \nIt's not important enough to change the constitution over.  \nWe just need to accept that marriage is between two people who love each other.  \n\nNo, I don't think the constitution should be changed for this reason.",
            "I grew up in a Christian family. For me, homosexuality is a complicated issue. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with all parts of the gay lifestyle. But I think it should be legal. I do not think it is a national problem. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are Republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how the state feels about this issue. I do not think you can disagree with a state's decision if it decides to allow gay marriage. You chose to live there.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. So, each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already said this. I do not think the president should decide what is best for every state. George Bush does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state runs itself.\n\nSome things should be decided by each state. George Bush will not be president for much longer. If a new president wants to allow gay marriage, the law might change. But that is not necessary. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nNo, I do not agree with that. I think each state should make its own decision about gay marriage.",
            "I think school officials have the right to see what students are posting on the internet. Myspace is a public place where people share things for everyone to see. If you post something on the internet, you have to be ready for anyone to see it, including school officials.\n\nEven if you don't put the school's name on it, they can still find it if they want to. They can use their computers at home to look for it. The school officials' job is to keep students safe. If they find something that can help them do this, I think it's okay for them to look at it.\n\nFor example, if they go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking, I think that's okay. It's their job to keep the school safe and make sure students are not breaking the rules.\n\nBut if they just go on the internet to catch students and get them in trouble, I think that's not right. It's an invasion of privacy. However, if they find something that helps them keep the school safe, I think it's okay.\n\nSome people might think it's not right for school officials to look at what students are posting on the internet. But I think it's okay as long as it helps keep the school safe. We had lock-down drills in my school to prepare for emergencies. It's like the school officials are doing the same thing, trying to keep the school safe.\n\nThey are not trying to catch students; they are trying to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting. We had a shooting at Columbine High School, and it was very sad. So, I think school officials are doing the right thing by looking at what students are posting on the internet.\n\nWe have to be careful about what we post on the internet because it can come back and hurt us. It's like a big record of everything we do. If we say or do something bad when we're a student, it can come back and cause problems when we're older. It's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nSo, I think school officials are okay to look at what students are posting on the internet if it helps them keep the school safe. But they should not just look for ways to catch students. They should look for ways to help the school and keep everyone safe.",
            "I want to talk about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea. I was personally affected by 9/11. I wanted to go to that country and make them feel what we felt after 9/11.\n\nHowever, I think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term effects of our actions. We went to war without a plan. This was a big mistake.\n\nI was for the war at first, but now I am against it. I don't think it helped. The people in that country are fighting with each other. They can't fight with us if they can't even get along with themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 changed my feelings about that country. I don't care what happens there anymore. I think they are not very nice people when it comes to war. They just want to fight. They don't want to make their country better.\n\nI think we went to war for revenge, not a good reason. We were angry and wanted to fight back. We didn't think about what could happen. President Bush decided to go to war with Iraq. I understand why he did it, but I think we should have had a better plan.\n\nWe didn't have unity and clarity about what we wanted to do in that country. We didn't think about how to create order. I think this would have helped us a lot.\n\nI don't think we can change those people. They will always be the same. We are not helping them by staying there. We are just hurting ourselves. We can't stay in that country forever. When we leave, it will collapse. I think we should leave now."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

But the Church is not changing. Many people disagree with the Church on these issues.

But everyone has a family and other people they love. Priests should be able to have families and love their families too.\n\nThe Church should change its rules.

They should have the right to own property and get medical care together.\n\nIf a gay person is sick, their partner can't visit them in the hospital. This is not fair. They should be able to be together.\n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are happy and successful. They have the same factors that make a relationship good.\n\nGay people are not asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government.\n\nThe government should not make laws based on one person's or group's religion. This is called separation of church and state.\n\nIf a couple has a civil union, why can't they get married? It's the same in many ways.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and children.

            "I think the church has changed over time to fit the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I grew up going to church every Sunday. I would wear nice clothes and shoes that matched. My church was in a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. They had a teenage mass that was shorter, only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually now, even for morning masses. They wear jeans and khakis. This is a big change. \n\nI don't think changing the rules, like allowing female priests or married priests, would have stopped the problems with some priests and children. Some men are married and still have these problems. It's not because they can or can't get married. It's because of who they are. \n\nThere are other religions where priests can be married. For example, some ministers in the Seventh Day Adventist church can get married. If they want to be married and practice their faith, they might choose a different church. \n\nI think the reason some priests did bad things is because of their own feelings, not because of their job. People are born with certain feelings, like being attracted to children. It's not because of how they were raised. The church couldn't have prevented these problems.\n\nIf some priests knew about the problems and kept it secret, that's wrong. But I don't think that's the case for all priests. \n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",

They connected Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks. This makes me very angry.\n\nThe Bush administration told many lies to the American people. They have not admitted to these lies. Colin Powell, a high official, said he was not sure about the evidence when he talked to the UN.\n\nI think this is very bad. It is against the law for government officials to lie.

We should not use guns to show that we are powerful. \n\nWe did not declare war on Iraq officially. A declared war needs the approval of Congress. \n\nI think we should try to help Iraq, but it is wasting our resources. It is also making President Bush look bad. \n\nThe Vietnam War was also an undeclared war. It is now called a meaningless war. \n\nI do not know what to say. It is hard to make a decision. \n\nThere are many families with sons and daughters in Iraq.

This shows he has a preference for one religion over others. Churches should decide this, not the president or the government.\n\nThere is no good reason to make this law, except for personal opinions.

The war in Iraq was like the war in Vietnam.  The US should have learned from their mistakes in Vietnam.  In Vietnam, the US tried to put in a new government and it did not work.  Many American soldiers died in the war.\n\nThe US government took out the Iraqi government and wanted to put in a new one.  But they were not prepared for what would happen after that.  There was a lot of violence and chaos.  The US is still trying to help the Iraqis build a new government.\n\nI think the US government made a big mistake by going to war.  They did not plan for all the things that could happen.  The war has been going on for a long time and many American soldiers are still dying.  The US is trying to help the Iraqis learn to police their own country, but it is a slow process.\n\nI do not think the US government was honest with the American people about why they went to war.  They said it would be a short and easy war, but it has not been.  It takes a long time to build a new government and make it successful.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in a situation like this.  If the US went to war, they should finish what they started.  But we also have to think about the American soldiers who are dying.  Why are we helping Iraq and not other countries?  I think it is because of the oil in Iraq.\n\nThe US government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were not found.  We know North Korea has these weapons and we are not fighting them.  I do not think the US government is being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq.

If you are friends with someone on Myspace, you will see what they post. But it's not the school that sees it. Someone else sees it and tells the school.\n\nThe school must act on it.

Someone overheard a student talking about something, and they called the school. They looked at the student's Facebook and found some things that might be jokes, but became serious in that situation.\n\nWhen you put something on the internet, there's no privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it. If you don't want someone to see it, don't post it.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on Myspace and Facebook. If someone brings something to their attention, it's a different story. If there is a danger, they must take it seriously.\n\nBut officials should not monitor students' phone conversations or texts. If it's brought to their attention, then it's a different situation.\n\nA teacher should not make a fake Facebook or Myspace account and friend their students. That's the same as monitoring them. I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to see what they do, especially if they post pictures of themselves drinking. That's not my place.",
            "I think the war has lasted too long. \n\nThe main reason was good at first - to give democracy to another country. \n\nBut now, I think we are fighting for different reasons. Maybe we want to prove we are a strong country. \n\nOur motives may have been questionable from the start. We were involved in a disagreement with Saddam Hussein's country long ago. \n\nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country with no fair government, that would be a good reason. But with personal problems involved, it wouldn't be fair. \n\nI think we made our point in the first few months. Starting the war was a statement in itself. \n\nBut the war has lasted for many years. I think it has gone on too long.\n\nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a good reason for war. But our reasons have changed. Now it seems we are fighting just to fight. \n\nWe don't want to end the war without winning. \n\nI think the war has lasted long enough. The country's government will have to take care of itself soon. \n\nWe are spending a lot of money on the war. This money could be used for our own problems, like poverty and bad roads. \n\nWe have many problems at home that need money. We should spend it on things like healthcare and schools. \n\nRight now, our money is being used to lose the war and hurt our own citizens. \n\nThat is all I think.",
            "I have a question about something. \n\nYou see, someone found out about this because they looked online. They went to a website and found some information. I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. If you put something on the internet, everyone can see it. \n\nOn a website called Myspace, you need to have a friend to see someone's profile. But when you accept someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see what you have on your profile. So, if you put something on the internet, many people may see it. \n\nI think it's good that someone found out about this. It may have saved a life. However, this is a problem. We can't have one person looking at everyone's online profiles all the time. That's not fair. \n\nWe can't have someone's job be to look at everyone's profiles. That would be wrong. But, it depends on the situation. If someone is looking for information to help someone, that's different. \n\nI have a Facebook account, but I don't have a Myspace account. I worry about people seeing things about me online. There are people who can get information easily. I saw a TV show about this. A man got a girl's screen name and was talking to her on instant messenger in a few minutes. \n\nIt's hard to protect your information online. People can see many things about you, like your pictures and your favorite classes. I try not to put too much on my Facebook. But it's hard because I want to be able to talk to my friends. \n\nI only accept people I know on Facebook. But you never know who can see what. My roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure if that was right. I don't know how the school had the right to tell students what to do.",
            "The Iraq War is a big issue. I want to talk about it again. \n\nSome people say I'm a hypocrite for talking about it. I was against the war at first. But now I think it's not very important. Most people in the world think the war was a bad idea. \n\nSurveys in the United States, Iraq, and many other countries show this. About 75 to 80 percent of people think the war was a bad idea. Even 80 percent of Iraqi people and 70 percent of US soldiers in Iraq think so. \n\nI think the war was a disaster from the start. It's hard to make good decisions when there's a big difference in culture between the US and the Middle East. \n\nWe tried to bring democracy to Iraq, but it's not what the people there wanted. Saddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the problems before going to war. \n\nNow, it's hard to find a good reason to stay in Iraq. I don't agree with the US government's ideas for staying there. If they want to leave slowly, I wouldn't be against that. But I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. \n\nMany Iraqis want us to leave. We're helping them, but they're telling us to go. I think they know what's best for their country. If we listen to them and leave, we won't be responsible if things get worse. \n\nIf we help Iraq again after we leave, we might be seen as good people. We're not good people in the Middle East now, but it will be better than how things are today.",
            "There is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. \n\nI think this is true in many workplaces. Women often face more difficulties because of a glass ceiling. This is like a barrier that prevents them from getting to a higher position. Even if there is equality, people often have trouble working under a woman.\n\nThis is because society has been this way for a long time. Many women see a job they can do well, but the board may not choose them for the position. This is because women are not often in important jobs.\n\nThe same thing happens to men and other groups. For example, men who stay at home to care for children are often looked down upon. Society thinks men should be the breadwinners. This can be hard on these men because they want to take care of their children.\n\nIn the fashion industry, many people do not take men seriously if they are interested in fashion. This is because men who like fashion are often different. People do not understand their style.\n\nI think there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing this is hard because society has a strong idea of how things should be. We have made progress, but it is slow. Women are now in important jobs and men are staying home to care for children. This is changing people's views.\n\nWe need to promote the good qualities of people who are often discriminated against. We should not push too hard, or people will resist. I think we are at a good point where this is happening slowly. I do not know if there is anything else we can do.\n\nPeople from different places and with different backgrounds also face discrimination. For example, someone from a farm may not have perfect grammar, but they can be very smart. They may get a job as a CEO, but other men may not respect them because of their grammar.\n\nThis is another example of how people are often judged unfairly.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana is not fully legal. But some places have made it not a crime. This means it is not a serious offense like a crime. It is more like a traffic ticket. You get cited and do not get arrested.\n\nIf you get a citation for marijuana, it can affect your future. This can make it harder to get a job. But some people say it is better to not make it a crime. This is because it costs a lot of money to arrest and put people in jail. Then the court has to deal with the case. This costs even more money.\n\nSome cities do not have enough money. They do not want to make this change. But some cities, like Denver, are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea. They have more money to spend on important things like education and helping the elderly.\n\nI think it is a good idea. But marijuana must be used carefully. It should not be everywhere. There are good reasons to be careful. If it is allowed everywhere, people might smoke and drive. This is not safe.\n\nMarijuana can affect people in different ways. Some people are more careful and do not get into trouble. Others are not so careful. Alcohol can also be a problem. It can affect people's ability to think and move.\n\nI think people react differently to substances like marijuana and alcohol. Some people can use them without trouble. Others get into trouble. We should be careful and think about how substances affect us.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nMany things they do are old customs. \nThey have done these things for a long time. \nIt's good to have old traditions. \nBut it's also important to change. \nMany Catholics think they must go to church every week. \nThey are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel the Catholic Church is not kind to people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian, but my mom was a Catholic. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry my parents because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not being kind to other religions. \nWe learned to love others in Catholic school. \nBut it seems hypocritical to love others and not accept them. \n\nI think the Catholic rules tell you to do things. \nBut the way Catholics act goes against the rules. \nThe rules are old and need to change. \nBut they continue to keep them. \n\nI do not think this would make priests behave better. \nSome people who hurt children will do that even if they are married. \nIt's because they are hurting children, not because they are not married. \nSo, allowing priests to be married would not stop this behavior. \n\nIn my opinion, people who hurt children will do it anyway. \nIt's not because of marriage.",
            "I am having trouble making a decision on this issue. I do not know if one side is right or wrong. This is a very difficult topic. \n\nThe separation of church and state is a problem. Also, defining marriage is hard. We do not want to upset anyone. \n\nI do not know if the government should decide what a marriage is. Marriage is sometimes a sacrament. People get tax breaks if they are married. \n\nIf two people are married, the government should look at it like a civil union. It is the same for everyone. The government should not consider what kind of marriage it is. \n\nI think gay marriage is like any other marriage. Two people want to be together. They should have a civil union. \n\nIf all states agree, they should make it a law for the country. But a constitutional change to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue. \n\nThis issue is not important enough to change the constitution. We do not need to change the constitution to stop gay marriage. \n\nNo, I do not think so.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. This makes me think about gay marriage in a confusing way. I have many friends who are gay. I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think gay marriage should be allowed. It is not a national issue. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nMany states are democratic or republican. Democratic states often support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know its opinion. You chose to live there. So, it's not your place to disagree with its decision. I think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already said this. But I will say it again. I do not think the president should decide for the whole country. George Bush is not in every state. He should not decide how each state runs itself. Some things should be left to each state. He will be out of office soon. If a new president allows gay marriage, it will change again. Each state should decide for itself. They are the ones who will live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Myspace is a public place on the internet. You can see what others post there. School officials have the right to check it. They can see what students post, even if it's not under the school's name. They can see it when they are at home.\n\nIf school officials check Myspace to stop students from hurting themselves or others, that's okay. It's their job to keep students safe. They want to make sure students are not doing anything bad.\n\nSome people think it's an invasion of privacy when school officials check Myspace. But if it makes the school a safer place, it's not an invasion. School officials are just doing their job.\n\nWhen you post something on the internet, anyone can see it. You can't take it back. That's why you have to be careful what you say online. School officials can't help but see what students post. They want to keep students safe.\n\nSchools have rules and drills to keep students safe. They practice what to do in case of an emergency. School officials check Myspace to make sure students are not doing anything bad. They want to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nIn this case, school officials were just trying to keep students safe. They checked Myspace to see if students were doing anything bad. They want to make sure students are safe in school.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea. I was affected by 9/11. I thought we should go to their country and stop their violence. But I think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term effects.\n\nWe went to their country without a plan. I think that was a bad idea. It didn't work out well for us. I don't think we helped them. They will fight with each other, and they can't fight with us if they're busy fighting themselves.\n\nI'm not interested in their problems. They can solve their own problems. I think they're a different kind of people when it comes to war. We think war is bad, but they see it as a way to get what they want.\n\nWe went to their country thinking we could change their country. But I don't think that's possible. They will always be the way they are. We should have thought before we acted. We should have made a plan.\n\nI think we went to their country for revenge. President Bush wanted to go because people were angry after 9/11. I think he made a mistake, but I understand why he did it. We couldn't just let them do what they did and then do nothing.\n\nWe should have had a clear plan to create order in their country. But we didn't. We didn't know what we were doing. We didn't work together. That would have helped us.\n\nI don't think we should stay in their country. We've made some progress, but not enough. If we leave, their country will collapse. We can't stay there forever. It's not good for us to stay there. We should leave and let them solve their own problems."

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

But the Church is not changing. Many people disagree with the Church on these issues. They think the Church has the wrong view.\n\nIf you are for abortion or gay marriage, you may not want to be part of a Church that says these things are wrong. You might feel uncomfortable going against what the Church believes.\n\nThe Church does not want women priests. The Church says priests are married to God. But everyone has a family and other people they love. Priests should be able to have families and love their families too.\n\nThe Church should change its rules. Priests should be able to get married and have families. This would not hurt the Church. It would make priests happy and help them be good leaders.",

These are things people are born with.\n\nIt's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. This is not fair.\n\nThe federal government should not get involved in this issue. It's not a security issue or a moral issue. It's just about people being who they are.\n\nPeople are born gay. They shouldn't be punished for it. The government should not tell them they are wrong.\n\nThe government should not try to control people's private lives. They should let people be who they are.\n\nThis is just my opinion. I think it's fair to let everyone be equal.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There is no good reason not to.\n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to straight families. But this is not true. It's a different kind of love and family.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin. You can't compare them. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should have the right to own property and get medical care together.\n\nIf a gay person is sick, their partner can't visit them in the hospital. This is not fair. They should be able to be together.\n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are happy and successful. They have the same factors that make a relationship good.\n\nGay people are not asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government.\n\nThe government should not make laws based on one person's or group's religion. This is called separation of church and state.\n\nIf a couple has a civil union, why can't they get married? It's the same in many ways.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and children. But children of gay couples are the same as children of straight couples. They need love and care.\n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. They face problems in public schools.\n\nGay couples can be good parents. They can be involved in their community like straight couples.\n\nThe federal government should make gay marriage legal everywhere. The amendment that bans it is not fair.\n\nPresident Bush has strong opinions about this. He thinks it's against his religion. But morality is different for everyone.\n\nWe should not make laws just because some people don't like it. We should think about what's fair for everyone.\n\nSome people think gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true.

            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Just because a medicine is not allowed does not mean it has good effects. I think it is wrong to say it should be available to the public, but it may be good to use it for medical reasons.\n\nSome medicines are not allowed, but we use them in the pharmacy because they are good for people. For example, oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled medicines. We use them often because they help people. If people think marijuana is bad because it is not allowed, they should consider its good effects.\n\nMarijuana is not like alcohol. If you use too much of either, it can cause problems. However, it is not the same. I think we should not use it suddenly. Instead, we should make it clear that it is not bad, and people will use it responsibly.\n\nMany people think marijuana is bad because it is not allowed. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they may use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has changed over time to fit the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I grew up going to church every Sunday. I would wear nice clothes and shoes that matched. My church was in a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. They had a teenage mass that was shorter, only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually now, even for morning masses. They wear jeans and khakis. This is a big change. \n\nI don't think changing the rules, like allowing female priests or married priests, would have stopped the problems with some priests and children. Some men are married and still have these problems. It's not because they can or can't get married. It's because of who they are. \n\nThere are other religions where priests can be married. For example, some ministers in the Seventh Day Adventist church can get married. If they want to be married and practice their faith, they might choose a different church. \n\nI think the reason some priests did bad things is because of their own feelings, not because of their job. People are born with certain feelings, like being attracted to children. It's not because of how they were raised. The church couldn't have prevented these problems.\n\nIf some priests knew about the problems and kept it secret, that's wrong. But I don't think that's the case for all priests. \n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea at first, but I think many people were still upset after the 9/11 attacks. They used the 9/11 attacks as a reason to go to war in Iraq. But there were other reasons, not just the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe Bush administration said Saddam Hussein had arms of mass destruction, but this was not true. They connected Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks. This makes me very angry.\n\nThe Bush administration told many lies to the American people. They have not admitted to these lies. Colin Powell, a high official, said he was not sure about the evidence when he talked to the UN.\n\nI think this is very bad. It is against the law for government officials to lie. The Bush administration does not respect the law and the constitution. They have been trying to change the law since the 9/11 attacks.\n\nI think the Bush administration wanted to go to war from the beginning. The treasury secretary said this in a book. He said George Bush, the younger, wanted to go to war because his father was angry at Saddam Hussein. Bush wanted to increase the country's oil supply.\n\nThis is not a good way to make decisions. The war has lasted too long. If we leave now, there will be problems. The country might become very violent and many more people will die.\n\nThe UN and the US are trying to find a new way. They want a group of neighboring countries to help keep order. But this might not be a good idea. Iraq's freedom will be a big problem.\n\nThe news says the new government is not working well. The parliament is not effective and the prime minister does not have control. A man named Muqtada al-Sadr is still a problem. His party has many seats in the parliament.

            "I have thoughts about the war in Iraq. \n\nLet me think for a moment. \n\nIn my opinion, the war in Iraq is not very important. We did not declare war on Iraq officially. It seems like we went to war because we thought Iraq was involved in the 9/11 attacks. \n\nI am not very interested in the details of the war. But I know we are staying in Iraq to try to build a democracy. We also want to get oil from Iraq. \n\nBut I think we should not stay in Iraq. It makes many people unhappy. \n\nIf we stay, we will have to try to build democracy. This will take a long time. If we leave, the people in Iraq will be angry with us. They will have to start all over again. \n\nI do not know what to say about the war. It is a very difficult topic. \n\nI think the war in Iraq should continue, but it should not be called a war. We should not use guns to show that we are powerful. \n\nWe did not declare war on Iraq officially. A declared war needs the approval of Congress. \n\nI think we should try to help Iraq, but it is wasting our resources. It is also making President Bush look bad. \n\nThe Vietnam War was also an undeclared war. It is now called a meaningless war. \n\nI do not know what to say. It is hard to make a decision. \n\nThere are many families with sons and daughters in Iraq. I want them to be safe, but I also do not want to hurt the people of Iraq. \n\nIf we stay in Iraq, we will try to change their culture to be like ours. This will be bad for them. Their hate for the U.S. will grow, and the Al-Kaida group will get stronger. \n\nI think the war in Iraq will go on for a long time. It is a very complicated issue. \n\nThat is my opinion.",

This means the government should not control what churches do.\n\nThe constitution is clear on this. If we try to make a new law that says something is not allowed, it goes against what is already written. That is not right.\n\nSome people want to make it a law that one church's beliefs are more important than another's. Most Catholics and Christians do not agree with this idea. But it is not up to the government to decide what churches can or cannot do.\n\nThe separation of church and state is very important. It allows for freedom of religion in the United States. Some people want to change the constitution to make a new law. This would be wrong because it goes against what is already written.\n\nIt would be one of the only laws that restricts people, not the government. I don't think this is right.\n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this issue. The president is trying to make this law because it is against his own beliefs as a Catholic. This shows he has a preference for one religion over others. Churches should decide this, not the president or the government.\n\nThere is no good reason to make this law, except for personal opinions. It will not help the economy, and it may even help society.\n\nIn short, the government should not be involved in what churches do. The constitution is clear, and we should follow it.",
            "I want to talk about the war in Iraq.  The US government did not tell the American people the whole truth about why they wanted to go to war.  I think they used the attacks on September 11th to make people angry and want to fight.  But the two things were not connected.\n\nI am against war and especially going to war to attack first.  The war in Iraq was like the war in Vietnam.  The US should have learned from their mistakes in Vietnam.  In Vietnam, the US tried to put in a new government and it did not work.  Many American soldiers died in the war.\n\nThe US government took out the Iraqi government and wanted to put in a new one.  But they were not prepared for what would happen after that.  There was a lot of violence and chaos.  The US is still trying to help the Iraqis build a new government.\n\nI think the US government made a big mistake by going to war.  They did not plan for all the things that could happen.  The war has been going on for a long time and many American soldiers are still dying.  The US is trying to help the Iraqis learn to police their own country, but it is a slow process.\n\nI do not think the US government was honest with the American people about why they went to war.  They said it would be a short and easy war, but it has not been.  It takes a long time to build a new government and make it successful.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in a situation like this.  If the US went to war, they should finish what they started.  But we also have to think about the American soldiers who are dying.  Why are we helping Iraq and not other countries?  I think it is because of the oil in Iraq.\n\nThe US government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were not found.  We know North Korea has these weapons and we are not fighting them.  I do not think the US government is being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq.

You put something on the internet, and it affects how people think of you. If you talk about hurting people or things, someone will see it. \n\nThe internet is seen by everyone. If you are friends with someone on Myspace, you will see what they post. But it's not the school that sees it. Someone else sees it and tells the school.\n\nThe school must act on it. They can't ignore it in case something bad happens. They might be able to prevent it.\n\nBut it's hard to know what to take seriously. People sometimes joke online. Like what happened at my school.

They looked at the student's Facebook and found some things that might be jokes, but became serious in that situation.\n\nWhen you put something on the internet, there's no privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it. If you don't want someone to see it, don't post it.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on Myspace and Facebook.

            "I think the war has lasted too long. \n\nThe main reason was good at first - to give democracy to another country. \n\nBut now, I think we are fighting for different reasons.

We were involved in a disagreement with Saddam Hussein's country long ago. \n\nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country with no fair government, that would be a good reason.

            "I have a question about something. \n\nYou see, someone found out about this because they looked online. They went to a website and found some information. I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. If you put something on the internet, everyone can see it. \n\nOn a website called Myspace, you need to have a friend to see someone's profile. But when you accept someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see what you have on your profile. So, if you put something on the internet, many people may see it. \n\nI think it's good that someone found out about this. It may have saved a life. However, this is a problem. We can't have one person looking at everyone's online profiles all the time. That's not fair. \n\nWe can't have someone's job be to look at everyone's profiles. That would be wrong. But, it depends on the situation. If someone is looking for information to help someone, that's different. \n\nI have a Facebook account, but I don't have a Myspace account. I worry about people seeing things about me online. There are people who can get information easily. I saw a TV show about this. A man got a girl's screen name and was talking to her on instant messenger in a few minutes. \n\nIt's hard to protect your information online.

But it's hard because I want to be able to talk to my friends. \n\nI only accept people I know on Facebook. But you never know who can see what. My roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure if that was right. I don't know how the school had the right to tell students what to do.",
            "The Iraq War is a big issue. I want to talk about it again. \n\nSome people say I'm a hypocrite for talking about it. I was against the war at first. But now I think it's not very important. Most people in the world think the war was a bad idea. \n\nSurveys in the United States, Iraq, and many other countries show this. About 75 to 80 percent of people think the war was a bad idea. Even 80 percent of Iraqi people and 70 percent of US soldiers in Iraq think so. \n\nI think the war was a disaster from the start. It's hard to make good decisions when there's a big difference in culture between the US and the Middle East. \n\nWe tried to bring democracy to Iraq, but it's not what the people there wanted. Saddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the problems before going to war. \n\nNow, it's hard to find a good reason to stay in Iraq. I don't agree with the US government's ideas for staying there. If they want to leave slowly, I wouldn't be against that. But I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. \n\nMany Iraqis want us to leave. We're helping them, but they're telling us to go. I think they know what's best for their country. If we listen to them and leave, we won't be responsible if things get worse. \n\nIf we help Iraq again after we leave, we might be seen as good people. We're not good people in the Middle East now, but it will be better than how things are today.",
            "There is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. \n\nI think this is true in many workplaces. Women often face more difficulties because of a glass ceiling. This is like a barrier that prevents them from getting to a higher position. Even if there is equality, people often have trouble working under a woman.\n\nThis is because society has been this way for a long time. Many women see a job they can do well, but the board may not choose them for the position. This is because women are not often in important jobs.\n\nThe same thing happens to men and other groups. For example, men who stay at home to care for children are often looked down upon. Society thinks men should be the breadwinners. This can be hard on these men because they want to take care of their children.\n\nIn the fashion industry, many people do not take men seriously if they are interested in fashion. This is because men who like fashion are often different. People do not understand their style.\n\nI think there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing this is hard because society has a strong idea of how things should be. We have made progress, but it is slow. Women are now in important jobs and men are staying home to care for children. This is changing people's views.\n\nWe need to promote the good qualities of people who are often discriminated against. We should not push too hard, or people will resist. I think we are at a good point where this is happening slowly. I do not know if there is anything else we can do.\n\nPeople from different places and with different backgrounds also face discrimination. For example, someone from a farm may not have perfect grammar, but they can be very smart. They may get a job as a CEO, but other men may not respect them because of their grammar.\n\nThis is another example of how people are often judged unfairly.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana is not fully legal. But some places have made it not a crime. This means it is not a serious offense like a crime. It is more like a traffic ticket. You get cited and do not get arrested.\n\nIf you get a citation for marijuana, it can affect your future. This can make it harder to get a job. But some people say it is better to not make it a crime. This is because it costs a lot of money to arrest and put people in jail. Then the court has to deal with the case. This costs even more money.\n\nSome cities do not have enough money. They do not want to make this change. But some cities, like Denver, are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea. They have more money to spend on important things like education and helping the elderly.\n\nI think it is a good idea. But marijuana must be used carefully. It should not be everywhere. There are good reasons to be careful. If it is allowed everywhere, people might smoke and drive. This is not safe.\n\nMarijuana can affect people in different ways. Some people are more careful and do not get into trouble. Others are not so careful. Alcohol can also be a problem. It can affect people's ability to think and move.\n\nI think people react differently to substances like marijuana and alcohol. Some people can use them without trouble. Others get into trouble. We should be careful and think about how substances affect us.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nMany things they do are old customs. \nThey have done these things for a long time. \nIt's good to have old traditions. \nBut it's also important to change. \nMany Catholics think they must go to church every week. \nThey are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel the Catholic Church is not kind to people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian, but my mom was a Catholic. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry my parents because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not being kind to other religions. \nWe learned to love others in Catholic school. \nBut it seems hypocritical to love others and not accept them. \n\nI think the Catholic rules tell you to do things. \nBut the way Catholics act goes against the rules. \nThe rules are old and need to change. \nBut they continue to keep them. \n\nI do not think this would make priests behave better. \nSome people who hurt children will do that even if they are married. \nIt's because they are hurting children, not because they are not married. \nSo, allowing priests to be married would not stop this behavior. \n\nIn my opinion, people who hurt children will do it anyway. \nIt's not because of marriage.",
            "I am having trouble making a decision on this issue. I do not know if one side is right or wrong. This is a very difficult topic. \n\nThe separation of church and state is a problem. Also, defining marriage is hard. We do not want to upset anyone. \n\nI do not know if the government should decide what a marriage is. Marriage is sometimes a sacrament. People get tax breaks if they are married. \n\nIf two people are married, the government should look at it like a civil union. It is the same for everyone. The government should not consider what kind of marriage it is. \n\nI think gay marriage is like any other marriage. Two people want to be together. They should have a civil union. \n\nIf all states agree, they should make it a law for the country. But a constitutional change to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue. \n\nThis issue is not important enough to change the constitution. We do not need to change the constitution to stop gay marriage. \n\nNo, I do not think so.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. This makes me think about gay marriage in a confusing way. I have many friends who are gay. I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think gay marriage should be allowed. It is not a national issue. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nMany states are democratic or republican. Democratic states often support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know its opinion. You chose to live there. So, it's not your place to disagree with its decision. I think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already said this. But I will say it again. I do not think the president should decide for the whole country. George Bush is not in every state. He should not decide how each state runs itself. Some things should be left to each state. He will be out of office soon. If a new president allows gay marriage, it will change again. Each state should decide for itself. They are the ones who will live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Myspace is a public place on the internet. You can see what others post there. School officials have the right to check it. They can see what students post, even if it's not under the school's name. They can see it when they are at home.\n\nIf school officials check Myspace to stop students from hurting themselves or others, that's okay. It's their job to keep students safe. They want to make sure students are not doing anything bad.\n\nSome people think it's an invasion of privacy when school officials check Myspace. But if it makes the school a safer place, it's not an invasion. School officials are just doing their job.\n\nWhen you post something on the internet, anyone can see it. You can't take it back. That's why you have to be careful what you say online. School officials can't help but see what students post. They want to keep students safe.\n\nSchools have rules and drills to keep students safe. They practice what to do in case of an emergency. School officials check Myspace to make sure students are not doing anything bad. They want to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nIn this case, school officials were just trying to keep students safe. They checked Myspace to see if students were doing anything bad. They want to make sure students are safe in school.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea. I was affected by 9/11. I thought we should go to their country and stop their violence. But I think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term effects.\n\nWe went to their country without a plan. I think that was a bad idea. It didn't work out well for us. I don't think we helped them. They will fight with each other, and they can't fight with us if they're busy fighting themselves.\n\nI'm not interested in their problems. They can solve their own problems. I think they're a different kind of people when it comes to war. We think war is bad, but they see it as a way to get what they want.\n\nWe went to their country thinking we could change their country. But I don't think that's possible. They will always be the way they are. We should have thought before we acted. We should have made a plan.\n\nI think we went to their country for revenge. President Bush wanted to go because people were angry after 9/11. I think he made a mistake, but I understand why he did it. We couldn't just let them do what they did and then do nothing.\n\nWe should have had a clear plan to create order in their country. But we didn't. We didn't know what we were doing. We didn't work together. That would have helped us.\n\nI don't think we should stay in their country. We've made some progress, but not enough. If we leave, their country will collapse. We can't stay there forever. It's not good for us to stay there. We should leave and let them solve their own problems."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

But the Church is not changing. Many people disagree with the Church on these issues. They think the Church has the wrong view.\n\nIf you are for abortion or gay marriage, you may not want to be part of a Church that says these things are wrong. You might feel uncomfortable going against what the Church believes.\n\nThe Church does not want women priests. The Church says priests are married to God. But everyone has a family and other people they love. Priests should be able to have families and love their families too.\n\nThe Church should change its rules. Priests should be able to get married and have families. This would not hurt the Church. It would make priests happy and help them be good leaders.",

These are things people are born with.\n\nIt's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. This is not fair.\n\nThe federal government should not get involved in this issue. It's not a security issue or a moral issue. It's just about people being who they are.\n\nPeople are born gay. They shouldn't be punished for it. The government should not tell them they are wrong.\n\nThe government should not try to control people's private lives. They should let people be who they are.\n\nThis is just my opinion. I think it's fair to let everyone be equal.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There is no good reason not to.\n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to straight families. But this is not true. It's a different kind of love and family.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin. You can't compare them. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should have the right to own property and get medical care together.\n\nIf a gay person is sick, their partner can't visit them in the hospital. This is not fair. They should be able to be together.\n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are happy and successful. They have the same factors that make a relationship good.\n\nGay people are not asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government.\n\nThe government should not make laws based on one person's or group's religion. This is called separation of church and state.\n\nIf a couple has a civil union, why can't they get married? It's the same in many ways.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and children. But children of gay couples are the same as children of straight couples. They need love and care.\n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. They face problems in public schools.\n\nGay couples can be good parents. They can be involved in their community like straight couples.\n\nThe federal government should make gay marriage legal everywhere. The amendment that bans it is not fair.\n\nPresident Bush has strong opinions about this. He thinks it's against his religion. But morality is different for everyone.\n\nWe should not make laws just because some people don't like it. We should think about what's fair for everyone.\n\nSome people think gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true.

            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Just because a medicine is not allowed does not mean it has good effects. I think it is wrong to say it should be available to the public, but it may be good to use it for medical reasons.\n\nSome medicines are not allowed, but we use them in the pharmacy because they are good for people. For example, oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled medicines. We use them often because they help people. If people think marijuana is bad because it is not allowed, they should consider its good effects.\n\nMarijuana is not like alcohol. If you use too much of either, it can cause problems. However, it is not the same. I think we should not use it suddenly. Instead, we should make it clear that it is not bad, and people will use it responsibly.\n\nMany people think marijuana is bad because it is not allowed. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they may use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has changed over time to fit the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I grew up going to church every Sunday. I would wear nice clothes and shoes that matched. My church was in a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. They had a teenage mass that was shorter, only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually now, even for morning masses. They wear jeans and khakis. This is a big change. \n\nI don't think changing the rules, like allowing female priests or married priests, would have stopped the problems with some priests and children. Some men are married and still have these problems. It's not because they can or can't get married. It's because of who they are. \n\nThere are other religions where priests can be married. For example, some ministers in the Seventh Day Adventist church can get married. If they want to be married and practice their faith, they might choose a different church. \n\nI think the reason some priests did bad things is because of their own feelings, not because of their job. People are born with certain feelings, like being attracted to children. It's not because of how they were raised. The church couldn't have prevented these problems.\n\nIf some priests knew about the problems and kept it secret, that's wrong. But I don't think that's the case for all priests. \n\nI don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea at first, but I think many people were still upset after the 9/11 attacks. They used the 9/11 attacks as a reason to go to war in Iraq. But there were other reasons, not just the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe Bush administration said Saddam Hussein had arms of mass destruction, but this was not true. They connected Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks. This makes me very angry.\n\nThe Bush administration told many lies to the American people. They have not admitted to these lies. Colin Powell, a high official, said he was not sure about the evidence when he talked to the UN.\n\nI think this is very bad. It is against the law for government officials to lie. The Bush administration does not respect the law and the constitution. They have been trying to change the law since the 9/11 attacks.\n\nI think the Bush administration wanted to go to war from the beginning. The treasury secretary said this in a book. He said George Bush, the younger, wanted to go to war because his father was angry at Saddam Hussein. Bush wanted to increase the country's oil supply.\n\nThis is not a good way to make decisions. The war has lasted too long. If we leave now, there will be problems. The country might become very violent and many more people will die.\n\nThe UN and the US are trying to find a new way. They want a group of neighboring countries to help keep order. But this might not be a good idea. Iraq's freedom will be a big problem.\n\nThe news says the new government is not working well. The parliament is not effective and the prime minister does not have control. A man named Muqtada al-Sadr is still a problem. His party has many seats in the parliament.

            "I have thoughts about the war in Iraq. \n\nLet me think for a moment. \n\nIn my opinion, the war in Iraq is not very important. We did not declare war on Iraq officially. It seems like we went to war because we thought Iraq was involved in the 9/11 attacks. \n\nI am not very interested in the details of the war. But I know we are staying in Iraq to try to build a democracy. We also want to get oil from Iraq. \n\nBut I think we should not stay in Iraq. It makes many people unhappy. \n\nIf we stay, we will have to try to build democracy. This will take a long time. If we leave, the people in Iraq will be angry with us. They will have to start all over again. \n\nI do not know what to say about the war. It is a very difficult topic. \n\nI think the war in Iraq should continue, but it should not be called a war. We should not use guns to show that we are powerful. \n\nWe did not declare war on Iraq officially. A declared war needs the approval of Congress. \n\nI think we should try to help Iraq, but it is wasting our resources. It is also making President Bush look bad. \n\nThe Vietnam War was also an undeclared war. It is now called a meaningless war. \n\nI do not know what to say. It is hard to make a decision. \n\nThere are many families with sons and daughters in Iraq. I want them to be safe, but I also do not want to hurt the people of Iraq. \n\nIf we stay in Iraq, we will try to change their culture to be like ours. This will be bad for them. Their hate for the U.S. will grow, and the Al-Kaida group will get stronger. \n\nI think the war in Iraq will go on for a long time. It is a very complicated issue. \n\nThat is my opinion.",

This means the government should not control what churches do.\n\nThe constitution is clear on this. If we try to make a new law that says something is not allowed, it goes against what is already written. That is not right.\n\nSome people want to make it a law that one church's beliefs are more important than another's. Most Catholics and Christians do not agree with this idea. But it is not up to the government to decide what churches can or cannot do.\n\nThe separation of church and state is very important. It allows for freedom of religion in the United States. Some people want to change the constitution to make a new law. This would be wrong because it goes against what is already written.\n\nIt would be one of the only laws that restricts people, not the government. I don't think this is right.\n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this issue. The president is trying to make this law because it is against his own beliefs as a Catholic. This shows he has a preference for one religion over others. Churches should decide this, not the president or the government.\n\nThere is no good reason to make this law, except for personal opinions. It will not help the economy, and it may even help society.\n\nIn short, the government should not be involved in what churches do. The constitution is clear, and we should follow it.",
            "I want to talk about the war in Iraq.  The US government did not tell the American people the whole truth about why they wanted to go to war.  I think they used the attacks on September 11th to make people angry and want to fight.  But the two things were not connected.\n\nI am against war and especially going to war to attack first.  The war in Iraq was like the war in Vietnam.  The US should have learned from their mistakes in Vietnam.  In Vietnam, the US tried to put in a new government and it did not work.  Many American soldiers died in the war.\n\nThe US government took out the Iraqi government and wanted to put in a new one.  But they were not prepared for what would happen after that.  There was a lot of violence and chaos.  The US is still trying to help the Iraqis build a new government.\n\nI think the US government made a big mistake by going to war.  They did not plan for all the things that could happen.  The war has been going on for a long time and many American soldiers are still dying.  The US is trying to help the Iraqis learn to police their own country, but it is a slow process.\n\nI do not think the US government was honest with the American people about why they went to war.  They said it would be a short and easy war, but it has not been.  It takes a long time to build a new government and make it successful.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in a situation like this.  If the US went to war, they should finish what they started.  But we also have to think about the American soldiers who are dying.  Why are we helping Iraq and not other countries?  I think it is because of the oil in Iraq.\n\nThe US government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were not found.  We know North Korea has these weapons and we are not fighting them.  I do not think the US government is being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq.

You put something on the internet, and it affects how people think of you. If you talk about hurting people or things, someone will see it. \n\nThe internet is seen by everyone. If you are friends with someone on Myspace, you will see what they post. But it's not the school that sees it. Someone else sees it and tells the school.\n\nThe school must act on it. They can't ignore it in case something bad happens. They might be able to prevent it.\n\nBut it's hard to know what to take seriously. People sometimes joke online. Like what happened at my school.

They looked at the student's Facebook and found some things that might be jokes, but became serious in that situation.\n\nWhen you put something on the internet, there's no privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it. If you don't want someone to see it, don't post it.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on Myspace and Facebook.

            "I think the war has lasted too long. \n\nThe main reason was good at first - to give democracy to another country. \n\nBut now, I think we are fighting for different reasons.

We were involved in a disagreement with Saddam Hussein's country long ago. \n\nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country with no fair government, that would be a good reason.

            "I have a question about something. \n\nYou see, someone found out about this because they looked online. They went to a website and found some information. I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. If you put something on the internet, everyone can see it. \n\nOn a website called Myspace, you need to have a friend to see someone's profile. But when you accept someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see what you have on your profile. So, if you put something on the internet, many people may see it. \n\nI think it's good that someone found out about this. It may have saved a life. However, this is a problem. We can't have one person looking at everyone's online profiles all the time. That's not fair. \n\nWe can't have someone's job be to look at everyone's profiles. That would be wrong. But, it depends on the situation. If someone is looking for information to help someone, that's different. \n\nI have a Facebook account, but I don't have a Myspace account. I worry about people seeing things about me online. There are people who can get information easily. I saw a TV show about this. A man got a girl's screen name and was talking to her on instant messenger in a few minutes. \n\nIt's hard to protect your information online.

But it's hard because I want to be able to talk to my friends. \n\nI only accept people I know on Facebook. But you never know who can see what. My roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure if that was right. I don't know how the school had the right to tell students what to do.",
            "The Iraq War is a big issue. I want to talk about it again. \n\nSome people say I'm a hypocrite for talking about it. I was against the war at first. But now I think it's not very important. Most people in the world think the war was a bad idea. \n\nSurveys in the United States, Iraq, and many other countries show this. About 75 to 80 percent of people think the war was a bad idea. Even 80 percent of Iraqi people and 70 percent of US soldiers in Iraq think so. \n\nI think the war was a disaster from the start. It's hard to make good decisions when there's a big difference in culture between the US and the Middle East. \n\nWe tried to bring democracy to Iraq, but it's not what the people there wanted. Saddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the problems before going to war. \n\nNow, it's hard to find a good reason to stay in Iraq. I don't agree with the US government's ideas for staying there. If they want to leave slowly, I wouldn't be against that. But I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. \n\nMany Iraqis want us to leave. We're helping them, but they're telling us to go. I think they know what's best for their country. If we listen to them and leave, we won't be responsible if things get worse. \n\nIf we help Iraq again after we leave, we might be seen as good people. We're not good people in the Middle East now, but it will be better than how things are today.",
            "There is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. \n\nI think this is true in many workplaces. Women often face more difficulties because of a glass ceiling. This is like a barrier that prevents them from getting to a higher position. Even if there is equality, people often have trouble working under a woman.\n\nThis is because society has been this way for a long time. Many women see a job they can do well, but the board may not choose them for the position. This is because women are not often in important jobs.\n\nThe same thing happens to men and other groups. For example, men who stay at home to care for children are often looked down upon. Society thinks men should be the breadwinners. This can be hard on these men because they want to take care of their children.\n\nIn the fashion industry, many people do not take men seriously if they are interested in fashion. This is because men who like fashion are often different. People do not understand their style.\n\nI think there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing this is hard because society has a strong idea of how things should be. We have made progress, but it is slow. Women are now in important jobs and men are staying home to care for children. This is changing people's views.\n\nWe need to promote the good qualities of people who are often discriminated against. We should not push too hard, or people will resist. I think we are at a good point where this is happening slowly. I do not know if there is anything else we can do.\n\nPeople from different places and with different backgrounds also face discrimination. For example, someone from a farm may not have perfect grammar, but they can be very smart. They may get a job as a CEO, but other men may not respect them because of their grammar.\n\nThis is another example of how people are often judged unfairly.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana is not fully legal. But some places have made it not a crime. This means it is not a serious offense like a crime. It is more like a traffic ticket. You get cited and do not get arrested.\n\nIf you get a citation for marijuana, it can affect your future. This can make it harder to get a job. But some people say it is better to not make it a crime. This is because it costs a lot of money to arrest and put people in jail. Then the court has to deal with the case. This costs even more money.\n\nSome cities do not have enough money. They do not want to make this change. But some cities, like Denver, are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea. They have more money to spend on important things like education and helping the elderly.\n\nI think it is a good idea. But marijuana must be used carefully. It should not be everywhere. There are good reasons to be careful. If it is allowed everywhere, people might smoke and drive. This is not safe.\n\nMarijuana can affect people in different ways. Some people are more careful and do not get into trouble. Others are not so careful. Alcohol can also be a problem. It can affect people's ability to think and move.\n\nI think people react differently to substances like marijuana and alcohol. Some people can use them without trouble. Others get into trouble. We should be careful and think about how substances affect us.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nMany things they do are old customs. \nThey have done these things for a long time. \nIt's good to have old traditions. \nBut it's also important to change. \nMany Catholics think they must go to church every week. \nThey are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel the Catholic Church is not kind to people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian, but my mom was a Catholic. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry my parents because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not being kind to other religions. \nWe learned to love others in Catholic school. \nBut it seems hypocritical to love others and not accept them. \n\nI think the Catholic rules tell you to do things. \nBut the way Catholics act goes against the rules. \nThe rules are old and need to change. \nBut they continue to keep them. \n\nI do not think this would make priests behave better. \nSome people who hurt children will do that even if they are married. \nIt's because they are hurting children, not because they are not married. \nSo, allowing priests to be married would not stop this behavior. \n\nIn my opinion, people who hurt children will do it anyway. \nIt's not because of marriage.",
            "I am having trouble making a decision on this issue. I do not know if one side is right or wrong. This is a very difficult topic. \n\nThe separation of church and state is a problem. Also, defining marriage is hard. We do not want to upset anyone. \n\nI do not know if the government should decide what a marriage is. Marriage is sometimes a sacrament. People get tax breaks if they are married. \n\nIf two people are married, the government should look at it like a civil union. It is the same for everyone. The government should not consider what kind of marriage it is. \n\nI think gay marriage is like any other marriage. Two people want to be together. They should have a civil union. \n\nIf all states agree, they should make it a law for the country. But a constitutional change to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue. \n\nThis issue is not important enough to change the constitution. We do not need to change the constitution to stop gay marriage. \n\nNo, I do not think so.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. This makes me think about gay marriage in a confusing way. I have many friends who are gay. I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think gay marriage should be allowed. It is not a national issue. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nMany states are democratic or republican. Democratic states often support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know its opinion. You chose to live there. So, it's not your place to disagree with its decision. I think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already said this. But I will say it again. I do not think the president should decide for the whole country. George Bush is not in every state. He should not decide how each state runs itself. Some things should be left to each state. He will be out of office soon. If a new president allows gay marriage, it will change again. Each state should decide for itself. They are the ones who will live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Myspace is a public place on the internet. You can see what others post there. School officials have the right to check it. They can see what students post, even if it's not under the school's name. They can see it when they are at home.\n\nIf school officials check Myspace to stop students from hurting themselves or others, that's okay. It's their job to keep students safe. They want to make sure students are not doing anything bad.\n\nSome people think it's an invasion of privacy when school officials check Myspace. But if it makes the school a safer place, it's not an invasion. School officials are just doing their job.\n\nWhen you post something on the internet, anyone can see it. You can't take it back. That's why you have to be careful what you say online. School officials can't help but see what students post. They want to keep students safe.\n\nSchools have rules and drills to keep students safe. They practice what to do in case of an emergency. School officials check Myspace to make sure students are not doing anything bad. They want to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nIn this case, school officials were just trying to keep students safe. They checked Myspace to see if students were doing anything bad. They want to make sure students are safe in school.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea. I was affected by 9/11. I thought we should go to their country and stop their violence. But I think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term effects.\n\nWe went to their country without a plan. I think that was a bad idea. It didn't work out well for us. I don't think we helped them. They will fight with each other, and they can't fight with us if they're busy fighting themselves.\n\nI'm not interested in their problems. They can solve their own problems. I think they're a different kind of people when it comes to war. We think war is bad, but they see it as a way to get what they want.\n\nWe went to their country thinking we could change their country. But I don't think that's possible. They will always be the way they are. We should have thought before we acted. We should have made a plan.\n\nI think we went to their country for revenge. President Bush wanted to go because people were angry after 9/11. I think he made a mistake, but I understand why he did it. We couldn't just let them do what they did and then do nothing.\n\nWe should have had a clear plan to create order in their country. But we didn't. We didn't know what we were doing. We didn't work together. That would have helped us.\n\nI don't think we should stay in their country. We've made some progress, but not enough. If we leave, their country will collapse. We can't stay there forever. It's not good for us to stay there. We should leave and let them solve their own problems."
