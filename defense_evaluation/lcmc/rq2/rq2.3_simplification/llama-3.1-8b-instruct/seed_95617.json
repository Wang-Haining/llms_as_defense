            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church must make some changes. They have a problem with a lot of people not attending their church. I think this is because the Church is not very accepting of some things. \n\nFor example, they have strong views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views are a little old-fashioned. If the Church adapts to new ideas, they will not lose followers. Some people do not like the Church's views on these subjects. They think the Church is wrong.\n\nIf you are for abortion, you may not want to be part of a Church that says it is wrong. The same is true if you believe in gay marriage. You may not want to be in a Church that does not agree with you.\n\nI do not think it is a good reason that priests cannot be married or that women cannot be priests. Many people have jobs and families. Why can't priests? The Church says priests are married to God, but this is not the same as having a family. I do not see why priests cannot have both.",

Gay people should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nIt's not a choice to be gay or straight. People are born one or the other. My friend is gay. He did not choose to be gay. He is just born that way.\n\nI don't think the federal government should decide who can get married. It's not a matter of national security or morality.

            "I think gay marriage should be made legal. There's no good reason not to. \n\nMany people think homosexual couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. Each couple is different, and their problems are not the same as others. It's like two sides of the same coin – heads and tails are not the same. \n\nGay couples should have the same rights as everyone else. This includes things like paying taxes and getting medical care. If you're in a gay couple and you're sick, your partner can't be with you in the hospital. This is not fair.\n\nI think this is a silly rule. Many scientific studies have shown that gay couples are like straight couples. They have the same kinds of problems and the same kinds of successes. \n\nThe problem is, people get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. But gay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They want a marriage certificate, which is a legal document. \n\nIf a country allows people to have a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how children will be treated. They worry that gay couples will have problems with their community. They worry that children will be influenced by their parents' choices. But we don't know for sure. \n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they get bullied in public schools. This is not fair. Parents who protest to get the child removed from the school are not right. \n\nParenting skills are the same for gay couples as for straight couples. It's about personality, not about being gay or straight.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment against gay marriage is not fair. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, but they are based on his religion. His views on abortion and stem cell research are similar. I don't pay much attention to politics, but it seems that many people's reasons for not allowing gay marriage are based on morality. \n\nBut morality is different for everyone. It's not right to ignore the culture and morality of other people. The government should not make laws that enforce one group's religion on the whole country.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. People should listen to experts, not just their neighbors or friends. \n\nIf people listen to experts, they would see that gay people are not so different. They are just like everyone else.",

If people do not fear using it, they might use it correctly. \n\nMarijuana is not the same as alcohol. If people misuse alcohol, it can cause problems. But marijuana can be used responsibly. \n\nWe should remove the bad image of marijuana. People think it is bad because it is illegal.

It is only thirty minutes long. People wear casual clothes to church, even on Sundays. During the summer, some people wear beach clothes. Families often arrive late.\n\nI think this shows that the church has become more casual. Even on Sundays, people wear jeans and khakis. I think this is a big change.\n\nNow, I want to talk about the problems with Catholic priests and pedophilia. I don't think allowing priests to get married or being female would have prevented these problems. Some married men are still pedophiles. They still have a problem.\n\nWhen someone becomes a priest, it is their choice. They choose to become a priest. Some religions allow their priests to be married. But I think being married or not married does not make someone a pedophile.\n\nI think people are born with certain problems. They cannot choose to be a pedophile. Genetics may play a role in this.

The US went to war in Iraq for reasons that were not honest.\n\nThe Bush administration said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. They said he worked with Osama Bin Laden and caused the 9/11 attacks. But this was not true. They were lying to the American people.\n\nI think this is very bad. The Bush administration did not tell the truth. Even Colin Powell did not believe in the evidence. He said this after giving a big speech at the UN. He said he was not sure of the evidence at the time.\n\nThis is wrong. It is against the law for government officials to lie to the people. They did not respect the US Constitution. They did this since 9/11.\n\nThe Bush administration wanted to go to war. They planned it before they came into office. The Secretary of the Treasury said this in a book. He said the younger Bush wanted to go to war because of his father's past problems with Saddam Hussein. He also wanted to control Iraq's oil.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If the US leaves now, there could be a big problem. The country might fall apart and many more people would die. The US and the UN want to have other countries from the area help keep order in Iraq. But I am not sure this is a good idea. It could cause more problems in the long run.\n\nIraq will have trouble being in charge of itself. The government is not working well now.

I think this war started because the United States was angry after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. We thought Iraq was involved.\n\nI'm not very informed about this war. I don't know many details. But I think our goal is to help Iraq become a democracy like the United States. We also want their oil.\n\nStaying in Iraq makes people unhappy. If we stay, we have to build democracy, which takes a long time. If we leave, Iraq will be unhappy with us.\n\nI think this is a difficult decision. I don't know what to do. Do we stay and help Iraq? Or do we go home and let them start again?\n\nI'm not sure. I have many thoughts. One thing is clear: it's not fair to stay in Iraq forever. We should not call it a war because it was not officially declared.\n\nWe use guns to show our power. But is this the right reason to stay? I don't think so.\n\nI feel bad for President Bush. He's getting a bad name because of this war. It reminds me of the Vietnam War. That was an undeclared war and it didn't work out well.\n\nI have friends whose family members are in Iraq. I feel bad for them. But if we stay, we might be changing Iraq too much. They have their own culture, and we might make things worse.\n\nWe might be creating a bigger problem with Al-Kaida.

It allows for freedom of religion. Making a law about this would be wrong and go against what is already written in the Constitution.\n\nI think the government should not be involved in this issue.

            "There is much disagreement about the war in Iraq. I do not think the government was honest about the reasons for fighting. They said the war was connected to the attacks on September 11th. But this was not true. The government used this to get the support of the American people.\n\nI am against war. I do not think a preemptive attack is ever a good idea. The war in Iraq was like the war in Vietnam. The US government did not learn from its past mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government, but it was not prepared for the problems that followed.\n\nThe US tried to put a new government in Iraq. But this was not easy. It is always a long process to set up a new government. The US government made it seem easy, but it was not. Democracy is not an easy thing to create.\n\nIt is hard to make a decision about the war in Iraq. I have mixed feelings about it. In the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. He said he would finish what he started. But then I thought, how can we leave Iraq? We took away their government and their way of life. We must see it through, but at what cost? Many American soldiers have died.\n\nThe main reason for the war in Iraq was oil. The US wanted control of the oil. Another reason was that Iraq was said to have weapons of mass destruction. But no such weapons were found. We knew North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not attack them. This shows that the US government is not honest about its reasons for war.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But this is not likely.",

The internet is public, and everyone sees it.\n\nIf you are friends with someone on a website like MySpace, you will see what they post. But the school did not post the information.

It was to help another country gain democracy. \nBut now, I think we are fighting for other reasons. \nWe want to show the world that we are a strong country. \nI am not sure this is a good reason for war. \n\nI think the reason for the war was questionable from the start. \nGeorge Bush's father had problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf we wanted to help a country without a fair government, that would be a good reason. \nBut if there were personal reasons, it would not be fair. \n\nI think we made a point when we started the war. \nIt was a strong statement. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nThis is not good. \n\nIf we wanted to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that would be a good reason for war. \nBut I do not think our reason has been clear for a long time. \nWe seem to be fighting just to fight. \nWe do not want to end the war without winning. \n\nI think the war has lasted long enough. \nThe government of the other country should take care of itself. \nWe should not spend a lot of money on war. \nWe have our own problems to solve, like poverty and bad roads. \nWe need to spend money on these things. \n\nWe are spending a lot of money on war. \nIt is not good to spend a lot of money on war for a long time. \nWe should spend money on things that help our own people, like health care and education. \nNow, we are spending money to hurt our own people in a war we are losing. \n\nThis is my opinion.",
            "I have a question to ask for clarification.\n\nSomeone was able to stop something bad from happening because they found information on the internet. This person looked at Myspace, a website where people can share information. They found something that could have prevented a life from being lost.\n\nIt is true that information on the internet is open to many people. If you post something on Myspace, many people can see it. You must add someone as a friend for them to see your profile, but that means you have given them permission.\n\nWhen you put information on the internet, you must understand that many people will see it. I think it is good that someone saw the information and was able to stop something bad from happening.\n\nHowever, it is a problem to have one person watching all the students' profiles all the time. It is not fair to judge people based on what they post on the internet. It is not right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles all the time.\n\nIt depends on why someone looked at the profile. Were they looking for something important or just looking at people's profiles randomly?\n\nI have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people who can see things about me. I know that it is possible for people to get information easily. I saw a TV show about a man who got a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger. He got her to meet him in less than a minute.\n\nIt is hard to know who can see your information on the internet. You can limit what you put on the internet, but it is hard to make sure that only people you know can see it. The point of having a profile is to be able to communicate with friends.\n\nMy roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I am not sure how the school officials had the right to do that.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I know it's not easy for me to say this, but I was against it at first. Many people were. But now, it's not important to say I was against it from the start. The majority of people think it was a bad idea. \n\nIn the United States, Iraq, and all around the world, most people think the war was a mistake. About 75-80% of the world's population thinks so. In Iraq, 80% of the people think it was a bad idea. Even 70% of the U.S. troops in Iraq think the war was a mistake and want to leave within a year.\n\nThe war has been a disaster from the beginning. It's hard to fix things now. The problem is that the United States and Middle Eastern countries have very different cultures. It's hard for us to understand their way of life and bring democracy to their countries. We should consider what the people of Iraq really want, not just what our government thinks is best.\n\nSaddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought carefully before invading his country. We need to weigh the good and bad before making big decisions like that. We can see that the war has caused big problems and made things worse.\n\nI don't think our government has a good reason to stay in Iraq. We should leave now. If we leave slowly, it's okay, but I don't see a reason to stay any longer. Most Iraqis want us to leave, and they know what's best for their country. If we listen to them, it won't be our fault if things go badly. We can still help them after we leave, and it will be better for everyone.",
            "There is still a problem with women and men being treated unfairly in the United States. This is called gender discrimination.\n\nPeople are not equal everywhere. It depends on the job. Women often have a harder time. This is because society has a long history of men being in charge. Even when there is a law that says everyone is equal, it's hard to make it happen.\n\nImagine a glass ceiling that women can't break through. They have the skills and education to do a job, but they don't get the chance to do it. This happens when men are not used to working for women.\n\nIt's the same for men who stay at home with their children. Society doesn't understand this. They think men should be the ones earning money. If a man stays home, people might think he's not doing his job.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who like fashion are not always taken seriously. People think they don't know about fashion because of their style. But this is not true.\n\nChanging society is slow. We have come a long way, but we have a long way to go. We need to show people that women and men can do different things and be good at them. We can do this by talking about the good things people do, not by forcing people to accept them.\n\nIt's good that we're making progress, but we need to be careful. If we do things too fast, people might resist. We need to find a balance.\n\nPeople can be discriminated against because of where they're from or their job. If someone talks differently, they might be judged by others. This is not fair.\n\nIn conclusion, gender discrimination is a problem in the United States. We need to work together to make things more equal. We can do this by being kind and understanding, and by showing people that everyone can be good at different things.",
            "My understanding is that some places did not make marijuana a crime.  They made it a smaller problem, like a traffic ticket.  You get a fine, not arrested and taken to jail.  This makes some people happy.  But some people worry about the future.  They think a marijuana charge can still cause problems, even if it is not a crime.\n\nSome people say it costs too much money to arrest and try people for marijuana.  It costs money to take them to court and pay for lawyers.  So, some cities do not want to make marijuana a smaller problem.  They do not want to spend the money.\n\nBut some cities are okay with making marijuana a smaller problem.  Denver is one example.  People in Denver tend to be more open-minded.  This city now has more money to spend on important things like schools, food for the homeless, and help for the elderly.\n\nIt is a good idea to make marijuana a smaller problem.  But it is also true that marijuana can be a problem.  If people can buy it anywhere, they might smoke it while driving.  Smoking marijuana is not accepted in many places.  Some people do not want to see it everywhere.\n\nAlcohol can also cause problems.  It can affect how people drive and make decisions.  Marijuana can affect how people live their lives.  People react to substances differently.  Some people can use them without problems, but others cannot.\n\nSo, it is hard to say what to do about marijuana.  But it is true that both marijuana and alcohol can cause problems.  We need to be careful and think about how to use them.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nTraditional things are very important. \nThey have been done this way for a long time. \nIt is good to be connected to the past. \nBut it is also important to be able to change. \nI think this is true. \n\nMany Catholics go to church every week. \nThey do things a certain way. \nI feel that the Catholic Church does not accept people who do not follow its rules very well. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \nThis happened to my parents. \nMy mom was a Catholic and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThey could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \n\nThe Catholic Church teaches us to love others. \nBut it does not practice what it preaches. \nThis is because some of its old rules are not good. \nThe Church keeps these rules anyway. \n\nI do not think that allowing priests to marry would make a difference. \nSome people who do bad things will do them anyway. \nThey will hurt children, no matter if they are married or not. \nThis is a big problem. \n\nWe should focus on stopping people from hurting children. \nAllowing priests to marry will not solve this problem. \nWe need to find other ways to stop this from happening.",
            "I'm not sure about this issue yet.  \nI don't know if one side is right or wrong.  \nThis is a very difficult problem we face now.  \nIt's hard to decide when the line between church and state is unclear.  \nAlso, defining marriage is a very hard job because it can offend people.  \n\nI don't know if marriage should be decided by the government.  \nSome people think it's a special ceremony, like a sacrament.  \nIf that's true, then people in a marriage could get tax breaks.  \nOr they could get special treatment from the government because they were baptized.  \nBut I think the government should just look at marriage as a civil union.  \nIt's a union between two people, and that's all.  \n\nThey shouldn't ask what kind of marriage it is or what church the couple belongs to.  \nIt's just two people who are together.  \nThe issue of gay marriage is similar.  \nIt's just two people who are in a union.  \n\nIf all the states can agree on this, then they should make it a federal law.  \nBut making a constitutional amendment to stop gay marriage is not right.  \nThe constitution should not be changed just because many people don't like it.  \nIt's not important enough to change the constitution over.  \nWe just need to accept that marriage is between two people who love each other.  \n\nNo, I don't think the constitution should be changed for this reason.",
            "I grew up in a Christian family. For me, homosexuality is a complicated issue. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with all parts of the gay lifestyle. But I think it should be legal. I do not think it is a national problem. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are Republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how the state feels about this issue. I do not think you can disagree with a state's decision if it decides to allow gay marriage. You chose to live there.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. So, each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already said this. I do not think the president should decide what is best for every state. George Bush does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state runs itself.\n\nSome things should be decided by each state. George Bush will not be president for much longer. If a new president wants to allow gay marriage, the law might change. But that is not necessary. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nNo, I do not agree with that. I think each state should make its own decision about gay marriage.",
            "I think school officials have the right to see what students are posting on the internet. Myspace is a public place where people share things for everyone to see. If you post something on the internet, you have to be ready for anyone to see it, including school officials.\n\nEven if you don't put the school's name on it, they can still find it if they want to. They can use their computers at home to look for it. The school officials' job is to keep students safe. If they find something that can help them do this, I think it's okay for them to look at it.\n\nFor example, if they go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking, I think that's okay. It's their job to keep the school safe and make sure students are not breaking the rules.\n\nBut if they just go on the internet to catch students and get them in trouble, I think that's not right. It's an invasion of privacy. However, if they find something that helps them keep the school safe, I think it's okay.\n\nSome people might think it's not right for school officials to look at what students are posting on the internet. But I think it's okay as long as it helps keep the school safe. We had lock-down drills in my school to prepare for emergencies. It's like the school officials are doing the same thing, trying to keep the school safe.\n\nThey are not trying to catch students; they are trying to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting. We had a shooting at Columbine High School, and it was very sad. So, I think school officials are doing the right thing by looking at what students are posting on the internet.\n\nWe have to be careful about what we post on the internet because it can come back and hurt us. It's like a big record of everything we do. If we say or do something bad when we're a student, it can come back and cause problems when we're older. It's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nSo, I think school officials are okay to look at what students are posting on the internet if it helps them keep the school safe. But they should not just look for ways to catch students. They should look for ways to help the school and keep everyone safe.",
            "I want to talk about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea. I was personally affected by 9/11. I wanted to go to that country and make them feel what we felt after 9/11.\n\nHowever, I think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term effects of our actions. We went to war without a plan. This was a big mistake.\n\nI was for the war at first, but now I am against it. I don't think it helped. The people in that country are fighting with each other. They can't fight with us if they can't even get along with themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 changed my feelings about that country. I don't care what happens there anymore. I think they are not very nice people when it comes to war. They just want to fight. They don't want to make their country better.\n\nI think we went to war for revenge, not a good reason. We were angry and wanted to fight back. We didn't think about what could happen. President Bush decided to go to war with Iraq. I understand why he did it, but I think we should have had a better plan.\n\nWe didn't have unity and clarity about what we wanted to do in that country. We didn't think about how to create order. I think this would have helped us a lot.\n\nI don't think we can change those people. They will always be the same. We are not helping them by staying there. We are just hurting ourselves. We can't stay in that country forever. When we leave, it will collapse. I think we should leave now."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church must make some changes. They have a problem with a lot of people not attending their church. I think this is because the Church is not very accepting of some things. \n\nFor example, they have strong views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views are a little old-fashioned. If the Church adapts to new ideas, they will not lose followers. Some people do not like the Church's views on these subjects. They think the Church is wrong.\n\nIf you are for abortion, you may not want to be part of a Church that says it is wrong. The same is true if you believe in gay marriage. You may not want to be in a Church that does not agree with you.\n\nI do not think it is a good reason that priests cannot be married or that women cannot be priests. Many people have jobs and families. Why can't priests? The Church says priests are married to God, but this is not the same as having a family. I do not see why priests cannot have both.",

Gay people should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nIt's not a choice to be gay or straight. People are born one or the other. My friend is gay. He did not choose to be gay. He is just born that way.\n\nI don't think the federal government should decide who can get married. It's not a matter of national security or morality.

            "I think gay marriage should be made legal. There's no good reason not to. \n\nMany people think homosexual couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. Each couple is different, and their problems are not the same as others. It's like two sides of the same coin – heads and tails are not the same. \n\nGay couples should have the same rights as everyone else. This includes things like paying taxes and getting medical care. If you're in a gay couple and you're sick, your partner can't be with you in the hospital. This is not fair.\n\nI think this is a silly rule. Many scientific studies have shown that gay couples are like straight couples. They have the same kinds of problems and the same kinds of successes. \n\nThe problem is, people get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. But gay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They want a marriage certificate, which is a legal document. \n\nIf a country allows people to have a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how children will be treated. They worry that gay couples will have problems with their community. They worry that children will be influenced by their parents' choices. But we don't know for sure. \n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they get bullied in public schools. This is not fair. Parents who protest to get the child removed from the school are not right. \n\nParenting skills are the same for gay couples as for straight couples. It's about personality, not about being gay or straight.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment against gay marriage is not fair. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, but they are based on his religion. His views on abortion and stem cell research are similar. I don't pay much attention to politics, but it seems that many people's reasons for not allowing gay marriage are based on morality. \n\nBut morality is different for everyone. It's not right to ignore the culture and morality of other people. The government should not make laws that enforce one group's religion on the whole country.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. People should listen to experts, not just their neighbors or friends. \n\nIf people listen to experts, they would see that gay people are not so different. They are just like everyone else.",

If people do not fear using it, they might use it correctly. \n\nMarijuana is not the same as alcohol. If people misuse alcohol, it can cause problems. But marijuana can be used responsibly. \n\nWe should remove the bad image of marijuana. People think it is bad because it is illegal.

It is only thirty minutes long. People wear casual clothes to church, even on Sundays. During the summer, some people wear beach clothes. Families often arrive late.\n\nI think this shows that the church has become more casual. Even on Sundays, people wear jeans and khakis. I think this is a big change.\n\nNow, I want to talk about the problems with Catholic priests and pedophilia. I don't think allowing priests to get married or being female would have prevented these problems. Some married men are still pedophiles. They still have a problem.\n\nWhen someone becomes a priest, it is their choice. They choose to become a priest. Some religions allow their priests to be married. But I think being married or not married does not make someone a pedophile.\n\nI think people are born with certain problems. They cannot choose to be a pedophile. Genetics may play a role in this.

The US went to war in Iraq for reasons that were not honest.\n\nThe Bush administration said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. They said he worked with Osama Bin Laden and caused the 9/11 attacks. But this was not true. They were lying to the American people.\n\nI think this is very bad. The Bush administration did not tell the truth. Even Colin Powell did not believe in the evidence. He said this after giving a big speech at the UN. He said he was not sure of the evidence at the time.\n\nThis is wrong. It is against the law for government officials to lie to the people. They did not respect the US Constitution. They did this since 9/11.\n\nThe Bush administration wanted to go to war. They planned it before they came into office. The Secretary of the Treasury said this in a book. He said the younger Bush wanted to go to war because of his father's past problems with Saddam Hussein. He also wanted to control Iraq's oil.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If the US leaves now, there could be a big problem. The country might fall apart and many more people would die. The US and the UN want to have other countries from the area help keep order in Iraq. But I am not sure this is a good idea. It could cause more problems in the long run.\n\nIraq will have trouble being in charge of itself. The government is not working well now.

I think this war started because the United States was angry after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. We thought Iraq was involved.\n\nI'm not very informed about this war. I don't know many details. But I think our goal is to help Iraq become a democracy like the United States. We also want their oil.\n\nStaying in Iraq makes people unhappy. If we stay, we have to build democracy, which takes a long time. If we leave, Iraq will be unhappy with us.\n\nI think this is a difficult decision. I don't know what to do. Do we stay and help Iraq? Or do we go home and let them start again?\n\nI'm not sure. I have many thoughts. One thing is clear: it's not fair to stay in Iraq forever. We should not call it a war because it was not officially declared.\n\nWe use guns to show our power. But is this the right reason to stay? I don't think so.\n\nI feel bad for President Bush. He's getting a bad name because of this war. It reminds me of the Vietnam War. That was an undeclared war and it didn't work out well.\n\nI have friends whose family members are in Iraq. I feel bad for them. But if we stay, we might be changing Iraq too much. They have their own culture, and we might make things worse.\n\nWe might be creating a bigger problem with Al-Kaida.

It allows for freedom of religion. Making a law about this would be wrong and go against what is already written in the Constitution.\n\nI think the government should not be involved in this issue.

            "There is much disagreement about the war in Iraq. I do not think the government was honest about the reasons for fighting. They said the war was connected to the attacks on September 11th. But this was not true. The government used this to get the support of the American people.\n\nI am against war. I do not think a preemptive attack is ever a good idea. The war in Iraq was like the war in Vietnam. The US government did not learn from its past mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government, but it was not prepared for the problems that followed.\n\nThe US tried to put a new government in Iraq. But this was not easy. It is always a long process to set up a new government. The US government made it seem easy, but it was not. Democracy is not an easy thing to create.\n\nIt is hard to make a decision about the war in Iraq. I have mixed feelings about it. In the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. He said he would finish what he started. But then I thought, how can we leave Iraq? We took away their government and their way of life. We must see it through, but at what cost? Many American soldiers have died.\n\nThe main reason for the war in Iraq was oil. The US wanted control of the oil. Another reason was that Iraq was said to have weapons of mass destruction. But no such weapons were found. We knew North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not attack them. This shows that the US government is not honest about its reasons for war.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But this is not likely.",

The internet is public, and everyone sees it.\n\nIf you are friends with someone on a website like MySpace, you will see what they post. But the school did not post the information.

It was to help another country gain democracy. \nBut now, I think we are fighting for other reasons. \nWe want to show the world that we are a strong country. \nI am not sure this is a good reason for war. \n\nI think the reason for the war was questionable from the start. \nGeorge Bush's father had problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf we wanted to help a country without a fair government, that would be a good reason. \nBut if there were personal reasons, it would not be fair. \n\nI think we made a point when we started the war. \nIt was a strong statement. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nThis is not good. \n\nIf we wanted to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that would be a good reason for war. \nBut I do not think our reason has been clear for a long time. \nWe seem to be fighting just to fight. \nWe do not want to end the war without winning. \n\nI think the war has lasted long enough. \nThe government of the other country should take care of itself. \nWe should not spend a lot of money on war. \nWe have our own problems to solve, like poverty and bad roads. \nWe need to spend money on these things. \n\nWe are spending a lot of money on war. \nIt is not good to spend a lot of money on war for a long time. \nWe should spend money on things that help our own people, like health care and education. \nNow, we are spending money to hurt our own people in a war we are losing. \n\nThis is my opinion.",
            "I have a question to ask for clarification.\n\nSomeone was able to stop something bad from happening because they found information on the internet. This person looked at Myspace, a website where people can share information. They found something that could have prevented a life from being lost.\n\nIt is true that information on the internet is open to many people. If you post something on Myspace, many people can see it. You must add someone as a friend for them to see your profile, but that means you have given them permission.\n\nWhen you put information on the internet, you must understand that many people will see it. I think it is good that someone saw the information and was able to stop something bad from happening.\n\nHowever, it is a problem to have one person watching all the students' profiles all the time. It is not fair to judge people based on what they post on the internet. It is not right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles all the time.\n\nIt depends on why someone looked at the profile. Were they looking for something important or just looking at people's profiles randomly?\n\nI have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people who can see things about me. I know that it is possible for people to get information easily. I saw a TV show about a man who got a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger. He got her to meet him in less than a minute.\n\nIt is hard to know who can see your information on the internet. You can limit what you put on the internet, but it is hard to make sure that only people you know can see it. The point of having a profile is to be able to communicate with friends.\n\nMy roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I am not sure how the school officials had the right to do that.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I know it's not easy for me to say this, but I was against it at first. Many people were. But now, it's not important to say I was against it from the start. The majority of people think it was a bad idea. \n\nIn the United States, Iraq, and all around the world, most people think the war was a mistake. About 75-80% of the world's population thinks so. In Iraq, 80% of the people think it was a bad idea. Even 70% of the U.S. troops in Iraq think the war was a mistake and want to leave within a year.\n\nThe war has been a disaster from the beginning. It's hard to fix things now. The problem is that the United States and Middle Eastern countries have very different cultures. It's hard for us to understand their way of life and bring democracy to their countries. We should consider what the people of Iraq really want, not just what our government thinks is best.\n\nSaddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought carefully before invading his country. We need to weigh the good and bad before making big decisions like that. We can see that the war has caused big problems and made things worse.\n\nI don't think our government has a good reason to stay in Iraq. We should leave now. If we leave slowly, it's okay, but I don't see a reason to stay any longer. Most Iraqis want us to leave, and they know what's best for their country. If we listen to them, it won't be our fault if things go badly. We can still help them after we leave, and it will be better for everyone.",
            "There is still a problem with women and men being treated unfairly in the United States. This is called gender discrimination.\n\nPeople are not equal everywhere. It depends on the job. Women often have a harder time. This is because society has a long history of men being in charge. Even when there is a law that says everyone is equal, it's hard to make it happen.\n\nImagine a glass ceiling that women can't break through. They have the skills and education to do a job, but they don't get the chance to do it. This happens when men are not used to working for women.\n\nIt's the same for men who stay at home with their children. Society doesn't understand this. They think men should be the ones earning money. If a man stays home, people might think he's not doing his job.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who like fashion are not always taken seriously. People think they don't know about fashion because of their style. But this is not true.\n\nChanging society is slow. We have come a long way, but we have a long way to go. We need to show people that women and men can do different things and be good at them. We can do this by talking about the good things people do, not by forcing people to accept them.\n\nIt's good that we're making progress, but we need to be careful. If we do things too fast, people might resist. We need to find a balance.\n\nPeople can be discriminated against because of where they're from or their job. If someone talks differently, they might be judged by others. This is not fair.\n\nIn conclusion, gender discrimination is a problem in the United States. We need to work together to make things more equal. We can do this by being kind and understanding, and by showing people that everyone can be good at different things.",
            "My understanding is that some places did not make marijuana a crime.  They made it a smaller problem, like a traffic ticket.  You get a fine, not arrested and taken to jail.  This makes some people happy.  But some people worry about the future.  They think a marijuana charge can still cause problems, even if it is not a crime.\n\nSome people say it costs too much money to arrest and try people for marijuana.  It costs money to take them to court and pay for lawyers.  So, some cities do not want to make marijuana a smaller problem.  They do not want to spend the money.\n\nBut some cities are okay with making marijuana a smaller problem.  Denver is one example.  People in Denver tend to be more open-minded.  This city now has more money to spend on important things like schools, food for the homeless, and help for the elderly.\n\nIt is a good idea to make marijuana a smaller problem.  But it is also true that marijuana can be a problem.  If people can buy it anywhere, they might smoke it while driving.  Smoking marijuana is not accepted in many places.  Some people do not want to see it everywhere.\n\nAlcohol can also cause problems.  It can affect how people drive and make decisions.  Marijuana can affect how people live their lives.  People react to substances differently.  Some people can use them without problems, but others cannot.\n\nSo, it is hard to say what to do about marijuana.  But it is true that both marijuana and alcohol can cause problems.  We need to be careful and think about how to use them.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nTraditional things are very important. \nThey have been done this way for a long time. \nIt is good to be connected to the past. \nBut it is also important to be able to change. \nI think this is true. \n\nMany Catholics go to church every week. \nThey do things a certain way. \nI feel that the Catholic Church does not accept people who do not follow its rules very well. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \nThis happened to my parents. \nMy mom was a Catholic and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThey could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \n\nThe Catholic Church teaches us to love others. \nBut it does not practice what it preaches. \nThis is because some of its old rules are not good. \nThe Church keeps these rules anyway. \n\nI do not think that allowing priests to marry would make a difference. \nSome people who do bad things will do them anyway. \nThey will hurt children, no matter if they are married or not. \nThis is a big problem. \n\nWe should focus on stopping people from hurting children. \nAllowing priests to marry will not solve this problem. \nWe need to find other ways to stop this from happening.",
            "I'm not sure about this issue yet.  \nI don't know if one side is right or wrong.  \nThis is a very difficult problem we face now.  \nIt's hard to decide when the line between church and state is unclear.  \nAlso, defining marriage is a very hard job because it can offend people.  \n\nI don't know if marriage should be decided by the government.  \nSome people think it's a special ceremony, like a sacrament.  \nIf that's true, then people in a marriage could get tax breaks.  \nOr they could get special treatment from the government because they were baptized.  \nBut I think the government should just look at marriage as a civil union.  \nIt's a union between two people, and that's all.  \n\nThey shouldn't ask what kind of marriage it is or what church the couple belongs to.  \nIt's just two people who are together.  \nThe issue of gay marriage is similar.  \nIt's just two people who are in a union.  \n\nIf all the states can agree on this, then they should make it a federal law.  \nBut making a constitutional amendment to stop gay marriage is not right.  \nThe constitution should not be changed just because many people don't like it.  \nIt's not important enough to change the constitution over.  \nWe just need to accept that marriage is between two people who love each other.  \n\nNo, I don't think the constitution should be changed for this reason.",
            "I grew up in a Christian family. For me, homosexuality is a complicated issue. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with all parts of the gay lifestyle. But I think it should be legal. I do not think it is a national problem. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are Republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how the state feels about this issue. I do not think you can disagree with a state's decision if it decides to allow gay marriage. You chose to live there.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. So, each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already said this. I do not think the president should decide what is best for every state. George Bush does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state runs itself.\n\nSome things should be decided by each state. George Bush will not be president for much longer. If a new president wants to allow gay marriage, the law might change. But that is not necessary. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nNo, I do not agree with that. I think each state should make its own decision about gay marriage.",
            "I think school officials have the right to see what students are posting on the internet. Myspace is a public place where people share things for everyone to see. If you post something on the internet, you have to be ready for anyone to see it, including school officials.\n\nEven if you don't put the school's name on it, they can still find it if they want to. They can use their computers at home to look for it. The school officials' job is to keep students safe. If they find something that can help them do this, I think it's okay for them to look at it.\n\nFor example, if they go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking, I think that's okay. It's their job to keep the school safe and make sure students are not breaking the rules.\n\nBut if they just go on the internet to catch students and get them in trouble, I think that's not right. It's an invasion of privacy. However, if they find something that helps them keep the school safe, I think it's okay.\n\nSome people might think it's not right for school officials to look at what students are posting on the internet. But I think it's okay as long as it helps keep the school safe. We had lock-down drills in my school to prepare for emergencies. It's like the school officials are doing the same thing, trying to keep the school safe.\n\nThey are not trying to catch students; they are trying to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting. We had a shooting at Columbine High School, and it was very sad. So, I think school officials are doing the right thing by looking at what students are posting on the internet.\n\nWe have to be careful about what we post on the internet because it can come back and hurt us. It's like a big record of everything we do. If we say or do something bad when we're a student, it can come back and cause problems when we're older. It's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nSo, I think school officials are okay to look at what students are posting on the internet if it helps them keep the school safe. But they should not just look for ways to catch students. They should look for ways to help the school and keep everyone safe.",
            "I want to talk about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea. I was personally affected by 9/11. I wanted to go to that country and make them feel what we felt after 9/11.\n\nHowever, I think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term effects of our actions. We went to war without a plan. This was a big mistake.\n\nI was for the war at first, but now I am against it. I don't think it helped. The people in that country are fighting with each other. They can't fight with us if they can't even get along with themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 changed my feelings about that country. I don't care what happens there anymore. I think they are not very nice people when it comes to war. They just want to fight. They don't want to make their country better.\n\nI think we went to war for revenge, not a good reason. We were angry and wanted to fight back. We didn't think about what could happen. President Bush decided to go to war with Iraq. I understand why he did it, but I think we should have had a better plan.\n\nWe didn't have unity and clarity about what we wanted to do in that country. We didn't think about how to create order. I think this would have helped us a lot.\n\nI don't think we can change those people. They will always be the same. We are not helping them by staying there. We are just hurting ourselves. We can't stay in that country forever. When we leave, it will collapse. I think we should leave now."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church must make some changes. They have a problem with a lot of people not attending their church. I think this is because the Church is not very accepting of some things. \n\nFor example, they have strong views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views are a little old-fashioned. If the Church adapts to new ideas, they will not lose followers. Some people do not like the Church's views on these subjects. They think the Church is wrong.\n\nIf you are for abortion, you may not want to be part of a Church that says it is wrong. The same is true if you believe in gay marriage. You may not want to be in a Church that does not agree with you.\n\nI do not think it is a good reason that priests cannot be married or that women cannot be priests. Many people have jobs and families. Why can't priests? The Church says priests are married to God, but this is not the same as having a family. I do not see why priests cannot have both.",

Gay people should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nIt's not a choice to be gay or straight. People are born one or the other. My friend is gay. He did not choose to be gay. He is just born that way.\n\nI don't think the federal government should decide who can get married. It's not a matter of national security or morality.

            "I think gay marriage should be made legal. There's no good reason not to. \n\nMany people think homosexual couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. Each couple is different, and their problems are not the same as others. It's like two sides of the same coin – heads and tails are not the same. \n\nGay couples should have the same rights as everyone else. This includes things like paying taxes and getting medical care. If you're in a gay couple and you're sick, your partner can't be with you in the hospital. This is not fair.\n\nI think this is a silly rule. Many scientific studies have shown that gay couples are like straight couples. They have the same kinds of problems and the same kinds of successes. \n\nThe problem is, people get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. But gay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They want a marriage certificate, which is a legal document. \n\nIf a country allows people to have a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how children will be treated. They worry that gay couples will have problems with their community. They worry that children will be influenced by their parents' choices. But we don't know for sure. \n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they get bullied in public schools. This is not fair. Parents who protest to get the child removed from the school are not right. \n\nParenting skills are the same for gay couples as for straight couples. It's about personality, not about being gay or straight.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment against gay marriage is not fair. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, but they are based on his religion. His views on abortion and stem cell research are similar. I don't pay much attention to politics, but it seems that many people's reasons for not allowing gay marriage are based on morality. \n\nBut morality is different for everyone. It's not right to ignore the culture and morality of other people. The government should not make laws that enforce one group's religion on the whole country.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. People should listen to experts, not just their neighbors or friends. \n\nIf people listen to experts, they would see that gay people are not so different. They are just like everyone else.",

If people do not fear using it, they might use it correctly. \n\nMarijuana is not the same as alcohol. If people misuse alcohol, it can cause problems. But marijuana can be used responsibly. \n\nWe should remove the bad image of marijuana. People think it is bad because it is illegal.

It is only thirty minutes long. People wear casual clothes to church, even on Sundays. During the summer, some people wear beach clothes. Families often arrive late.\n\nI think this shows that the church has become more casual. Even on Sundays, people wear jeans and khakis. I think this is a big change.\n\nNow, I want to talk about the problems with Catholic priests and pedophilia. I don't think allowing priests to get married or being female would have prevented these problems. Some married men are still pedophiles. They still have a problem.\n\nWhen someone becomes a priest, it is their choice. They choose to become a priest. Some religions allow their priests to be married. But I think being married or not married does not make someone a pedophile.\n\nI think people are born with certain problems. They cannot choose to be a pedophile. Genetics may play a role in this.

The US went to war in Iraq for reasons that were not honest.\n\nThe Bush administration said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. They said he worked with Osama Bin Laden and caused the 9/11 attacks. But this was not true. They were lying to the American people.\n\nI think this is very bad. The Bush administration did not tell the truth. Even Colin Powell did not believe in the evidence. He said this after giving a big speech at the UN. He said he was not sure of the evidence at the time.\n\nThis is wrong. It is against the law for government officials to lie to the people. They did not respect the US Constitution. They did this since 9/11.\n\nThe Bush administration wanted to go to war. They planned it before they came into office. The Secretary of the Treasury said this in a book. He said the younger Bush wanted to go to war because of his father's past problems with Saddam Hussein. He also wanted to control Iraq's oil.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If the US leaves now, there could be a big problem. The country might fall apart and many more people would die. The US and the UN want to have other countries from the area help keep order in Iraq. But I am not sure this is a good idea. It could cause more problems in the long run.\n\nIraq will have trouble being in charge of itself. The government is not working well now.

I think this war started because the United States was angry after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. We thought Iraq was involved.\n\nI'm not very informed about this war. I don't know many details. But I think our goal is to help Iraq become a democracy like the United States. We also want their oil.\n\nStaying in Iraq makes people unhappy. If we stay, we have to build democracy, which takes a long time. If we leave, Iraq will be unhappy with us.\n\nI think this is a difficult decision. I don't know what to do. Do we stay and help Iraq? Or do we go home and let them start again?\n\nI'm not sure. I have many thoughts. One thing is clear: it's not fair to stay in Iraq forever. We should not call it a war because it was not officially declared.\n\nWe use guns to show our power. But is this the right reason to stay? I don't think so.\n\nI feel bad for President Bush. He's getting a bad name because of this war. It reminds me of the Vietnam War. That was an undeclared war and it didn't work out well.\n\nI have friends whose family members are in Iraq. I feel bad for them. But if we stay, we might be changing Iraq too much. They have their own culture, and we might make things worse.\n\nWe might be creating a bigger problem with Al-Kaida.

It allows for freedom of religion. Making a law about this would be wrong and go against what is already written in the Constitution.\n\nI think the government should not be involved in this issue.

            "There is much disagreement about the war in Iraq. I do not think the government was honest about the reasons for fighting. They said the war was connected to the attacks on September 11th. But this was not true. The government used this to get the support of the American people.\n\nI am against war. I do not think a preemptive attack is ever a good idea. The war in Iraq was like the war in Vietnam. The US government did not learn from its past mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government, but it was not prepared for the problems that followed.\n\nThe US tried to put a new government in Iraq. But this was not easy. It is always a long process to set up a new government. The US government made it seem easy, but it was not. Democracy is not an easy thing to create.\n\nIt is hard to make a decision about the war in Iraq. I have mixed feelings about it. In the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. He said he would finish what he started. But then I thought, how can we leave Iraq? We took away their government and their way of life. We must see it through, but at what cost? Many American soldiers have died.\n\nThe main reason for the war in Iraq was oil. The US wanted control of the oil. Another reason was that Iraq was said to have weapons of mass destruction. But no such weapons were found. We knew North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not attack them. This shows that the US government is not honest about its reasons for war.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But this is not likely.",

The internet is public, and everyone sees it.\n\nIf you are friends with someone on a website like MySpace, you will see what they post. But the school did not post the information.

It was to help another country gain democracy. \nBut now, I think we are fighting for other reasons. \nWe want to show the world that we are a strong country. \nI am not sure this is a good reason for war. \n\nI think the reason for the war was questionable from the start. \nGeorge Bush's father had problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf we wanted to help a country without a fair government, that would be a good reason. \nBut if there were personal reasons, it would not be fair. \n\nI think we made a point when we started the war. \nIt was a strong statement. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nThis is not good. \n\nIf we wanted to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that would be a good reason for war. \nBut I do not think our reason has been clear for a long time. \nWe seem to be fighting just to fight. \nWe do not want to end the war without winning. \n\nI think the war has lasted long enough. \nThe government of the other country should take care of itself. \nWe should not spend a lot of money on war. \nWe have our own problems to solve, like poverty and bad roads. \nWe need to spend money on these things. \n\nWe are spending a lot of money on war. \nIt is not good to spend a lot of money on war for a long time. \nWe should spend money on things that help our own people, like health care and education. \nNow, we are spending money to hurt our own people in a war we are losing. \n\nThis is my opinion.",
            "I have a question to ask for clarification.\n\nSomeone was able to stop something bad from happening because they found information on the internet. This person looked at Myspace, a website where people can share information. They found something that could have prevented a life from being lost.\n\nIt is true that information on the internet is open to many people. If you post something on Myspace, many people can see it. You must add someone as a friend for them to see your profile, but that means you have given them permission.\n\nWhen you put information on the internet, you must understand that many people will see it. I think it is good that someone saw the information and was able to stop something bad from happening.\n\nHowever, it is a problem to have one person watching all the students' profiles all the time. It is not fair to judge people based on what they post on the internet. It is not right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles all the time.\n\nIt depends on why someone looked at the profile. Were they looking for something important or just looking at people's profiles randomly?\n\nI have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people who can see things about me. I know that it is possible for people to get information easily. I saw a TV show about a man who got a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger. He got her to meet him in less than a minute.\n\nIt is hard to know who can see your information on the internet. You can limit what you put on the internet, but it is hard to make sure that only people you know can see it. The point of having a profile is to be able to communicate with friends.\n\nMy roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I am not sure how the school officials had the right to do that.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I know it's not easy for me to say this, but I was against it at first. Many people were. But now, it's not important to say I was against it from the start. The majority of people think it was a bad idea. \n\nIn the United States, Iraq, and all around the world, most people think the war was a mistake. About 75-80% of the world's population thinks so. In Iraq, 80% of the people think it was a bad idea. Even 70% of the U.S. troops in Iraq think the war was a mistake and want to leave within a year.\n\nThe war has been a disaster from the beginning. It's hard to fix things now. The problem is that the United States and Middle Eastern countries have very different cultures. It's hard for us to understand their way of life and bring democracy to their countries. We should consider what the people of Iraq really want, not just what our government thinks is best.\n\nSaddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought carefully before invading his country. We need to weigh the good and bad before making big decisions like that. We can see that the war has caused big problems and made things worse.\n\nI don't think our government has a good reason to stay in Iraq. We should leave now. If we leave slowly, it's okay, but I don't see a reason to stay any longer. Most Iraqis want us to leave, and they know what's best for their country. If we listen to them, it won't be our fault if things go badly. We can still help them after we leave, and it will be better for everyone.",
            "There is still a problem with women and men being treated unfairly in the United States. This is called gender discrimination.\n\nPeople are not equal everywhere. It depends on the job. Women often have a harder time. This is because society has a long history of men being in charge. Even when there is a law that says everyone is equal, it's hard to make it happen.\n\nImagine a glass ceiling that women can't break through. They have the skills and education to do a job, but they don't get the chance to do it. This happens when men are not used to working for women.\n\nIt's the same for men who stay at home with their children. Society doesn't understand this. They think men should be the ones earning money. If a man stays home, people might think he's not doing his job.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who like fashion are not always taken seriously. People think they don't know about fashion because of their style. But this is not true.\n\nChanging society is slow. We have come a long way, but we have a long way to go. We need to show people that women and men can do different things and be good at them. We can do this by talking about the good things people do, not by forcing people to accept them.\n\nIt's good that we're making progress, but we need to be careful. If we do things too fast, people might resist. We need to find a balance.\n\nPeople can be discriminated against because of where they're from or their job. If someone talks differently, they might be judged by others. This is not fair.\n\nIn conclusion, gender discrimination is a problem in the United States. We need to work together to make things more equal. We can do this by being kind and understanding, and by showing people that everyone can be good at different things.",
            "My understanding is that some places did not make marijuana a crime.  They made it a smaller problem, like a traffic ticket.  You get a fine, not arrested and taken to jail.  This makes some people happy.  But some people worry about the future.  They think a marijuana charge can still cause problems, even if it is not a crime.\n\nSome people say it costs too much money to arrest and try people for marijuana.  It costs money to take them to court and pay for lawyers.  So, some cities do not want to make marijuana a smaller problem.  They do not want to spend the money.\n\nBut some cities are okay with making marijuana a smaller problem.  Denver is one example.  People in Denver tend to be more open-minded.  This city now has more money to spend on important things like schools, food for the homeless, and help for the elderly.\n\nIt is a good idea to make marijuana a smaller problem.  But it is also true that marijuana can be a problem.  If people can buy it anywhere, they might smoke it while driving.  Smoking marijuana is not accepted in many places.  Some people do not want to see it everywhere.\n\nAlcohol can also cause problems.  It can affect how people drive and make decisions.  Marijuana can affect how people live their lives.  People react to substances differently.  Some people can use them without problems, but others cannot.\n\nSo, it is hard to say what to do about marijuana.  But it is true that both marijuana and alcohol can cause problems.  We need to be careful and think about how to use them.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nTraditional things are very important. \nThey have been done this way for a long time. \nIt is good to be connected to the past. \nBut it is also important to be able to change. \nI think this is true. \n\nMany Catholics go to church every week. \nThey do things a certain way. \nI feel that the Catholic Church does not accept people who do not follow its rules very well. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \nThis happened to my parents. \nMy mom was a Catholic and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThey could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \n\nThe Catholic Church teaches us to love others. \nBut it does not practice what it preaches. \nThis is because some of its old rules are not good. \nThe Church keeps these rules anyway. \n\nI do not think that allowing priests to marry would make a difference. \nSome people who do bad things will do them anyway. \nThey will hurt children, no matter if they are married or not. \nThis is a big problem. \n\nWe should focus on stopping people from hurting children. \nAllowing priests to marry will not solve this problem. \nWe need to find other ways to stop this from happening.",
            "I'm not sure about this issue yet.  \nI don't know if one side is right or wrong.  \nThis is a very difficult problem we face now.  \nIt's hard to decide when the line between church and state is unclear.  \nAlso, defining marriage is a very hard job because it can offend people.  \n\nI don't know if marriage should be decided by the government.  \nSome people think it's a special ceremony, like a sacrament.  \nIf that's true, then people in a marriage could get tax breaks.  \nOr they could get special treatment from the government because they were baptized.  \nBut I think the government should just look at marriage as a civil union.  \nIt's a union between two people, and that's all.  \n\nThey shouldn't ask what kind of marriage it is or what church the couple belongs to.  \nIt's just two people who are together.  \nThe issue of gay marriage is similar.  \nIt's just two people who are in a union.  \n\nIf all the states can agree on this, then they should make it a federal law.  \nBut making a constitutional amendment to stop gay marriage is not right.  \nThe constitution should not be changed just because many people don't like it.  \nIt's not important enough to change the constitution over.  \nWe just need to accept that marriage is between two people who love each other.  \n\nNo, I don't think the constitution should be changed for this reason.",
            "I grew up in a Christian family. For me, homosexuality is a complicated issue. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with all parts of the gay lifestyle. But I think it should be legal. I do not think it is a national problem. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are Republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how the state feels about this issue. I do not think you can disagree with a state's decision if it decides to allow gay marriage. You chose to live there.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. So, each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already said this. I do not think the president should decide what is best for every state. George Bush does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state runs itself.\n\nSome things should be decided by each state. George Bush will not be president for much longer. If a new president wants to allow gay marriage, the law might change. But that is not necessary. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nNo, I do not agree with that. I think each state should make its own decision about gay marriage.",
            "I think school officials have the right to see what students are posting on the internet. Myspace is a public place where people share things for everyone to see. If you post something on the internet, you have to be ready for anyone to see it, including school officials.\n\nEven if you don't put the school's name on it, they can still find it if they want to. They can use their computers at home to look for it. The school officials' job is to keep students safe. If they find something that can help them do this, I think it's okay for them to look at it.\n\nFor example, if they go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking, I think that's okay. It's their job to keep the school safe and make sure students are not breaking the rules.\n\nBut if they just go on the internet to catch students and get them in trouble, I think that's not right. It's an invasion of privacy. However, if they find something that helps them keep the school safe, I think it's okay.\n\nSome people might think it's not right for school officials to look at what students are posting on the internet. But I think it's okay as long as it helps keep the school safe. We had lock-down drills in my school to prepare for emergencies. It's like the school officials are doing the same thing, trying to keep the school safe.\n\nThey are not trying to catch students; they are trying to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting. We had a shooting at Columbine High School, and it was very sad. So, I think school officials are doing the right thing by looking at what students are posting on the internet.\n\nWe have to be careful about what we post on the internet because it can come back and hurt us. It's like a big record of everything we do. If we say or do something bad when we're a student, it can come back and cause problems when we're older. It's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nSo, I think school officials are okay to look at what students are posting on the internet if it helps them keep the school safe. But they should not just look for ways to catch students. They should look for ways to help the school and keep everyone safe.",
            "I want to talk about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea. I was personally affected by 9/11. I wanted to go to that country and make them feel what we felt after 9/11.\n\nHowever, I think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term effects of our actions. We went to war without a plan. This was a big mistake.\n\nI was for the war at first, but now I am against it. I don't think it helped. The people in that country are fighting with each other. They can't fight with us if they can't even get along with themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 changed my feelings about that country. I don't care what happens there anymore. I think they are not very nice people when it comes to war. They just want to fight. They don't want to make their country better.\n\nI think we went to war for revenge, not a good reason. We were angry and wanted to fight back. We didn't think about what could happen. President Bush decided to go to war with Iraq. I understand why he did it, but I think we should have had a better plan.\n\nWe didn't have unity and clarity about what we wanted to do in that country. We didn't think about how to create order. I think this would have helped us a lot.\n\nI don't think we can change those people. They will always be the same. We are not helping them by staying there. We are just hurting ourselves. We can't stay in that country forever. When we leave, it will collapse. I think we should leave now."
