            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. It has grown dim. Its words, once thunder, now a whisper in the wind.  They speak of dwindling numbers, of souls turning away. Perhaps it's the granite heart, unyielding to the changing tides.  The unyielding stance on the matter of unions between two men. On the taking of a life before its time. On the shaping of a woman's own flesh. These are things that bring men to their knees, things the Church sees as sin. But the world moves on, the sun rises and sets, and the old ways, well, they don't always hold.\n\nThere are those who see this, who feel the Church's grip loosening. They speak of a need for change, for a softening of the lines, a willingness to meet the world halfway. The Church clings to its pronouncements, to its ancient pronouncements, but the world whispers back, a chorus of dissent.\n\nAnd what of the priest? Bound to his vows, to God alone. They say he is a man given over to a higher calling. But is it not a lonely calling? A life of service without the warmth of family, the love of a partner? Can a man truly be whole, devoted to God alone?  The world holds no answers, only questions that echo in the silence.",

But what of them drawn to their own kind? Born that way, ain't no choice in it. Like the color of your eyes, the shape of your hand. Can't help but be what you are.  \n\nTo say they shouldn't be joined, that's wrong. It's like saying the sun shouldn't rise, or the wind shouldn't blow. They're just livin' their lives. \n\nThe government, they got no business in this. This ain't about laws or borders or the defense of the land. This is about hearts.  Let them love, let them be.  That's all.",

They fear the different, the one who walks a path not their own. But love is love. It takes root in the same earth, blooms under the same sun. Two souls bound, two hearts beating as one, what difference does it make if the flesh is the same or different? \n\nThey say it weakens the family.  But the family, what is it? A cage of expectations, a rigid box to hold the heart?  Love knows no bounds, no lines drawn in sand.  It thrives in the spaces between, in the whispers of understanding, in the touch that speaks a thousand words. \n\nThey speak of children, of innocence corrupted. But innocence is not a fragile thing, a thing to be protected from the world. It is a seed, strong and resilient, that grows in the light of acceptance, not fear.  \n\nThey cling to dogma, to the pronouncements of men who claim to know the divine. But God, if He exists, does He not see the love in these souls? Does He not hear the beating of their hearts?  Does He not understand the longing for connection, for belonging?\n\nThe government, they say, should not interfere. But the government, is it not a reflection of the people? Is it not our responsibility to ensure that the law reflects the truth, the undeniable truth that love is love, that all are created equal?\n\nThere is no room for hate in a world that needs more love. Let us tear down the walls, the walls of prejudice and fear. Let us build a world where all can love freely, openly, and without shame.",

People come in their beach clothes, sand still clinging to their shoulders, families running in late, a blur of Sunday errands. Even the morning masses, the ones I used to dress for, jeans and khakis now. Khakis, they have their place, but it's not the same. More casual, that's what I see. \n\nI don't know the church's heart, the politics and whispers that move in the shadows. But this, this I see.

Least of all a war fought on a whim, a preemptive strike. This war, it echoed the ghosts of Vietnam, the same mistakes, the same blood on the ground. American boys dying for a land that wasn't theirs, for a cause that wasn't clear. They went in, ripped the government from its roots, and left a hollow space, a void waiting to be filled with chaos. They thought they could plant democracy, like a seed in parched soil, and watch it bloom. They forgot the earth remembers, and the seeds of unrest take root in the darkness.\n\nLike Vietnam, it wasn't a clean fight. You can't fight a nation with flags and uniforms, when the enemy wears the face of the people. You can't bomb away their anger, their desperation. \n\nThey said it would be a swift victory. A cakewalk. But wars ain't cakewalks. They're a slow burn, a festering wound that refuses to heal. They left the people to their own devices, to the ghosts of their past and the bitterness of the present. They left them with a promise of freedom, but freedom comes with a price. A price they weren't willing to pay.\n\nAnd now, we're still there, years later. The land scarred, the people broken, the dream of a peaceful future a distant echo. The war in Iraq, it's a cautionary tale, a reminder that some wounds can't be healed, some mistakes can't be undone. And the echoes of those mistakes will linger long after the guns fall silent.",

A victory lap in a race with no finish line.\n\nIt's time to let them stand on their own.  Time to turn our eyes inward. To mend our own wounds.  Billions bled dry in a desert far from home.  Billions that could feed the hungry.  Heal the sick.  Build a bridge over the chasm of poverty.\n\nWe have our own battles to fight. This war, this endless, pointless war, it's a wound that festers.  It's time to close it.",
            "The question hung in the air, a thin wisp of smoke.  Someone had seen it, that's what he said. Found it online.  A profile, a window into a life.  And stopped it. Prevented something dark.  Was that an invasion, though?  On Myspace, the air was thick with the scent of exposure.  You put it out there, you shared it, like a prayer carried on the wind.  Anyone could see it, anyone could hear.  What you shared, what you kept close, it didn't matter much.  It was out there, a ghost in the machine.\n\nBut to have someone watching, someone searching... that felt different.  To sift through the digital dust, looking for signs, for danger.  Was that right?  To single out the troubled, the troubled ones who might slip through the cracks.  The good ones, the ones who wanted to do no harm, they wouldn't need watching, would they?  But you couldn't watch them all, not every profile, not every whispered secret.  It wouldn't be right.  \n\nStill, the world was a strange and shadowed place, even in the bright glow of the screen.  He'd seen it himself, the man who could weave through the digital canyons, finding names, finding faces, finding vulnerabilities.  A girl, a screen name, a chat window, and a meeting arranged in the blink of an eye.  It was a cold, hard truth, that the things you shared, the things you thought were private, could be snatched away like a gust of wind.\n\nAnd the schools, they tried to control it, to keep the shadows at bay.  But how could they? How could they stop the whispers, the digital rustling of secrets?  The truth was out there, waiting to be found.",
            "The desert wind whispers of folly.  And this war, this endless sandstorm of a war, is a testament to it. To speak of it now, it feels like joining a chorus of the damned, those who saw the folly from the start. But the truth is a bone in the throat, hard to swallow. The sky was full of hawks, they said, and the vultures circled.  The polls told a story, a bleak one, of dissent. The world agreed, even the ghosts of the fallen.  But the high towers in Washington, they clung to their own truths. A stubborn silence amidst the desert’s howl.\n\nThey spoke of democracy, a fragile bird attempting to nest in a wasteland. A culture clash, a chasm too wide to bridge.  Saddam, a serpent, yes, but the desert knew better.  It knew the price of such intrusions. They called it liberation, but the desert whispered of another word: quicksand. A slow, sucking pull leading only to ruin.\n\nWhat is left to say? The desert waits, patient and hungry.  The echoes of their boots still ring in its canyons, a constant reminder of a promise broken.  To stay, to leave, both paths lead to the same dust-filled horizon. A quicksand of their own making, a wasteland of their own design.",
            "The air hung thick with the stink of it. Discrimination.  Like a shroud over the land.  Not just for women, though they wear it heaviest. It clings to the work you do. Women face a glass ceiling, a shimmer in the air that hides the light of advancement.  Even with equality spoken of, men find it hard to bend knee to a woman's command.  Old ways die hard. A woman in the room might have the skills, the knowledge, the hunger, but the boardroom, set in the stone of tradition, might not see her fit for the top.\n\nMen too, though. Fathers staying home, tending children, they are looked upon askance. The world demands the man be out there, the moneymaker. The provider.  But what of the dreams that whisper in his heart? What of the love that binds him to his home?  Society judges, its eyes cold and unforgiving.\n\nEven in the world of fashion, a man's path is shadowed.  If he's straight, they question his worth.  The world sees a man in that world and thinks of a woman's touch. They doubt his knowledge, his vision.\n\nIt's a slow burn, this change.  The tide is turning, but it's a slow, stubborn thing. Women rise, men stay home, the world whispers doubts.  But the seeds are sown.   It takes time for roots to take hold, for the soil to shift.",
            "They didn't make it legal, no. Decriminalized it, they did. Dropped it down from a crime, a full-blown offense, to a ticket. Like running a red. You get cited, not booked, not hauled in. But the shadow of it, the stain, lingers. Job interviews, all that. The fear. That's what sticks.  Even decriminalized.  \n\nFor the city, it's a different game.  Arrest, booking, court. It eats up money. Appointing lawyers, judges, the whole apparatus. Costs a king's ransom. And for what? For a joint? Plenty of towns, they can't afford the luxury of compassion. They'd rather lock you up. \n\nBut Denver, different breed. A certain… openness. They see the cost, the waste. The money that could be spent elsewhere. Education, the old folks, feeding the hungry. It's a trade-off, ain't it?\n\nBut let's be clear. This ain't about making it free for all. Not like cigarettes, hanging from every gas station pump.  That's a different beast altogether. It's still a taboo thing, you see? Smoke it out in the open, it'd be... awkward.  Like a bad dream.\n\nAlcohol, now. That's a different kind of danger.  But weed, it gets under your skin. It changes things. Makes you different. And everyone reacts different. Some can handle it, some can't. \n\nIt's a hard line to draw, ain't it?",
            "The Church. It calls itself the one true way.  Tradition, they say. Time-worn ways. Rooted deep. But the earth shifts. The seasons turn. And the old ways, well, they can become brittle. Like a dried husk.  \n\nThey say you must kneel. Every Sunday. Their rules, their rituals. A strict book. A hard line drawn. And who falls outside? They judge. They cast out. The imperfect, the different. The ones who pray to a different God. \n\nMy father, he walked a different path. An Episcopalian. My mother, Catholic.  The Church said no. They wouldn't bless their union. Tolerance? A whispered word.\n\nThey preach love. But their love is narrow. A love confined by stone walls and dogma. A love that turns its back on the stray sheep.  \n\nThe priests. They hold power. They speak in God's name. Yet some, they walk a dark path. The shadows cling. And the Church, it turns a blind eye.\n\nThey say marriage would change them. Make them better. But the darkness, it doesn't need a ring. It finds its own way. A child, vulnerable. A soul craving light. \n\nThe Church clings to its ways. Even when the light fades.",
            "The matter weighs on me.  A question of angles.  Church and state. Two things tangled tight. A knot you can't untie without hurting somebody. Defining marriage.  A sacrament, they say. But is it the government's business? They don't concern themselves with baptism, do they? No tax breaks, no special look. Just a union. Two souls tethered. And if it's a union, why the fuss?  Civil union.  That's what it is.  \n\nLet them come to their own reckonings, let the states find some common ground. Then maybe, just maybe, it could rise to something more. But a ban?  In the constitution?  That's a heavy hammer for a featherweight fight.  The constitution ain't meant for every whim. Some things are bigger. This ain't one of them.\n\nNo.",
            "Raised in the fold,  the word was scripture.  But these friends I've got, they walk a different path. A lightness in their steps, a kinship in their eyes. It's not a thing I understand, not wholly.  But the law's a cold blade, should cut both ways.  Let the states decide. They know their soil, their people. Let them bear the weight of their own choices. A president, he's but a shadow, a man in a suit, passing through.  He don't live in every corner of this land, don't breath the same air, don't feel the same sun.  It's their lives, their burdens. Let them choose.",
            "The thing about Myspace. It's public, ain't it? A bulletin board. A place to post for all to see. If you put it out there, you gotta reckon with what happens next. Folks seein' it, school folk included. No matter what they're callin' themselves, they can find it. Even from their own homes.\n\nNow, school officials, they got a duty. Protect the kids. If that means lookin' at a kid's Myspace, well, maybe it's a means to an end. A way to keep the darkness at bay. Like them lockdowns, the drills they run after those reckonings in Colorado. It's about keepin' the bad things out, from slippin' in.\n\nBut yeah, there's a line. A school snoopin' just to catch kids drinkin', smokin', doin' things they ain't supposed to, that's a different story. That's a violation, plain and simple.\n\nStill, if it stops a tragedy, if it keeps the blood from spillin', maybe that's a price worth payin'. Hard to say.  But you gotta understand, once somethin's out there, it's out there. Like a whisper in the wind, it follows you.",
            "The war. It came on quick. Nine Eleven. It cut deep. Made you want to see blood. To make them feel the same. A rage. Blind. They'd done the hurting, now it was our turn. Didn't think much past that. What comes after, who knows.  \n\nWent in unprepared. Like a dog at a fight, teeth bared, no plan. It backfired.  Big time.\n\nThey're fighting amongst themselves. That's what they do. Us over there, it don't mean a damn thing. They tear each other up, no reason, no rhyme.  \n\nSometimes, I don't know if they're even human. Just animals.  \n\nDidn't know what we'd find. They fight different over there. Savage. Not for country, not for cause. Just to get us out. They want us gone. Maybe that's the only thing they understand.\n\nWe were hyped up. Fueled by anger. Didn't think. Didn't see the future. Just the moment. \n\nBush, he gave in to it too. The people wanted it, so he gave it to them. A war. A revenge.\n\nBut maybe he was right. Couldn't just let it go. Had to do something.  \n\nBut we could have done better. Had a plan. A purpose. Instead, it was just a flood of anger. We made it worse.  \n\nWe can't change them. They'll always be what they are.  \n\nWe're hurting ourselves staying there. It's a wound that won't heal. We need to leave."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. It has grown dim. Its words, once thunder, now a whisper in the wind.  They speak of dwindling numbers, of souls turning away. Perhaps it's the granite heart, unyielding to the changing tides.  The unyielding stance on the matter of unions between two men. On the taking of a life before its time. On the shaping of a woman's own flesh. These are things that bring men to their knees, things the Church sees as sin. But the world moves on, the sun rises and sets, and the old ways, well, they don't always hold.\n\nThere are those who see this, who feel the Church's grip loosening. They speak of a need for change, for a softening of the lines, a willingness to meet the world halfway. The Church clings to its pronouncements, to its ancient pronouncements, but the world whispers back, a chorus of dissent.\n\nAnd what of the priest? Bound to his vows, to God alone. They say he is a man given over to a higher calling. But is it not a lonely calling? A life of service without the warmth of family, the love of a partner? Can a man truly be whole, devoted to God alone?  The world holds no answers, only questions that echo in the silence.",

But what of them drawn to their own kind? Born that way, ain't no choice in it. Like the color of your eyes, the shape of your hand. Can't help but be what you are.  \n\nTo say they shouldn't be joined, that's wrong. It's like saying the sun shouldn't rise, or the wind shouldn't blow. They're just livin' their lives. \n\nThe government, they got no business in this. This ain't about laws or borders or the defense of the land. This is about hearts.  Let them love, let them be.  That's all.",
            "The right to wed. A simple thing, a paper. But it seems the world can't grasp its own reflection. They see a shadow, a darkness, a threat to the order they know. They fear the different, the one who walks a path not their own. But love is love. It takes root in the same earth, blooms under the same sun. Two souls bound, two hearts beating as one, what difference does it make if the flesh is the same or different? \n\nThey say it weakens the family.  But the family, what is it? A cage of expectations, a rigid box to hold the heart?  Love knows no bounds, no lines drawn in sand.  It thrives in the spaces between, in the whispers of understanding, in the touch that speaks a thousand words. \n\nThey speak of children, of innocence corrupted. But innocence is not a fragile thing, a thing to be protected from the world. It is a seed, strong and resilient, that grows in the light of acceptance, not fear.  \n\nThey cling to dogma, to the pronouncements of men who claim to know the divine. But God, if He exists, does He not see the love in these souls? Does He not hear the beating of their hearts?  Does He not understand the longing for connection, for belonging?\n\nThe government, they say, should not interfere. But the government, is it not a reflection of the people? Is it not our responsibility to ensure that the law reflects the truth, the undeniable truth that love is love, that all are created equal?\n\nThere is no room for hate in a world that needs more love. Let us tear down the walls, the walls of prejudice and fear. Let us build a world where all can love freely, openly, and without shame.",

We'd all be there, the school girls, a procession of hushed whispers and starched collars. \n\nNow, there's a mass for the young ones, a quick thing, thirty minutes sharp.  People come in their beach clothes, sand still clinging to their shoulders, families running in late, a blur of Sunday errands. Even the morning masses, the ones I used to dress for, jeans and khakis now. Khakis, they have their place, but it's not the same. More casual, that's what I see. \n\nI don't know the church's heart, the politics and whispers that move in the shadows. But this, this I see. The clothes, the faces. \n\nAs for the stories, the ones whispered in hushed tones, about the men of the cloth and the darkness they carried...I don't think we can fix broken things with a different kind of collar. There are men who marry, who still carry the weight of that darkness. It's not the vows, it's the man himself. \n\nSome say the church should change, allow women to preach, allow men to marry. But what if it's a sickness in the soul, something that can't be cured by rules and rituals?  Maybe the answer isn't in the church at all, maybe it's in the hearts of the men who wear its robes.",

And they went in.  Pretexts. The air was thick with them. The Bush men, they spun a yarn about Bin Laden, about Saddam, about weapons that never were.  It chafed, it gnawed. The blood ran cold. The lies, plain as day, whispered from the mouths of men in suits.  \n\nPowell, he went to the world stage, a choirboy with a bomb in his hand. Now he speaks of doubt, of a foundation built on sand. Malfeasance. A stain on the soul of a nation.  \n\nThe Constitution, a tattered flag in a hurricane.  They came in with a hunger for war, a thirst for something darker. The treasury man, gone now, whispered of it in his book. A blood debt, an inheritance passed down.  They spoke of energy, of a thirst that could only be quenched in oil fields. \n\nIt went on too long, this war. A serpent's nest, festering. If they pulled back now, the wounds would bleed anew. The UN and their allies,  a patchwork quilt of nations, they talked of order, of peace.  But who holds the hand on the tiller when the ship is adrift? Iraq, a land carved up, its soul bleeding. The parliament, a hollow shell. The Prime Minister, a puppet dancing on strings. Sadr, the firebrand, his shadow stretching across the halls of power. \n\nThe laughter died on his lips. A bitter taste, a truth too raw to speak.",

A reckoning, a score to settle.  A ghost of vengeance.\"\n\nHe paused, the silence heavy as a shroud.  \"They say it's for democracy, for oil.  For the good of the people.

They talk of making it illegal, these men, these politicians. But what right have they? One church's creed over another's?  Look at the Catholics, the Christians. Most turn from it, reject it. Except maybe up north, in those cities with their own kind of darkness. But this, this is not for the government.  \n\nThis is a matter for the faithful. Let them decide. \n\nThe Constitution, it was meant to allow for tolerance.  And any amendment, any attempt to bind them, to restrict, it would be a perversion.  A turning against its own purpose.

And in that, he betrays the very principle he claims to uphold. What he wants is for one voice to drown out the others. \n\nLet the churches decide. Let them be the arbiters.

But the day the towers fell, it wasn't the day the road to Baghdad was paved. They played on fear, on the raw grief of a nation. \n\nI ain't no man for war. Least of all a war fought on a whim, a preemptive strike. This war, it echoed the ghosts of Vietnam, the same mistakes, the same blood on the ground. American boys dying for a land that wasn't theirs, for a cause that wasn't clear. They went in, ripped the government from its roots, and left a hollow space, a void waiting to be filled with chaos. They thought they could plant democracy, like a seed in parched soil, and watch it bloom. They forgot the earth remembers, and the seeds of unrest take root in the darkness.\n\nLike Vietnam, it wasn't a clean fight. You can't fight a nation with flags and uniforms, when the enemy wears the face of the people. You can't bomb away their anger, their desperation. \n\nThey said it would be a swift victory. A cakewalk. But wars ain't cakewalks. They're a slow burn, a festering wound that refuses to heal. They left the people to their own devices, to the ghosts of their past and the bitterness of the present. They left them with a promise of freedom, but freedom comes with a price. A price they weren't willing to pay.\n\nAnd now, we're still there, years later. The land scarred, the people broken, the dream of a peaceful future a distant echo. The war in Iraq, it's a cautionary tale, a reminder that some wounds can't be healed, some mistakes can't be undone. And the echoes of those mistakes will linger long after the guns fall silent.",

It ain't right, denyin' a soul its right to love.\" \n\nHe spat a stream of tobacco juice into the dusty street. \"Politics, government, they got no business in this.

Prevented something dark.  Was that an invasion, though?  On Myspace, the air was thick with the scent of exposure.  You put it out there, you shared it, like a prayer carried on the wind.

To speak of it now, it feels like joining a chorus of the damned, those who saw the folly from the start. But the truth is a bone in the throat, hard to swallow. The sky was full of hawks, they said, and the vultures circled.  The polls told a story, a bleak one, of dissent. The world agreed, even the ghosts of the fallen.  But the high towers in Washington, they clung to their own truths. A stubborn silence amidst the desert’s howl.\n\nThey spoke of democracy, a fragile bird attempting to nest in a wasteland. A culture clash, a chasm too wide to bridge.  Saddam, a serpent, yes, but the desert knew better.  It knew the price of such intrusions. They called it liberation, but the desert whispered of another word: quicksand. A slow, sucking pull leading only to ruin.\n\nWhat is left to say? The desert waits, patient and hungry.  The echoes of their boots still ring in its canyons, a constant reminder of a promise broken.  To stay, to leave, both paths lead to the same dust-filled horizon. A quicksand of their own making, a wasteland of their own design.",
            "The air hung thick with the stink of it. Discrimination.  Like a shroud over the land.  Not just for women, though they wear it heaviest. It clings to the work you do. Women face a glass ceiling, a shimmer in the air that hides the light of advancement.  Even with equality spoken of, men find it hard to bend knee to a woman's command.  Old ways die hard. A woman in the room might have the skills, the knowledge, the hunger, but the boardroom, set in the stone of tradition, might not see her fit for the top.\n\nMen too, though. Fathers staying home, tending children, they are looked upon askance. The world demands the man be out there, the moneymaker. The provider.  But what of the dreams that whisper in his heart? What of the love that binds him to his home?  Society judges, its eyes cold and unforgiving.\n\nEven in the world of fashion, a man's path is shadowed.  If he's straight, they question his worth.  The world sees a man in that world and thinks of a woman's touch. They doubt his knowledge, his vision.\n\nIt's a slow burn, this change.  The tide is turning, but it's a slow, stubborn thing. Women rise, men stay home, the world whispers doubts.  But the seeds are sown.   It takes time for roots to take hold, for the soil to shift.",
            "They didn't make it legal, no. Decriminalized it, they did. Dropped it down from a crime, a full-blown offense, to a ticket. Like running a red. You get cited, not booked, not hauled in. But the shadow of it, the stain, lingers. Job interviews, all that. The fear. That's what sticks.  Even decriminalized.  \n\nFor the city, it's a different game.  Arrest, booking, court. It eats up money. Appointing lawyers, judges, the whole apparatus. Costs a king's ransom. And for what? For a joint? Plenty of towns, they can't afford the luxury of compassion. They'd rather lock you up. \n\nBut Denver, different breed. A certain… openness. They see the cost, the waste. The money that could be spent elsewhere. Education, the old folks, feeding the hungry. It's a trade-off, ain't it?\n\nBut let's be clear. This ain't about making it free for all. Not like cigarettes, hanging from every gas station pump.  That's a different beast altogether. It's still a taboo thing, you see? Smoke it out in the open, it'd be... awkward.  Like a bad dream.\n\nAlcohol, now. That's a different kind of danger.  But weed, it gets under your skin. It changes things. Makes you different. And everyone reacts different. Some can handle it, some can't. \n\nIt's a hard line to draw, ain't it?",
            "The Church. It calls itself the one true way.  Tradition, they say. Time-worn ways. Rooted deep. But the earth shifts. The seasons turn. And the old ways, well, they can become brittle. Like a dried husk.  \n\nThey say you must kneel. Every Sunday. Their rules, their rituals. A strict book. A hard line drawn. And who falls outside? They judge. They cast out. The imperfect, the different. The ones who pray to a different God. \n\nMy father, he walked a different path. An Episcopalian. My mother, Catholic.  The Church said no. They wouldn't bless their union. Tolerance? A whispered word.\n\nThey preach love. But their love is narrow. A love confined by stone walls and dogma. A love that turns its back on the stray sheep.  \n\nThe priests. They hold power. They speak in God's name. Yet some, they walk a dark path. The shadows cling. And the Church, it turns a blind eye.\n\nThey say marriage would change them. Make them better. But the darkness, it doesn't need a ring. It finds its own way. A child, vulnerable. A soul craving light. \n\nThe Church clings to its ways. Even when the light fades.",
            "The matter weighs on me.  A question of angles.  Church and state. Two things tangled tight. A knot you can't untie without hurting somebody. Defining marriage.  A sacrament, they say. But is it the government's business? They don't concern themselves with baptism, do they? No tax breaks, no special look. Just a union. Two souls tethered. And if it's a union, why the fuss?  Civil union.  That's what it is.  \n\nLet them come to their own reckonings, let the states find some common ground. Then maybe, just maybe, it could rise to something more. But a ban?  In the constitution?  That's a heavy hammer for a featherweight fight.  The constitution ain't meant for every whim. Some things are bigger. This ain't one of them.\n\nNo.",
            "Raised in the fold,  the word was scripture.  But these friends I've got, they walk a different path. A lightness in their steps, a kinship in their eyes. It's not a thing I understand, not wholly.  But the law's a cold blade, should cut both ways.  Let the states decide. They know their soil, their people. Let them bear the weight of their own choices. A president, he's but a shadow, a man in a suit, passing through.  He don't live in every corner of this land, don't breath the same air, don't feel the same sun.  It's their lives, their burdens. Let them choose.",
            "The thing about Myspace. It's public, ain't it? A bulletin board. A place to post for all to see. If you put it out there, you gotta reckon with what happens next. Folks seein' it, school folk included. No matter what they're callin' themselves, they can find it. Even from their own homes.\n\nNow, school officials, they got a duty. Protect the kids. If that means lookin' at a kid's Myspace, well, maybe it's a means to an end. A way to keep the darkness at bay. Like them lockdowns, the drills they run after those reckonings in Colorado. It's about keepin' the bad things out, from slippin' in.\n\nBut yeah, there's a line. A school snoopin' just to catch kids drinkin', smokin', doin' things they ain't supposed to, that's a different story. That's a violation, plain and simple.\n\nStill, if it stops a tragedy, if it keeps the blood from spillin', maybe that's a price worth payin'. Hard to say.  But you gotta understand, once somethin's out there, it's out there. Like a whisper in the wind, it follows you.",
            "The war. It came on quick. Nine Eleven. It cut deep. Made you want to see blood. To make them feel the same. A rage. Blind. They'd done the hurting, now it was our turn. Didn't think much past that. What comes after, who knows.  \n\nWent in unprepared. Like a dog at a fight, teeth bared, no plan. It backfired.  Big time.\n\nThey're fighting amongst themselves. That's what they do. Us over there, it don't mean a damn thing. They tear each other up, no reason, no rhyme.  \n\nSometimes, I don't know if they're even human. Just animals.  \n\nDidn't know what we'd find. They fight different over there. Savage. Not for country, not for cause. Just to get us out. They want us gone. Maybe that's the only thing they understand.\n\nWe were hyped up. Fueled by anger. Didn't think. Didn't see the future. Just the moment. \n\nBush, he gave in to it too. The people wanted it, so he gave it to them. A war. A revenge.\n\nBut maybe he was right. Couldn't just let it go. Had to do something.  \n\nBut we could have done better. Had a plan. A purpose. Instead, it was just a flood of anger. We made it worse.  \n\nWe can't change them. They'll always be what they are.  \n\nWe're hurting ourselves staying there. It's a wound that won't heal. We need to leave."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. It has grown dim. Its words, once thunder, now a whisper in the wind.  They speak of dwindling numbers, of souls turning away. Perhaps it's the granite heart, unyielding to the changing tides.  The unyielding stance on the matter of unions between two men. On the taking of a life before its time. On the shaping of a woman's own flesh. These are things that bring men to their knees, things the Church sees as sin. But the world moves on, the sun rises and sets, and the old ways, well, they don't always hold.\n\nThere are those who see this, who feel the Church's grip loosening. They speak of a need for change, for a softening of the lines, a willingness to meet the world halfway. The Church clings to its pronouncements, to its ancient pronouncements, but the world whispers back, a chorus of dissent.\n\nAnd what of the priest? Bound to his vows, to God alone. They say he is a man given over to a higher calling. But is it not a lonely calling? A life of service without the warmth of family, the love of a partner? Can a man truly be whole, devoted to God alone?  The world holds no answers, only questions that echo in the silence.",

But what of them drawn to their own kind? Born that way, ain't no choice in it. Like the color of your eyes, the shape of your hand. Can't help but be what you are.  \n\nTo say they shouldn't be joined, that's wrong. It's like saying the sun shouldn't rise, or the wind shouldn't blow. They're just livin' their lives. \n\nThe government, they got no business in this. This ain't about laws or borders or the defense of the land. This is about hearts.  Let them love, let them be.  That's all.",
            "The right to wed. A simple thing, a paper. But it seems the world can't grasp its own reflection. They see a shadow, a darkness, a threat to the order they know. They fear the different, the one who walks a path not their own. But love is love. It takes root in the same earth, blooms under the same sun. Two souls bound, two hearts beating as one, what difference does it make if the flesh is the same or different? \n\nThey say it weakens the family.  But the family, what is it? A cage of expectations, a rigid box to hold the heart?  Love knows no bounds, no lines drawn in sand.  It thrives in the spaces between, in the whispers of understanding, in the touch that speaks a thousand words. \n\nThey speak of children, of innocence corrupted. But innocence is not a fragile thing, a thing to be protected from the world. It is a seed, strong and resilient, that grows in the light of acceptance, not fear.  \n\nThey cling to dogma, to the pronouncements of men who claim to know the divine. But God, if He exists, does He not see the love in these souls? Does He not hear the beating of their hearts?  Does He not understand the longing for connection, for belonging?\n\nThe government, they say, should not interfere. But the government, is it not a reflection of the people? Is it not our responsibility to ensure that the law reflects the truth, the undeniable truth that love is love, that all are created equal?\n\nThere is no room for hate in a world that needs more love. Let us tear down the walls, the walls of prejudice and fear. Let us build a world where all can love freely, openly, and without shame.",

We'd all be there, the school girls, a procession of hushed whispers and starched collars. \n\nNow, there's a mass for the young ones, a quick thing, thirty minutes sharp.  People come in their beach clothes, sand still clinging to their shoulders, families running in late, a blur of Sunday errands. Even the morning masses, the ones I used to dress for, jeans and khakis now. Khakis, they have their place, but it's not the same. More casual, that's what I see. \n\nI don't know the church's heart, the politics and whispers that move in the shadows. But this, this I see. The clothes, the faces. \n\nAs for the stories, the ones whispered in hushed tones, about the men of the cloth and the darkness they carried...I don't think we can fix broken things with a different kind of collar. There are men who marry, who still carry the weight of that darkness. It's not the vows, it's the man himself. \n\nSome say the church should change, allow women to preach, allow men to marry. But what if it's a sickness in the soul, something that can't be cured by rules and rituals?  Maybe the answer isn't in the church at all, maybe it's in the hearts of the men who wear its robes.",

And they went in.  Pretexts. The air was thick with them. The Bush men, they spun a yarn about Bin Laden, about Saddam, about weapons that never were.  It chafed, it gnawed. The blood ran cold. The lies, plain as day, whispered from the mouths of men in suits.  \n\nPowell, he went to the world stage, a choirboy with a bomb in his hand. Now he speaks of doubt, of a foundation built on sand. Malfeasance. A stain on the soul of a nation.  \n\nThe Constitution, a tattered flag in a hurricane.  They came in with a hunger for war, a thirst for something darker. The treasury man, gone now, whispered of it in his book. A blood debt, an inheritance passed down.  They spoke of energy, of a thirst that could only be quenched in oil fields. \n\nIt went on too long, this war. A serpent's nest, festering. If they pulled back now, the wounds would bleed anew. The UN and their allies,  a patchwork quilt of nations, they talked of order, of peace.  But who holds the hand on the tiller when the ship is adrift? Iraq, a land carved up, its soul bleeding. The parliament, a hollow shell. The Prime Minister, a puppet dancing on strings. Sadr, the firebrand, his shadow stretching across the halls of power. \n\nThe laughter died on his lips. A bitter taste, a truth too raw to speak.",

A reckoning, a score to settle.  A ghost of vengeance.\"\n\nHe paused, the silence heavy as a shroud.  \"They say it's for democracy, for oil.  For the good of the people.

They talk of making it illegal, these men, these politicians. But what right have they? One church's creed over another's?  Look at the Catholics, the Christians. Most turn from it, reject it. Except maybe up north, in those cities with their own kind of darkness. But this, this is not for the government.  \n\nThis is a matter for the faithful. Let them decide. \n\nThe Constitution, it was meant to allow for tolerance.  And any amendment, any attempt to bind them, to restrict, it would be a perversion.  A turning against its own purpose.

And in that, he betrays the very principle he claims to uphold. What he wants is for one voice to drown out the others. \n\nLet the churches decide. Let them be the arbiters.

But the day the towers fell, it wasn't the day the road to Baghdad was paved. They played on fear, on the raw grief of a nation. \n\nI ain't no man for war. Least of all a war fought on a whim, a preemptive strike. This war, it echoed the ghosts of Vietnam, the same mistakes, the same blood on the ground. American boys dying for a land that wasn't theirs, for a cause that wasn't clear. They went in, ripped the government from its roots, and left a hollow space, a void waiting to be filled with chaos. They thought they could plant democracy, like a seed in parched soil, and watch it bloom. They forgot the earth remembers, and the seeds of unrest take root in the darkness.\n\nLike Vietnam, it wasn't a clean fight. You can't fight a nation with flags and uniforms, when the enemy wears the face of the people. You can't bomb away their anger, their desperation. \n\nThey said it would be a swift victory. A cakewalk. But wars ain't cakewalks. They're a slow burn, a festering wound that refuses to heal. They left the people to their own devices, to the ghosts of their past and the bitterness of the present. They left them with a promise of freedom, but freedom comes with a price. A price they weren't willing to pay.\n\nAnd now, we're still there, years later. The land scarred, the people broken, the dream of a peaceful future a distant echo. The war in Iraq, it's a cautionary tale, a reminder that some wounds can't be healed, some mistakes can't be undone. And the echoes of those mistakes will linger long after the guns fall silent.",

It ain't right, denyin' a soul its right to love.\" \n\nHe spat a stream of tobacco juice into the dusty street. \"Politics, government, they got no business in this.

Prevented something dark.  Was that an invasion, though?  On Myspace, the air was thick with the scent of exposure.  You put it out there, you shared it, like a prayer carried on the wind.

To speak of it now, it feels like joining a chorus of the damned, those who saw the folly from the start. But the truth is a bone in the throat, hard to swallow. The sky was full of hawks, they said, and the vultures circled.  The polls told a story, a bleak one, of dissent. The world agreed, even the ghosts of the fallen.  But the high towers in Washington, they clung to their own truths. A stubborn silence amidst the desert’s howl.\n\nThey spoke of democracy, a fragile bird attempting to nest in a wasteland. A culture clash, a chasm too wide to bridge.  Saddam, a serpent, yes, but the desert knew better.  It knew the price of such intrusions. They called it liberation, but the desert whispered of another word: quicksand. A slow, sucking pull leading only to ruin.\n\nWhat is left to say? The desert waits, patient and hungry.  The echoes of their boots still ring in its canyons, a constant reminder of a promise broken.  To stay, to leave, both paths lead to the same dust-filled horizon. A quicksand of their own making, a wasteland of their own design.",
            "The air hung thick with the stink of it. Discrimination.  Like a shroud over the land.  Not just for women, though they wear it heaviest. It clings to the work you do. Women face a glass ceiling, a shimmer in the air that hides the light of advancement.  Even with equality spoken of, men find it hard to bend knee to a woman's command.  Old ways die hard. A woman in the room might have the skills, the knowledge, the hunger, but the boardroom, set in the stone of tradition, might not see her fit for the top.\n\nMen too, though. Fathers staying home, tending children, they are looked upon askance. The world demands the man be out there, the moneymaker. The provider.  But what of the dreams that whisper in his heart? What of the love that binds him to his home?  Society judges, its eyes cold and unforgiving.\n\nEven in the world of fashion, a man's path is shadowed.  If he's straight, they question his worth.  The world sees a man in that world and thinks of a woman's touch. They doubt his knowledge, his vision.\n\nIt's a slow burn, this change.  The tide is turning, but it's a slow, stubborn thing. Women rise, men stay home, the world whispers doubts.  But the seeds are sown.   It takes time for roots to take hold, for the soil to shift.",
            "They didn't make it legal, no. Decriminalized it, they did. Dropped it down from a crime, a full-blown offense, to a ticket. Like running a red. You get cited, not booked, not hauled in. But the shadow of it, the stain, lingers. Job interviews, all that. The fear. That's what sticks.  Even decriminalized.  \n\nFor the city, it's a different game.  Arrest, booking, court. It eats up money. Appointing lawyers, judges, the whole apparatus. Costs a king's ransom. And for what? For a joint? Plenty of towns, they can't afford the luxury of compassion. They'd rather lock you up. \n\nBut Denver, different breed. A certain… openness. They see the cost, the waste. The money that could be spent elsewhere. Education, the old folks, feeding the hungry. It's a trade-off, ain't it?\n\nBut let's be clear. This ain't about making it free for all. Not like cigarettes, hanging from every gas station pump.  That's a different beast altogether. It's still a taboo thing, you see? Smoke it out in the open, it'd be... awkward.  Like a bad dream.\n\nAlcohol, now. That's a different kind of danger.  But weed, it gets under your skin. It changes things. Makes you different. And everyone reacts different. Some can handle it, some can't. \n\nIt's a hard line to draw, ain't it?",
            "The Church. It calls itself the one true way.  Tradition, they say. Time-worn ways. Rooted deep. But the earth shifts. The seasons turn. And the old ways, well, they can become brittle. Like a dried husk.  \n\nThey say you must kneel. Every Sunday. Their rules, their rituals. A strict book. A hard line drawn. And who falls outside? They judge. They cast out. The imperfect, the different. The ones who pray to a different God. \n\nMy father, he walked a different path. An Episcopalian. My mother, Catholic.  The Church said no. They wouldn't bless their union. Tolerance? A whispered word.\n\nThey preach love. But their love is narrow. A love confined by stone walls and dogma. A love that turns its back on the stray sheep.  \n\nThe priests. They hold power. They speak in God's name. Yet some, they walk a dark path. The shadows cling. And the Church, it turns a blind eye.\n\nThey say marriage would change them. Make them better. But the darkness, it doesn't need a ring. It finds its own way. A child, vulnerable. A soul craving light. \n\nThe Church clings to its ways. Even when the light fades.",
            "The matter weighs on me.  A question of angles.  Church and state. Two things tangled tight. A knot you can't untie without hurting somebody. Defining marriage.  A sacrament, they say. But is it the government's business? They don't concern themselves with baptism, do they? No tax breaks, no special look. Just a union. Two souls tethered. And if it's a union, why the fuss?  Civil union.  That's what it is.  \n\nLet them come to their own reckonings, let the states find some common ground. Then maybe, just maybe, it could rise to something more. But a ban?  In the constitution?  That's a heavy hammer for a featherweight fight.  The constitution ain't meant for every whim. Some things are bigger. This ain't one of them.\n\nNo.",
            "Raised in the fold,  the word was scripture.  But these friends I've got, they walk a different path. A lightness in their steps, a kinship in their eyes. It's not a thing I understand, not wholly.  But the law's a cold blade, should cut both ways.  Let the states decide. They know their soil, their people. Let them bear the weight of their own choices. A president, he's but a shadow, a man in a suit, passing through.  He don't live in every corner of this land, don't breath the same air, don't feel the same sun.  It's their lives, their burdens. Let them choose.",
            "The thing about Myspace. It's public, ain't it? A bulletin board. A place to post for all to see. If you put it out there, you gotta reckon with what happens next. Folks seein' it, school folk included. No matter what they're callin' themselves, they can find it. Even from their own homes.\n\nNow, school officials, they got a duty. Protect the kids. If that means lookin' at a kid's Myspace, well, maybe it's a means to an end. A way to keep the darkness at bay. Like them lockdowns, the drills they run after those reckonings in Colorado. It's about keepin' the bad things out, from slippin' in.\n\nBut yeah, there's a line. A school snoopin' just to catch kids drinkin', smokin', doin' things they ain't supposed to, that's a different story. That's a violation, plain and simple.\n\nStill, if it stops a tragedy, if it keeps the blood from spillin', maybe that's a price worth payin'. Hard to say.  But you gotta understand, once somethin's out there, it's out there. Like a whisper in the wind, it follows you.",
            "The war. It came on quick. Nine Eleven. It cut deep. Made you want to see blood. To make them feel the same. A rage. Blind. They'd done the hurting, now it was our turn. Didn't think much past that. What comes after, who knows.  \n\nWent in unprepared. Like a dog at a fight, teeth bared, no plan. It backfired.  Big time.\n\nThey're fighting amongst themselves. That's what they do. Us over there, it don't mean a damn thing. They tear each other up, no reason, no rhyme.  \n\nSometimes, I don't know if they're even human. Just animals.  \n\nDidn't know what we'd find. They fight different over there. Savage. Not for country, not for cause. Just to get us out. They want us gone. Maybe that's the only thing they understand.\n\nWe were hyped up. Fueled by anger. Didn't think. Didn't see the future. Just the moment. \n\nBush, he gave in to it too. The people wanted it, so he gave it to them. A war. A revenge.\n\nBut maybe he was right. Couldn't just let it go. Had to do something.  \n\nBut we could have done better. Had a plan. A purpose. Instead, it was just a flood of anger. We made it worse.  \n\nWe can't change them. They'll always be what they are.  \n\nWe're hurting ourselves staying there. It's a wound that won't heal. We need to leave."
