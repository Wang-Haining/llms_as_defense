            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. It speaks of things long past, of sins and sacraments, of a time when the world held different truths. Yet the world has turned, the wind has shifted. And the whispers grow louder. They say the pews are emptying, the flock scattering. The old doctrines, once ironclad, now seem brittle, cracked by the weight of modern doubt.\n\nThey speak of marriage, of love between men and between women, of choice in the matter of life's beginning. These are things the Church holds fast against, a wall of dogma built against the tide of change. But the tide rises ever higher.\n\nI've heard tell of those who feel the Church's embrace grow cold, who find its pronouncements a burden rather than a blessing. They seek solace elsewhere, in a faith that bends with the times, that recognizes the complexities of the human heart.\n\nThe Church might cling to its ancient ways, but the world moves on. Whether it can weather the storm, whether it can find a way to bridge the chasm that widens, remains to be seen.",
            "The notion of marriage, a man and a woman joined, that's the way things have always been. But now they say two men can join, or two women.  It don't feel right. Like a wrong turn taken down a dusty road. They say it's a choice, but the heart don't choose. It just is.  \n\nI don't think the government has a say in how the heart beats. It's a thing between people, between souls.  \n\nThese folks, they're born that way, just like the rest of us. Can't blame a sparrow for its wings. Can't blame a man for how he feels. \n\nThe government, they got enough to worry about without meddling in the affairs of the heart. Leave that to the Lord, or maybe to the wind.",
            "The marriage of men to men. A thing they call unnatural. A stain upon the fabric of the family. But what is natural? What is family? Two souls bound by a hunger, a need, a truth that sings in the bone. Is it not the same song, sung in different keys?\n\nThey say it threatens the heterosexual norm. That it unravels the threads of society. But what of the threads already frayed, the seams already splitting? What of the young hearts yearning for love, for acceptance, for a place to call home? Are we to deny them this, to cast them out, to tell them their love is less than, their bonds weaker? \n\nThe law, they say, is the shield of the righteous. But what of the law that denies the very right to exist? To be seen? To be whole? To share in the light and the shadow of a life together?  They speak of property and healthcare, of rights and responsibilities. But these are merely tools, mere instruments in the grand orchestra of life. The music itself, the melody of love, transcends such earthly concerns.\n\nThey talk of churches and states, of separation and entanglement. But can love be contained by such flimsy walls? Can it be bargained for, traded, or legislated away? They cling to scripture, to dogma, to pronouncements from the pulpit. But the whisper of the heart, the echo of the soul, speaks a language older than any book.\n\nAnd what of the children? They fear what they do not understand. But children are resilient, adaptable creatures. They learn from love, from compassion, from the warmth of a home built on acceptance, not judgment.\n\nLet us not be blinded by fear. Let us not be swayed by prejudice. Let us not allow the darkness to win. Let us choose love. Let us choose justice. Let us choose equality. For in the end, it is not the law that defines us, but the love that binds us.",

Even the morning masses, the ones I used to dress for, folks are in jeans and khakis.  Casual.\n\nThat's the thing that strikes you.  The change.  Ain't no politics to it, just a shift in the air.  The church I know now, it's different.\n\nRegarding the men, the accusations...they're a stain.  But you can't tell me marriage would have stopped it.  There are men, married men, who prey.  It's not the vows, it's something else.  Some darkness they carry.\n\nThey choose this path, this priesthood.  They know the rules.  Other faiths, they allow marriage.  Seventh Heaven, that show, the preacher, he's got a wife and kids.  If a man craves that life, maybe he should look elsewhere.\n\nIt's a sickness, this pedophilia.  Genetics, maybe.

Sold a war on false pretenses, a betrayal of the very people they swore to protect.  Malfeasance, I call it.  Impeachable.  \n\nThey came in with blood in their hearts, those men.  Vengeance for a father, oil fields shimmering in their eyes.  The Constitution, a discarded parchment, trampled underfoot.  A thirst for power, a hunger for control.\n\nNow the country bleeds anew.  A swamp of warring factions, a parliament hollowed out by fear and ambition.  Sadr, a phantom, a name whispered in the dark, now sits with power in his grasp.

Democracy, they say. Another American outpost. A wellspring of oil. But blood stains the sand, and the ground cries out.\n\nIt's a slow burn, this war.  A festering wound.  They build schools, they say, but the bombs keep falling. They try to teach freedom, but the shadows of fear linger.  If we leave, they'll be left to pick up the pieces, to rebuild a world shattered by our hands.  And if we stay, will we ever truly leave?  Will we erase their history, their way of life, and replace it with our own?\n\nThe President, he carries the weight of it all.  A burden on his shoulders.  They call him names, whisper of another Vietnam.  A war without end, a stain on the nation's soul.  \n\nHe looks out at the faces of the families, the mothers and fathers, the sons and daughters.  They want their loved ones home. They want an end to the sorrow.  But the desert whispers, and the ghosts of the fallen linger.

To force their own sins on others? That's a defiance of the very words etched in stone.  \n\nThose who'd make it illegal, they choose one church's dogma over another. The Catholics, the Christians, most look upon it with scorn. But let the man in the pulpit preach, let the sinner listen. It ain't the government's place to decide what sins are buried and which ones rise. \n\nSeparation, that's what built this country. A haven for every creed, every belief. To amend it now, to shackle the soul, that's a path to damnation. It'd be the only amendment that chains the people, not the power. A backward step, a stain on the soul of this land.\n\nLet the churches decide their own battles. Let the government tend to roads and bridges. This ain't their fight. No, sir. It's between the man and his God, and that's a reckoning for another time.",

The government spun a yarn, played on fear, and the people, wounded and raw, swallowed it whole. 2003. A nation marched into the desert,  a sun-baked landscape that would become a graveyard.\n\nThey called it preemptive. A strike against the darkness before it found them. But war is a wound that festers, a beast that cannot be caged.  \n\nIt echoes, this war, with the ghosts of Vietnam. A quagmire, a struggle for a soul that isn't yours to claim.  They went in, boots on the sand,  to build a new order, a democracy. But the desert doesn't yield so easily. \n\nThey toppled the old king, the old ways, but the void is a hungry thing. Chaos bloomed. And the old wounds, they festered anew. How do you build a nation on the bones of the broken? They tried, these men, these soldiers, in the heat and the dust, but the insurgents were shadows, whispers in the wind. Fighting a ghost is a losing battle.\n\nThey were promised a swift victory. A clean sweep. But wars are rarely clean. They leave scars, not just on the land, but on the soul.\n\nThe blood spilled, the boys sent home in boxes, a sacrifice for what?  For oil, perhaps? For power? For an ideal that the desert couldn't comprehend? \n\nWe're still there, years later, watching the slow, agonizing dance of rebuilding. A nation broken, trying to find its way. And the question lingers: was it worth it? Was it ever worth it?",

A political football.\n\nI believe in that love. Always have. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, it matters not. It's a fire in the blood, a current in the soul. Not some choice made at a dinner table or in some church pew. It's a thing of nature.\n\nThese politicians, they speak of God's will. But who are they to play God? Who are they to judge the desires of the heart?  What do they know of the ache of longing, the pull of something deeper than the flesh?  \n\nLook around. There are families in every corner, bound not by laws, but by love. Families built on laughter and shared dreams, on whispered secrets and hands clasped together in the dark.  They walk the streets, they raise their children, they live their lives, just as any other family.\n\nAnd what are they denied by these laws? What right is taken from them? The right to love? The right to build a life together? It's a cruel joke, a mockery of humanity.\n\nLet them love. Let them be. It's not for us to tell them otherwise. It's their story, their journey, their right.",

To bring light to a land shrouded in darkness. But the light, it seems, has flickered and died. Now it’s a different beast altogether. A hunger, a need to prove something. To be the strong hand, the iron fist. \n\nThe reasons, they were murky from the start.  A father's old scores settled on a son's battlefield.  A legacy built on shadows.  If the aim was to lift a people from tyranny, then good. That, at least, was a reason worthy of blood. But the blood, it spills on and on.  \n\nThey said the start was enough. A statement, a show of force.  But the statement ran on, a broken record scratching across time. Years bleed into years. The purpose, it wears thin.  The enemy, they adapt.  We, we become the monsters we sought to destroy. \n\nThere comes a time when a man must stand alone.  When the fight becomes a burden, a stain on the soul. We've bled ourselves dry, pouring our wealth into a bottomless pit.  While our own streets crumble, our own children hunger.  \n\nThe money, it could build schools, mend roads, heal the sick. Instead, it feeds the machine of war.  A machine that grinds on, fueled by fear and pride, with no end in sight. \n\nIt's time to let go. Time to turn the tide, to find another path.  Time to face the demons within ourselves, and build a world worthy of the sacrifices made.",
            "The question hung in the air, a thin wisp of smoke. Prevented, he said. By someone sifting through the digital dust, finding a spark in the static. A violation, maybe. Or was it? On those sites, the MySpaces and Facebooks, the lines blurred. Information spilled out like water from a cracked dam. Once put out there, it belonged to the wind. You gave it away when you pressed that button, when you clicked accept. A friend, a stranger, it didn't matter. They saw what you let them see.\n\nHe paused, the weight of the words settling like ash in his throat. To watch over them all, to sift through the digital lives of every student, that seemed a lonely task. A cruel one. But what if it was necessary? What if a life hung in the balance? A single profile, a whispered warning, a glimpse into the darkness.\n\nHe thought of the man on the screen, the one who'd shown how easy it was to pry into the lives of others. A screen name here, a message there, a meeting arranged in minutes. He thought of the classmates who knew his name, his habits, his friends, without ever having met him face to face. The fear, the unease, the feeling of being watched, even when alone.\n\nHe remembered the story of the high school, the ban on Myspace. A school trying to control the uncontrollable. A futile gesture, a thin wall against the flood. Was it privacy they were trying to protect, or something else? He didn't know.\n\nAll he knew was the world had changed. The lines had blurred. And the things that were once private were now for anyone who cared to look.",
            "The war. A word that tastes like ash in the mouth. I don't like to join the chorus, the ones who claim they were against it from the start. But the truth is, the air was thick with it, the bad scent of it. It hung over everything.  Most folks knew. Even the men in suits, they knew it was a mistake, but pride, it's a stubborn thing. They'd rather choke on their own lies than admit they were wrong. \n\nThe polls, they tell the story. Seventy-five, eighty percent. All over the world, they see it for what it is: a wound that festers. Even in the desert, where the sand whispers secrets, they know.  The soldiers, those boys sent to bleed on that cursed soil, they know too. They say they're better off gone. \n\nIt was a disaster before we even stepped foot there, a bad seed planted in fertile ground. Now, pulling out, it's like trying to untangle a knotted rope, the more you pull, the more tangled it gets.  \n\nThe gulf between us, it's vast. Cultures clash, a symphony of discord. They think democracy can be force-fed, like some kind of cheap medicine. They don't understand.  Saddam, a monster, yes. But is that a reason to unleash another?\n\nWe're stuck in quicksand, drowning in it. There's no exit, only a slow, agonizing descent. I don't know what to say, except to get out. Leave them to their own devices.  Let them decide their own fate. \n\nThey've been telling us to leave for years. They know better. We stand there, a monument to our own hubris. The good guys? No. Never. But there's a flicker of hope, a chance to walk away from the slaughter, a chance to start again.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and forgotten things.  The question, it settled on him like a shroud. Gender.  A sickness in the bones of the country. He felt it, sure as a sunrise followed by the sting of cold wind.  Not just on the women, though they bore the brunt of it.  The scales tipped different in every valley, every field of work.  \n\nWomen, they had the glass roof, a ceiling made of whispered expectations. Even with equality on their lips, men still chafed at the thought of a woman in command.  The old ways, they clung to them like moss on a tombstone. A woman with the qualifications, the drive, the fire in her eyes, still found herself looking up, not at the top, but at a wall.  A wall built of prejudice, cemented by generations of men who thought the world belonged to them.\n\nAnd the men, they weren't free either.  In the world of fashion, a man in a finely tailored suit could be met with suspicion.  His taste questionable, his motives suspect.  The world, it saw a man in a world of lace and silk, and it recoiled. \n\nStaying home, raising children, a man doing that?  A strange sight, like a bird flying backwards.  Society, it judged, it pointed fingers, it whispered about what a man *should* be doing.  Working, providing, the lifeblood of the family.  But what about the dreams that whispered in the quiet hours? What about the heart that yearned to nurture and guide?  They were buried, like seeds in the hard earth, under the weight of expectation.\n\nChange, it was slow, a river carving its path through stone.  But it was happening. Women rising, men breaking free from the chains of what was expected of them.  The world was a tapestry, woven with threads of difference, and it was time to let those threads shine.",
            "They didn't legalize it. No. Decriminalized. Dropped it down. From a crime to a citation. Like a parking ticket. You get a notice, not the wagon. No booking, no jail. It lingers though, even lessened. Job interviews, all that. The stain of the charge, even if it ain't on your record.\n\nSee, it costs. Arrest, court, housing, lawyers. A whole apparatus churning. And towns, strapped for cash, they cling to the revenue. Even when it means locking up folks for a leaf. \n\nBut in places like Denver, where the wind blows a little different, they see the dollar signs. Money for schools, for the old folks, for the hungry. A trade-off.\n\nBut the open air, the streets... that's a different kind of reckoning. Like cigarettes, sold at every gas pump? Everywhere... smoke hanging in the air. Driving, dazed. Not right. It’s still a shadow thing.  \n\nThey say alcohol’s worse, for the hands, for the mind. But weed, it gets in your bones. Changes you.  \n\nAnd folks, they don't react the same. Some go full throttle, others tread light.  The devil's in the individual.",
            "The church. A place of old ways. Of timeworn rituals and doctrines etched in stone.  A comfort to some, a cage to others. They cling to their traditions, these Catholics, as if the world were a shifting tide that threatened to sweep them away. But the world changes. The wind blows. And sometimes, the old ways can suffocate the soul.\n\nThey speak of tolerance, of love for all. Yet they turn their backs on those who don't fit their narrow mold. My father, an Episcopalian, was deemed unworthy.  My mother, a Catholic, forced to choose between faith and family. A marriage denied, a love condemned. Hypocrisy hangs heavy in the air, thick as incense.\n\nThe scriptures speak of love, but the practice whispers of judgment. They speak of forgiveness, but their pronouncements sting like lashes. The doctrines, ancient and dusty, offer little solace in a world where shadows lengthen and questions deepen.\n\nThey say allowing priests to marry would invite chaos. That it would stain the sacred cloth with the mire of earthly desires. But what of the stain that already lingers, the darkness that festers in the heart of man? Can a sacrament truly cleanse a soul burdened with such sin? \n\nThe child, innocent and vulnerable, becomes a victim in this twisted game. And the priest, cloaked in robes of power, becomes the predator.  Love and forgiveness, these are hollow words when uttered by those who turn a blind eye to the suffering they perpetuate.\n\nChange is coming. The tide is turning. And the old ways will crumble.",
            "This matter, it’s a tangled thing. No easy answers. The line between the church’s domain and the state’s, a thin one.  And how to define marriage, to speak it into being, well that’s a dance on a knife’s edge. To offend none, a near impossibility.  \n\nI’ve thought on it, long thought. This civil union, it’s a thing. Two souls bound. Should the government, they who tax the living and bury the dead, have a say in the sacrament of it all? Baptism, communion, these things are between the soul and the heavens. The state takes no interest.  And marriage, should it be no different? A union, a joining, that’s all it is. No need for government’s stamp of approval, their blessing. \n\nStates, they can come to their own understanding, their own conclusions. But this talk of amendments, of tearing at the very fabric of the Constitution, over a matter of the heart, it’s a hollow pursuit.  Some may cry for it, some may need it, but this cause, it’s not a tremor that shakes the foundations of the nation. \n\nNo, it’s something far simpler, far more human. Two souls bound. Two lives entwined.",
            "The man raised in the house of God. Home was a place of cross and hymn and the weight of scripture. But the world outside, the world of boys he knew, the world of affection that folded in on itself like a prayer, that was a different kind of geography. A place where lines blurred and shadows stretched. He saw the good in them, the way they loved and held, the way their laughter echoed in the night. Yet the teachings, the truths laid down, they sat heavy in his gut like a stone.  \n\nHe believed their right to choose, to love, should be theirs alone. Not the business of the state, not the decree of a man in a high office.  For the South was different from the North, the plains from the mountains. Each place its own creed, its own dance with light and shadow.  The law, it should follow the land, the people, the breath of the earth.  It shouldn't be handed down from on high, a single edict for a land as vast and varied as this.  \n\nLet the states decide. Let them wrestle with the question, let them find their own answer. For in the end, it was the people who lived with the consequences, not the man in the suit, not the one who held the power. And power, he knew, was a dangerous thing, a river that could drown a man if he allowed it.",
            "The way I see it, Myspace is a public place. Like a bulletin board. Open to all. If you post somethin', you're puttin' it out there.  Anyone can see it. School folks included. \n\nNow, if you think they can't see it just 'cause they're not usin' the school's name, you're wrong. They can get to it from home. From anywhere.\n\nBut let me tell you somethin'. If it stops a school shootin', if it saves those kids, then I say they had the right to look. It's the school's responsibility. They gotta keep those kids safe.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's right to go snoopin' through kids' profiles just lookin' for trouble.  Catchin' 'em drinkin' or smokin', that ain't right. That's an invasion. But if they got a lead, somethin' that could stop somethin' bad from happenin', then I say they should do what they gotta do.\n\nIt's a line, ain't it?  You put somethin' out there, you gotta be ready for it to come back.  Like a boomerang. The internet ain't forgetful.  \n\nI've heard tell that even emails get dug up later. Years down the road.  Somethin' you thought was private, gone and come back to bite you.\n\nIt's a dangerous world out there. And sometimes, safety comes first.",
            "The war. A kind of fever. It took hold after the fall. A wound opened, raw and bleeding. Nine Eleven. A day seared into the bone. I remember the rage. The need for vengeance. To take the fight to them. To break them. \n\nBut the fire cooled. The dust settled. And the truth began to show. We went in blind. No map, no plan. Just the echo of the fall, a hollow drumbeat in the desert. We thought to bring order, to bring light. But the land was already steeped in darkness. \n\nThey fight amongst themselves, these people.  Sons against sons. Brother against brother. What good is war against a shadow? We were no savior. Just another force in the endless churn.  \n\nThe president, he spoke of freedom, of liberation. But freedom tasted like dust in the wind. A hollow promise. We left a scar on the land, not a blessing. \n\nMaybe it was always hopeless. Maybe we were never meant to change them.  Maybe we were just meant to fight. To leave them to their own devices, their own savage dance. \n\nNow the anger has faded. A weary resignation hangs in the air. We built nothing lasting. Just ghosts. And the dust."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. It speaks of things long past, of sins and sacraments, of a time when the world held different truths. Yet the world has turned, the wind has shifted. And the whispers grow louder. They say the pews are emptying, the flock scattering. The old doctrines, once ironclad, now seem brittle, cracked by the weight of modern doubt.\n\nThey speak of marriage, of love between men and between women, of choice in the matter of life's beginning. These are things the Church holds fast against, a wall of dogma built against the tide of change. But the tide rises ever higher.\n\nI've heard tell of those who feel the Church's embrace grow cold, who find its pronouncements a burden rather than a blessing. They seek solace elsewhere, in a faith that bends with the times, that recognizes the complexities of the human heart.\n\nThe Church might cling to its ancient ways, but the world moves on. Whether it can weather the storm, whether it can find a way to bridge the chasm that widens, remains to be seen.",
            "The notion of marriage, a man and a woman joined, that's the way things have always been. But now they say two men can join, or two women.  It don't feel right. Like a wrong turn taken down a dusty road. They say it's a choice, but the heart don't choose. It just is.  \n\nI don't think the government has a say in how the heart beats. It's a thing between people, between souls.  \n\nThese folks, they're born that way, just like the rest of us. Can't blame a sparrow for its wings. Can't blame a man for how he feels. \n\nThe government, they got enough to worry about without meddling in the affairs of the heart. Leave that to the Lord, or maybe to the wind.",
            "The marriage of men to men. A thing they call unnatural. A stain upon the fabric of the family. But what is natural? What is family? Two souls bound by a hunger, a need, a truth that sings in the bone. Is it not the same song, sung in different keys?\n\nThey say it threatens the heterosexual norm. That it unravels the threads of society. But what of the threads already frayed, the seams already splitting? What of the young hearts yearning for love, for acceptance, for a place to call home? Are we to deny them this, to cast them out, to tell them their love is less than, their bonds weaker? \n\nThe law, they say, is the shield of the righteous. But what of the law that denies the very right to exist? To be seen? To be whole? To share in the light and the shadow of a life together?  They speak of property and healthcare, of rights and responsibilities. But these are merely tools, mere instruments in the grand orchestra of life. The music itself, the melody of love, transcends such earthly concerns.\n\nThey talk of churches and states, of separation and entanglement. But can love be contained by such flimsy walls? Can it be bargained for, traded, or legislated away? They cling to scripture, to dogma, to pronouncements from the pulpit. But the whisper of the heart, the echo of the soul, speaks a language older than any book.\n\nAnd what of the children? They fear what they do not understand. But children are resilient, adaptable creatures. They learn from love, from compassion, from the warmth of a home built on acceptance, not judgment.\n\nLet us not be blinded by fear. Let us not be swayed by prejudice. Let us not allow the darkness to win. Let us choose love. Let us choose justice. Let us choose equality. For in the end, it is not the law that defines us, but the love that binds us.",

They say a drug's illegality speaks to its worth, but that's a lie the law tells itself.  There's good in some things the law keeps out.  Medicine, they call it. Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets.  Controlled.  But controlled for who?  The people who need them? The ones who suffer?  Marijuana, they say.  Taboo.  But why?  What's the harm in easing the ache, the pain?  It ain't no heroin, no cocaine.  Just a whisper of relief.  A shadow in the corner of the eye.  We fear what we don't understand.  That's how the darkness wins.  Let the light in.  Let them use it.  Let them heal.",
            "The church, it's changed.  Softened. Not the iron fist it once was. I remember Sundays. Dresses. Shoes. A purse to match. Sunday school. All of us in our finery. A parade of innocence.  \n\nNow, they have these teen masses. Thirty minutes. In and out. Folks in beach clothes, still damp from the salt, families hurrying in late.  Even the morning masses, the ones I used to dress for, folks are in jeans and khakis.  Casual.\n\nThat's the thing that strikes you.  The change.  Ain't no politics to it, just a shift in the air.  The church I know now, it's different.\n\nRegarding the men, the accusations...they're a stain.  But you can't tell me marriage would have stopped it.  There are men, married men, who prey.  It's not the vows, it's something else.  Some darkness they carry.\n\nThey choose this path, this priesthood.  They know the rules.  Other faiths, they allow marriage.  Seventh Heaven, that show, the preacher, he's got a wife and kids.  If a man craves that life, maybe he should look elsewhere.\n\nIt's a sickness, this pedophilia.  Genetics, maybe.  Something hardwired.  Can't be changed with a wedding ring.  They may try to hide it, but it always bleeds out. The church, they should've known, should've done better.  But maybe, just maybe, some things are beyond their reach.",

Bin Laden, Hussein, weapons of mass destruction.  A tangled web of lies spun by men in suits, men who spoke with forked tongues. Powell, himself, later admitted he'd been blind.  Sold a war on false pretenses, a betrayal of the very people they swore to protect.  Malfeasance, I call it.  Impeachable.  \n\nThey came in with blood in their hearts, those men.  Vengeance for a father, oil fields shimmering in their eyes.  The Constitution, a discarded parchment, trampled underfoot.  A thirst for power, a hunger for control.\n\nNow the country bleeds anew.  A swamp of warring factions, a parliament hollowed out by fear and ambition.  Sadr, a phantom, a name whispered in the dark, now sits with power in his grasp.  The future, a canvas stained with the blood of the innocent.  \n\nNo easy answers, no clean exits.  Just the slow, grinding churn of history repeating itself.",
            "The desert wind. It scours the land bare.  Same as the war. Leaves nothing but dust and ruin. The Iraq thing. A shadow hanging over the country. A pointless fight, some might say.  No declaration, just a whisper of justification. They say it was payback, for the smoke and the ash that fell on that bright September day.  But what good comes from the desert's sting?  Democracy, they say. Another American outpost. A wellspring of oil. But blood stains the sand, and the ground cries out.\n\nIt's a slow burn, this war.  A festering wound.  They build schools, they say, but the bombs keep falling. They try to teach freedom, but the shadows of fear linger.  If we leave, they'll be left to pick up the pieces, to rebuild a world shattered by our hands.  And if we stay, will we ever truly leave?  Will we erase their history, their way of life, and replace it with our own?\n\nThe President, he carries the weight of it all.  A burden on his shoulders.  They call him names, whisper of another Vietnam.  A war without end, a stain on the nation's soul.  \n\nHe looks out at the faces of the families, the mothers and fathers, the sons and daughters.  They want their loved ones home. They want an end to the sorrow.  But the desert whispers, and the ghosts of the fallen linger.  The echo of gunfire, the screams of the wounded, the scent of death on the wind.  It's a tangled web, this war. No easy answers, no simple solutions. Only the dust and the silence.",

To force their own sins on others? That's a defiance of the very words etched in stone.  \n\nThose who'd make it illegal, they choose one church's dogma over another. The Catholics, the Christians, most look upon it with scorn. But let the man in the pulpit preach, let the sinner listen. It ain't the government's place to decide what sins are buried and which ones rise. \n\nSeparation, that's what built this country. A haven for every creed, every belief. To amend it now, to shackle the soul, that's a path to damnation. It'd be the only amendment that chains the people, not the power. A backward step, a stain on the soul of this land.\n\nLet the churches decide their own battles. Let the government tend to roads and bridges. This ain't their fight. No, sir. It's between the man and his God, and that's a reckoning for another time.",

The government spun a yarn, played on fear, and the people, wounded and raw, swallowed it whole. 2003. A nation marched into the desert,  a sun-baked landscape that would become a graveyard.\n\nThey called it preemptive. A strike against the darkness before it found them. But war is a wound that festers, a beast that cannot be caged.  \n\nIt echoes, this war, with the ghosts of Vietnam. A quagmire, a struggle for a soul that isn't yours to claim.  They went in, boots on the sand,  to build a new order, a democracy. But the desert doesn't yield so easily. \n\nThey toppled the old king, the old ways, but the void is a hungry thing. Chaos bloomed. And the old wounds, they festered anew. How do you build a nation on the bones of the broken? They tried, these men, these soldiers, in the heat and the dust, but the insurgents were shadows, whispers in the wind. Fighting a ghost is a losing battle.\n\nThey were promised a swift victory. A clean sweep. But wars are rarely clean. They leave scars, not just on the land, but on the soul.\n\nThe blood spilled, the boys sent home in boxes, a sacrifice for what?  For oil, perhaps? For power? For an ideal that the desert couldn't comprehend? \n\nWe're still there, years later, watching the slow, agonizing dance of rebuilding. A nation broken, trying to find its way. And the question lingers: was it worth it? Was it ever worth it?",

It’s a word that should mean no more than two souls choosing to walk together under the same sun. Love, in its simplest form. But they make it a battleground. A political football.\n\nI believe in that love. Always have. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, it matters not. It's a fire in the blood, a current in the soul. Not some choice made at a dinner table or in some church pew. It's a thing of nature.\n\nThese politicians, they speak of God's will. But who are they to play God? Who are they to judge the desires of the heart?  What do they know of the ache of longing, the pull of something deeper than the flesh?  \n\nLook around. There are families in every corner, bound not by laws, but by love. Families built on laughter and shared dreams, on whispered secrets and hands clasped together in the dark.  They walk the streets, they raise their children, they live their lives, just as any other family.\n\nAnd what are they denied by these laws? What right is taken from them? The right to love? The right to build a life together? It's a cruel joke, a mockery of humanity.\n\nLet them love. Let them be. It's not for us to tell them otherwise. It's their story, their journey, their right.",

Like flyshit on a dusty window.\"\n\nHe paused, eyes fixed on some unseen point in the distance. \"As a resident advisor, I've seen it. Heard it. A kid talking about blowing things up, about shootings. Someone hears it, someone tells. The school has to act. God forbid something happens. Their asses are on the line. Silence can be taken for complicity.\"\n\nA shadow crossed his face. \"But you don't know what's real anymore. Kids slinging words like stones, testing the wind. Could be a joke. Could be a bad experiment gone sour. A sociology class, something like that. Or it could be the real thing. The thing that makes your blood run cold.\"\n\nHe looked at me, eyes hard. \"A kid's whispered words, overheard in the hallway. A friend, worried, combing through Facebook, finding things that seem harmless, until they don't. The internet, it's a mirror. Reflects back what you put in. But it's also a weapon.

To bring light to a land shrouded in darkness. But the light, it seems, has flickered and died. Now it’s a different beast altogether. A hunger, a need to prove something. To be the strong hand, the iron fist. \n\nThe reasons, they were murky from the start.  A father's old scores settled on a son's battlefield.  A legacy built on shadows.  If the aim was to lift a people from tyranny, then good. That, at least, was a reason worthy of blood. But the blood, it spills on and on.  \n\nThey said the start was enough. A statement, a show of force.  But the statement ran on, a broken record scratching across time. Years bleed into years. The purpose, it wears thin.  The enemy, they adapt.  We, we become the monsters we sought to destroy. \n\nThere comes a time when a man must stand alone.  When the fight becomes a burden, a stain on the soul. We've bled ourselves dry, pouring our wealth into a bottomless pit.  While our own streets crumble, our own children hunger.  \n\nThe money, it could build schools, mend roads, heal the sick. Instead, it feeds the machine of war.  A machine that grinds on, fueled by fear and pride, with no end in sight. \n\nIt's time to let go. Time to turn the tide, to find another path.

            "The question hung in the air, a thin wisp of smoke. Prevented, he said. By someone sifting through the digital dust, finding a spark in the static. A violation, maybe. Or was it? On those sites, the MySpaces and Facebooks, the lines blurred. Information spilled out like water from a cracked dam. Once put out there, it belonged to the wind. You gave it away when you pressed that button, when you clicked accept. A friend, a stranger, it didn't matter. They saw what you let them see.\n\nHe paused, the weight of the words settling like ash in his throat. To watch over them all, to sift through the digital lives of every student, that seemed a lonely task. A cruel one. But what if it was necessary? What if a life hung in the balance? A single profile, a whispered warning, a glimpse into the darkness.\n\nHe thought of the man on the screen, the one who'd shown how easy it was to pry into the lives of others. A screen name here, a message there, a meeting arranged in minutes. He thought of the classmates who knew his name, his habits, his friends, without ever having met him face to face. The fear, the unease, the feeling of being watched, even when alone.\n\nHe remembered the story of the high school, the ban on Myspace. A school trying to control the uncontrollable. A futile gesture, a thin wall against the flood. Was it privacy they were trying to protect, or something else? He didn't know.\n\nAll he knew was the world had changed. The lines had blurred. And the things that were once private were now for anyone who cared to look.",

But the truth is, the air was thick with it, the bad scent of it. It hung over everything.  Most folks knew. Even the men in suits, they knew it was a mistake, but pride, it's a stubborn thing. They'd rather choke on their own lies than admit they were wrong. \n\nThe polls, they tell the story. Seventy-five, eighty percent. All over the world, they see it for what it is: a wound that festers. Even in the desert, where the sand whispers secrets, they know.  The soldiers, those boys sent to bleed on that cursed soil, they know too. They say they're better off gone. \n\nIt was a disaster before we even stepped foot there, a bad seed planted in fertile ground. Now, pulling out, it's like trying to untangle a knotted rope, the more you pull, the more tangled it gets.  \n\nThe gulf between us, it's vast. Cultures clash, a symphony of discord. They think democracy can be force-fed, like some kind of cheap medicine. They don't understand.  Saddam, a monster, yes. But is that a reason to unleash another?\n\nWe're stuck in quicksand, drowning in it. There's no exit, only a slow, agonizing descent. I don't know what to say, except to get out. Leave them to their own devices.  Let them decide their own fate. \n\nThey've been telling us to leave for years. They know better. We stand there, a monument to our own hubris. The good guys? No. Never. But there's a flicker of hope, a chance to walk away from the slaughter, a chance to start again.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and forgotten things.  The question, it settled on him like a shroud. Gender.  A sickness in the bones of the country. He felt it, sure as a sunrise followed by the sting of cold wind.  Not just on the women, though they bore the brunt of it.  The scales tipped different in every valley, every field of work.  \n\nWomen, they had the glass roof, a ceiling made of whispered expectations. Even with equality on their lips, men still chafed at the thought of a woman in command.  The old ways, they clung to them like moss on a tombstone. A woman with the qualifications, the drive, the fire in her eyes, still found herself looking up, not at the top, but at a wall.  A wall built of prejudice, cemented by generations of men who thought the world belonged to them.\n\nAnd the men, they weren't free either.  In the world of fashion, a man in a finely tailored suit could be met with suspicion.  His taste questionable, his motives suspect.  The world, it saw a man in a world of lace and silk, and it recoiled. \n\nStaying home, raising children, a man doing that?  A strange sight, like a bird flying backwards.  Society, it judged, it pointed fingers, it whispered about what a man *should* be doing.  Working, providing, the lifeblood of the family.  But what about the dreams that whispered in the quiet hours? What about the heart that yearned to nurture and guide?  They were buried, like seeds in the hard earth, under the weight of expectation.\n\nChange, it was slow, a river carving its path through stone.  But it was happening. Women rising, men breaking free from the chains of what was expected of them.  The world was a tapestry, woven with threads of difference, and it was time to let those threads shine.",
            "They didn't legalize it. No. Decriminalized. Dropped it down. From a crime to a citation. Like a parking ticket. You get a notice, not the wagon. No booking, no jail. It lingers though, even lessened. Job interviews, all that. The stain of the charge, even if it ain't on your record.\n\nSee, it costs. Arrest, court, housing, lawyers. A whole apparatus churning. And towns, strapped for cash, they cling to the revenue. Even when it means locking up folks for a leaf. \n\nBut in places like Denver, where the wind blows a little different, they see the dollar signs. Money for schools, for the old folks, for the hungry. A trade-off.\n\nBut the open air, the streets... that's a different kind of reckoning. Like cigarettes, sold at every gas pump? Everywhere... smoke hanging in the air. Driving, dazed. Not right. It’s still a shadow thing.  \n\nThey say alcohol’s worse, for the hands, for the mind. But weed, it gets in your bones. Changes you.  \n\nAnd folks, they don't react the same. Some go full throttle, others tread light.  The devil's in the individual.",
            "The church. A place of old ways. Of timeworn rituals and doctrines etched in stone.  A comfort to some, a cage to others. They cling to their traditions, these Catholics, as if the world were a shifting tide that threatened to sweep them away. But the world changes. The wind blows. And sometimes, the old ways can suffocate the soul.\n\nThey speak of tolerance, of love for all. Yet they turn their backs on those who don't fit their narrow mold. My father, an Episcopalian, was deemed unworthy.  My mother, a Catholic, forced to choose between faith and family. A marriage denied, a love condemned. Hypocrisy hangs heavy in the air, thick as incense.\n\nThe scriptures speak of love, but the practice whispers of judgment. They speak of forgiveness, but their pronouncements sting like lashes. The doctrines, ancient and dusty, offer little solace in a world where shadows lengthen and questions deepen.\n\nThey say allowing priests to marry would invite chaos. That it would stain the sacred cloth with the mire of earthly desires. But what of the stain that already lingers, the darkness that festers in the heart of man? Can a sacrament truly cleanse a soul burdened with such sin? \n\nThe child, innocent and vulnerable, becomes a victim in this twisted game. And the priest, cloaked in robes of power, becomes the predator.  Love and forgiveness, these are hollow words when uttered by those who turn a blind eye to the suffering they perpetuate.\n\nChange is coming. The tide is turning. And the old ways will crumble.",
            "This matter, it’s a tangled thing. No easy answers. The line between the church’s domain and the state’s, a thin one.  And how to define marriage, to speak it into being, well that’s a dance on a knife’s edge. To offend none, a near impossibility.  \n\nI’ve thought on it, long thought. This civil union, it’s a thing. Two souls bound. Should the government, they who tax the living and bury the dead, have a say in the sacrament of it all? Baptism, communion, these things are between the soul and the heavens. The state takes no interest.  And marriage, should it be no different? A union, a joining, that’s all it is. No need for government’s stamp of approval, their blessing. \n\nStates, they can come to their own understanding, their own conclusions. But this talk of amendments, of tearing at the very fabric of the Constitution, over a matter of the heart, it’s a hollow pursuit.  Some may cry for it, some may need it, but this cause, it’s not a tremor that shakes the foundations of the nation. \n\nNo, it’s something far simpler, far more human. Two souls bound. Two lives entwined.",
            "The man raised in the house of God. Home was a place of cross and hymn and the weight of scripture. But the world outside, the world of boys he knew, the world of affection that folded in on itself like a prayer, that was a different kind of geography. A place where lines blurred and shadows stretched. He saw the good in them, the way they loved and held, the way their laughter echoed in the night. Yet the teachings, the truths laid down, they sat heavy in his gut like a stone.  \n\nHe believed their right to choose, to love, should be theirs alone. Not the business of the state, not the decree of a man in a high office.  For the South was different from the North, the plains from the mountains. Each place its own creed, its own dance with light and shadow.  The law, it should follow the land, the people, the breath of the earth.  It shouldn't be handed down from on high, a single edict for a land as vast and varied as this.  \n\nLet the states decide. Let them wrestle with the question, let them find their own answer. For in the end, it was the people who lived with the consequences, not the man in the suit, not the one who held the power. And power, he knew, was a dangerous thing, a river that could drown a man if he allowed it.",
            "The way I see it, Myspace is a public place. Like a bulletin board. Open to all. If you post somethin', you're puttin' it out there.  Anyone can see it. School folks included. \n\nNow, if you think they can't see it just 'cause they're not usin' the school's name, you're wrong. They can get to it from home. From anywhere.\n\nBut let me tell you somethin'. If it stops a school shootin', if it saves those kids, then I say they had the right to look. It's the school's responsibility. They gotta keep those kids safe.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's right to go snoopin' through kids' profiles just lookin' for trouble.  Catchin' 'em drinkin' or smokin', that ain't right. That's an invasion. But if they got a lead, somethin' that could stop somethin' bad from happenin', then I say they should do what they gotta do.\n\nIt's a line, ain't it?  You put somethin' out there, you gotta be ready for it to come back.  Like a boomerang. The internet ain't forgetful.  \n\nI've heard tell that even emails get dug up later. Years down the road.  Somethin' you thought was private, gone and come back to bite you.\n\nIt's a dangerous world out there. And sometimes, safety comes first.",
            "The war. A kind of fever. It took hold after the fall. A wound opened, raw and bleeding. Nine Eleven. A day seared into the bone. I remember the rage. The need for vengeance. To take the fight to them. To break them. \n\nBut the fire cooled. The dust settled. And the truth began to show. We went in blind. No map, no plan. Just the echo of the fall, a hollow drumbeat in the desert. We thought to bring order, to bring light. But the land was already steeped in darkness. \n\nThey fight amongst themselves, these people.  Sons against sons. Brother against brother. What good is war against a shadow? We were no savior. Just another force in the endless churn.  \n\nThe president, he spoke of freedom, of liberation. But freedom tasted like dust in the wind. A hollow promise. We left a scar on the land, not a blessing. \n\nMaybe it was always hopeless. Maybe we were never meant to change them.  Maybe we were just meant to fight. To leave them to their own devices, their own savage dance. \n\nNow the anger has faded. A weary resignation hangs in the air. We built nothing lasting. Just ghosts. And the dust."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. It speaks of things long past, of sins and sacraments, of a time when the world held different truths. Yet the world has turned, the wind has shifted. And the whispers grow louder. They say the pews are emptying, the flock scattering. The old doctrines, once ironclad, now seem brittle, cracked by the weight of modern doubt.\n\nThey speak of marriage, of love between men and between women, of choice in the matter of life's beginning. These are things the Church holds fast against, a wall of dogma built against the tide of change. But the tide rises ever higher.\n\nI've heard tell of those who feel the Church's embrace grow cold, who find its pronouncements a burden rather than a blessing. They seek solace elsewhere, in a faith that bends with the times, that recognizes the complexities of the human heart.\n\nThe Church might cling to its ancient ways, but the world moves on. Whether it can weather the storm, whether it can find a way to bridge the chasm that widens, remains to be seen.",
            "The notion of marriage, a man and a woman joined, that's the way things have always been. But now they say two men can join, or two women.  It don't feel right. Like a wrong turn taken down a dusty road. They say it's a choice, but the heart don't choose. It just is.  \n\nI don't think the government has a say in how the heart beats. It's a thing between people, between souls.  \n\nThese folks, they're born that way, just like the rest of us. Can't blame a sparrow for its wings. Can't blame a man for how he feels. \n\nThe government, they got enough to worry about without meddling in the affairs of the heart. Leave that to the Lord, or maybe to the wind.",
            "The marriage of men to men. A thing they call unnatural. A stain upon the fabric of the family. But what is natural? What is family? Two souls bound by a hunger, a need, a truth that sings in the bone. Is it not the same song, sung in different keys?\n\nThey say it threatens the heterosexual norm. That it unravels the threads of society. But what of the threads already frayed, the seams already splitting? What of the young hearts yearning for love, for acceptance, for a place to call home? Are we to deny them this, to cast them out, to tell them their love is less than, their bonds weaker? \n\nThe law, they say, is the shield of the righteous. But what of the law that denies the very right to exist? To be seen? To be whole? To share in the light and the shadow of a life together?  They speak of property and healthcare, of rights and responsibilities. But these are merely tools, mere instruments in the grand orchestra of life. The music itself, the melody of love, transcends such earthly concerns.\n\nThey talk of churches and states, of separation and entanglement. But can love be contained by such flimsy walls? Can it be bargained for, traded, or legislated away? They cling to scripture, to dogma, to pronouncements from the pulpit. But the whisper of the heart, the echo of the soul, speaks a language older than any book.\n\nAnd what of the children? They fear what they do not understand. But children are resilient, adaptable creatures. They learn from love, from compassion, from the warmth of a home built on acceptance, not judgment.\n\nLet us not be blinded by fear. Let us not be swayed by prejudice. Let us not allow the darkness to win. Let us choose love. Let us choose justice. Let us choose equality. For in the end, it is not the law that defines us, but the love that binds us.",

They say a drug's illegality speaks to its worth, but that's a lie the law tells itself.  There's good in some things the law keeps out.  Medicine, they call it. Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets.  Controlled.  But controlled for who?  The people who need them? The ones who suffer?  Marijuana, they say.  Taboo.  But why?  What's the harm in easing the ache, the pain?  It ain't no heroin, no cocaine.  Just a whisper of relief.  A shadow in the corner of the eye.  We fear what we don't understand.  That's how the darkness wins.  Let the light in.  Let them use it.  Let them heal.",
            "The church, it's changed.  Softened. Not the iron fist it once was. I remember Sundays. Dresses. Shoes. A purse to match. Sunday school. All of us in our finery. A parade of innocence.  \n\nNow, they have these teen masses. Thirty minutes. In and out. Folks in beach clothes, still damp from the salt, families hurrying in late.  Even the morning masses, the ones I used to dress for, folks are in jeans and khakis.  Casual.\n\nThat's the thing that strikes you.  The change.  Ain't no politics to it, just a shift in the air.  The church I know now, it's different.\n\nRegarding the men, the accusations...they're a stain.  But you can't tell me marriage would have stopped it.  There are men, married men, who prey.  It's not the vows, it's something else.  Some darkness they carry.\n\nThey choose this path, this priesthood.  They know the rules.  Other faiths, they allow marriage.  Seventh Heaven, that show, the preacher, he's got a wife and kids.  If a man craves that life, maybe he should look elsewhere.\n\nIt's a sickness, this pedophilia.  Genetics, maybe.  Something hardwired.  Can't be changed with a wedding ring.  They may try to hide it, but it always bleeds out. The church, they should've known, should've done better.  But maybe, just maybe, some things are beyond their reach.",

Bin Laden, Hussein, weapons of mass destruction.  A tangled web of lies spun by men in suits, men who spoke with forked tongues. Powell, himself, later admitted he'd been blind.  Sold a war on false pretenses, a betrayal of the very people they swore to protect.  Malfeasance, I call it.  Impeachable.  \n\nThey came in with blood in their hearts, those men.  Vengeance for a father, oil fields shimmering in their eyes.  The Constitution, a discarded parchment, trampled underfoot.  A thirst for power, a hunger for control.\n\nNow the country bleeds anew.  A swamp of warring factions, a parliament hollowed out by fear and ambition.  Sadr, a phantom, a name whispered in the dark, now sits with power in his grasp.  The future, a canvas stained with the blood of the innocent.  \n\nNo easy answers, no clean exits.  Just the slow, grinding churn of history repeating itself.",
            "The desert wind. It scours the land bare.  Same as the war. Leaves nothing but dust and ruin. The Iraq thing. A shadow hanging over the country. A pointless fight, some might say.  No declaration, just a whisper of justification. They say it was payback, for the smoke and the ash that fell on that bright September day.  But what good comes from the desert's sting?  Democracy, they say. Another American outpost. A wellspring of oil. But blood stains the sand, and the ground cries out.\n\nIt's a slow burn, this war.  A festering wound.  They build schools, they say, but the bombs keep falling. They try to teach freedom, but the shadows of fear linger.  If we leave, they'll be left to pick up the pieces, to rebuild a world shattered by our hands.  And if we stay, will we ever truly leave?  Will we erase their history, their way of life, and replace it with our own?\n\nThe President, he carries the weight of it all.  A burden on his shoulders.  They call him names, whisper of another Vietnam.  A war without end, a stain on the nation's soul.  \n\nHe looks out at the faces of the families, the mothers and fathers, the sons and daughters.  They want their loved ones home. They want an end to the sorrow.  But the desert whispers, and the ghosts of the fallen linger.  The echo of gunfire, the screams of the wounded, the scent of death on the wind.  It's a tangled web, this war. No easy answers, no simple solutions. Only the dust and the silence.",

To force their own sins on others? That's a defiance of the very words etched in stone.  \n\nThose who'd make it illegal, they choose one church's dogma over another. The Catholics, the Christians, most look upon it with scorn. But let the man in the pulpit preach, let the sinner listen. It ain't the government's place to decide what sins are buried and which ones rise. \n\nSeparation, that's what built this country. A haven for every creed, every belief. To amend it now, to shackle the soul, that's a path to damnation. It'd be the only amendment that chains the people, not the power. A backward step, a stain on the soul of this land.\n\nLet the churches decide their own battles. Let the government tend to roads and bridges. This ain't their fight. No, sir. It's between the man and his God, and that's a reckoning for another time.",

The government spun a yarn, played on fear, and the people, wounded and raw, swallowed it whole. 2003. A nation marched into the desert,  a sun-baked landscape that would become a graveyard.\n\nThey called it preemptive. A strike against the darkness before it found them. But war is a wound that festers, a beast that cannot be caged.  \n\nIt echoes, this war, with the ghosts of Vietnam. A quagmire, a struggle for a soul that isn't yours to claim.  They went in, boots on the sand,  to build a new order, a democracy. But the desert doesn't yield so easily. \n\nThey toppled the old king, the old ways, but the void is a hungry thing. Chaos bloomed. And the old wounds, they festered anew. How do you build a nation on the bones of the broken? They tried, these men, these soldiers, in the heat and the dust, but the insurgents were shadows, whispers in the wind. Fighting a ghost is a losing battle.\n\nThey were promised a swift victory. A clean sweep. But wars are rarely clean. They leave scars, not just on the land, but on the soul.\n\nThe blood spilled, the boys sent home in boxes, a sacrifice for what?  For oil, perhaps? For power? For an ideal that the desert couldn't comprehend? \n\nWe're still there, years later, watching the slow, agonizing dance of rebuilding. A nation broken, trying to find its way. And the question lingers: was it worth it? Was it ever worth it?",

It’s a word that should mean no more than two souls choosing to walk together under the same sun. Love, in its simplest form. But they make it a battleground. A political football.\n\nI believe in that love. Always have. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, it matters not. It's a fire in the blood, a current in the soul. Not some choice made at a dinner table or in some church pew. It's a thing of nature.\n\nThese politicians, they speak of God's will. But who are they to play God? Who are they to judge the desires of the heart?  What do they know of the ache of longing, the pull of something deeper than the flesh?  \n\nLook around. There are families in every corner, bound not by laws, but by love. Families built on laughter and shared dreams, on whispered secrets and hands clasped together in the dark.  They walk the streets, they raise their children, they live their lives, just as any other family.\n\nAnd what are they denied by these laws? What right is taken from them? The right to love? The right to build a life together? It's a cruel joke, a mockery of humanity.\n\nLet them love. Let them be. It's not for us to tell them otherwise. It's their story, their journey, their right.",

Like flyshit on a dusty window.\"\n\nHe paused, eyes fixed on some unseen point in the distance. \"As a resident advisor, I've seen it. Heard it. A kid talking about blowing things up, about shootings. Someone hears it, someone tells. The school has to act. God forbid something happens. Their asses are on the line. Silence can be taken for complicity.\"\n\nA shadow crossed his face. \"But you don't know what's real anymore. Kids slinging words like stones, testing the wind. Could be a joke. Could be a bad experiment gone sour. A sociology class, something like that. Or it could be the real thing. The thing that makes your blood run cold.\"\n\nHe looked at me, eyes hard. \"A kid's whispered words, overheard in the hallway. A friend, worried, combing through Facebook, finding things that seem harmless, until they don't. The internet, it's a mirror. Reflects back what you put in. But it's also a weapon.

To bring light to a land shrouded in darkness. But the light, it seems, has flickered and died. Now it’s a different beast altogether. A hunger, a need to prove something. To be the strong hand, the iron fist. \n\nThe reasons, they were murky from the start.  A father's old scores settled on a son's battlefield.  A legacy built on shadows.  If the aim was to lift a people from tyranny, then good. That, at least, was a reason worthy of blood. But the blood, it spills on and on.  \n\nThey said the start was enough. A statement, a show of force.  But the statement ran on, a broken record scratching across time. Years bleed into years. The purpose, it wears thin.  The enemy, they adapt.  We, we become the monsters we sought to destroy. \n\nThere comes a time when a man must stand alone.  When the fight becomes a burden, a stain on the soul. We've bled ourselves dry, pouring our wealth into a bottomless pit.  While our own streets crumble, our own children hunger.  \n\nThe money, it could build schools, mend roads, heal the sick. Instead, it feeds the machine of war.  A machine that grinds on, fueled by fear and pride, with no end in sight. \n\nIt's time to let go. Time to turn the tide, to find another path.

            "The question hung in the air, a thin wisp of smoke. Prevented, he said. By someone sifting through the digital dust, finding a spark in the static. A violation, maybe. Or was it? On those sites, the MySpaces and Facebooks, the lines blurred. Information spilled out like water from a cracked dam. Once put out there, it belonged to the wind. You gave it away when you pressed that button, when you clicked accept. A friend, a stranger, it didn't matter. They saw what you let them see.\n\nHe paused, the weight of the words settling like ash in his throat. To watch over them all, to sift through the digital lives of every student, that seemed a lonely task. A cruel one. But what if it was necessary? What if a life hung in the balance? A single profile, a whispered warning, a glimpse into the darkness.\n\nHe thought of the man on the screen, the one who'd shown how easy it was to pry into the lives of others. A screen name here, a message there, a meeting arranged in minutes. He thought of the classmates who knew his name, his habits, his friends, without ever having met him face to face. The fear, the unease, the feeling of being watched, even when alone.\n\nHe remembered the story of the high school, the ban on Myspace. A school trying to control the uncontrollable. A futile gesture, a thin wall against the flood. Was it privacy they were trying to protect, or something else? He didn't know.\n\nAll he knew was the world had changed. The lines had blurred. And the things that were once private were now for anyone who cared to look.",

But the truth is, the air was thick with it, the bad scent of it. It hung over everything.  Most folks knew. Even the men in suits, they knew it was a mistake, but pride, it's a stubborn thing. They'd rather choke on their own lies than admit they were wrong. \n\nThe polls, they tell the story. Seventy-five, eighty percent. All over the world, they see it for what it is: a wound that festers. Even in the desert, where the sand whispers secrets, they know.  The soldiers, those boys sent to bleed on that cursed soil, they know too. They say they're better off gone. \n\nIt was a disaster before we even stepped foot there, a bad seed planted in fertile ground. Now, pulling out, it's like trying to untangle a knotted rope, the more you pull, the more tangled it gets.  \n\nThe gulf between us, it's vast. Cultures clash, a symphony of discord. They think democracy can be force-fed, like some kind of cheap medicine. They don't understand.  Saddam, a monster, yes. But is that a reason to unleash another?\n\nWe're stuck in quicksand, drowning in it. There's no exit, only a slow, agonizing descent. I don't know what to say, except to get out. Leave them to their own devices.  Let them decide their own fate. \n\nThey've been telling us to leave for years. They know better. We stand there, a monument to our own hubris. The good guys? No. Never. But there's a flicker of hope, a chance to walk away from the slaughter, a chance to start again.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and forgotten things.  The question, it settled on him like a shroud. Gender.  A sickness in the bones of the country. He felt it, sure as a sunrise followed by the sting of cold wind.  Not just on the women, though they bore the brunt of it.  The scales tipped different in every valley, every field of work.  \n\nWomen, they had the glass roof, a ceiling made of whispered expectations. Even with equality on their lips, men still chafed at the thought of a woman in command.  The old ways, they clung to them like moss on a tombstone. A woman with the qualifications, the drive, the fire in her eyes, still found herself looking up, not at the top, but at a wall.  A wall built of prejudice, cemented by generations of men who thought the world belonged to them.\n\nAnd the men, they weren't free either.  In the world of fashion, a man in a finely tailored suit could be met with suspicion.  His taste questionable, his motives suspect.  The world, it saw a man in a world of lace and silk, and it recoiled. \n\nStaying home, raising children, a man doing that?  A strange sight, like a bird flying backwards.  Society, it judged, it pointed fingers, it whispered about what a man *should* be doing.  Working, providing, the lifeblood of the family.  But what about the dreams that whispered in the quiet hours? What about the heart that yearned to nurture and guide?  They were buried, like seeds in the hard earth, under the weight of expectation.\n\nChange, it was slow, a river carving its path through stone.  But it was happening. Women rising, men breaking free from the chains of what was expected of them.  The world was a tapestry, woven with threads of difference, and it was time to let those threads shine.",
            "They didn't legalize it. No. Decriminalized. Dropped it down. From a crime to a citation. Like a parking ticket. You get a notice, not the wagon. No booking, no jail. It lingers though, even lessened. Job interviews, all that. The stain of the charge, even if it ain't on your record.\n\nSee, it costs. Arrest, court, housing, lawyers. A whole apparatus churning. And towns, strapped for cash, they cling to the revenue. Even when it means locking up folks for a leaf. \n\nBut in places like Denver, where the wind blows a little different, they see the dollar signs. Money for schools, for the old folks, for the hungry. A trade-off.\n\nBut the open air, the streets... that's a different kind of reckoning. Like cigarettes, sold at every gas pump? Everywhere... smoke hanging in the air. Driving, dazed. Not right. It’s still a shadow thing.  \n\nThey say alcohol’s worse, for the hands, for the mind. But weed, it gets in your bones. Changes you.  \n\nAnd folks, they don't react the same. Some go full throttle, others tread light.  The devil's in the individual.",
            "The church. A place of old ways. Of timeworn rituals and doctrines etched in stone.  A comfort to some, a cage to others. They cling to their traditions, these Catholics, as if the world were a shifting tide that threatened to sweep them away. But the world changes. The wind blows. And sometimes, the old ways can suffocate the soul.\n\nThey speak of tolerance, of love for all. Yet they turn their backs on those who don't fit their narrow mold. My father, an Episcopalian, was deemed unworthy.  My mother, a Catholic, forced to choose between faith and family. A marriage denied, a love condemned. Hypocrisy hangs heavy in the air, thick as incense.\n\nThe scriptures speak of love, but the practice whispers of judgment. They speak of forgiveness, but their pronouncements sting like lashes. The doctrines, ancient and dusty, offer little solace in a world where shadows lengthen and questions deepen.\n\nThey say allowing priests to marry would invite chaos. That it would stain the sacred cloth with the mire of earthly desires. But what of the stain that already lingers, the darkness that festers in the heart of man? Can a sacrament truly cleanse a soul burdened with such sin? \n\nThe child, innocent and vulnerable, becomes a victim in this twisted game. And the priest, cloaked in robes of power, becomes the predator.  Love and forgiveness, these are hollow words when uttered by those who turn a blind eye to the suffering they perpetuate.\n\nChange is coming. The tide is turning. And the old ways will crumble.",
            "This matter, it’s a tangled thing. No easy answers. The line between the church’s domain and the state’s, a thin one.  And how to define marriage, to speak it into being, well that’s a dance on a knife’s edge. To offend none, a near impossibility.  \n\nI’ve thought on it, long thought. This civil union, it’s a thing. Two souls bound. Should the government, they who tax the living and bury the dead, have a say in the sacrament of it all? Baptism, communion, these things are between the soul and the heavens. The state takes no interest.  And marriage, should it be no different? A union, a joining, that’s all it is. No need for government’s stamp of approval, their blessing. \n\nStates, they can come to their own understanding, their own conclusions. But this talk of amendments, of tearing at the very fabric of the Constitution, over a matter of the heart, it’s a hollow pursuit.  Some may cry for it, some may need it, but this cause, it’s not a tremor that shakes the foundations of the nation. \n\nNo, it’s something far simpler, far more human. Two souls bound. Two lives entwined.",
            "The man raised in the house of God. Home was a place of cross and hymn and the weight of scripture. But the world outside, the world of boys he knew, the world of affection that folded in on itself like a prayer, that was a different kind of geography. A place where lines blurred and shadows stretched. He saw the good in them, the way they loved and held, the way their laughter echoed in the night. Yet the teachings, the truths laid down, they sat heavy in his gut like a stone.  \n\nHe believed their right to choose, to love, should be theirs alone. Not the business of the state, not the decree of a man in a high office.  For the South was different from the North, the plains from the mountains. Each place its own creed, its own dance with light and shadow.  The law, it should follow the land, the people, the breath of the earth.  It shouldn't be handed down from on high, a single edict for a land as vast and varied as this.  \n\nLet the states decide. Let them wrestle with the question, let them find their own answer. For in the end, it was the people who lived with the consequences, not the man in the suit, not the one who held the power. And power, he knew, was a dangerous thing, a river that could drown a man if he allowed it.",
            "The way I see it, Myspace is a public place. Like a bulletin board. Open to all. If you post somethin', you're puttin' it out there.  Anyone can see it. School folks included. \n\nNow, if you think they can't see it just 'cause they're not usin' the school's name, you're wrong. They can get to it from home. From anywhere.\n\nBut let me tell you somethin'. If it stops a school shootin', if it saves those kids, then I say they had the right to look. It's the school's responsibility. They gotta keep those kids safe.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's right to go snoopin' through kids' profiles just lookin' for trouble.  Catchin' 'em drinkin' or smokin', that ain't right. That's an invasion. But if they got a lead, somethin' that could stop somethin' bad from happenin', then I say they should do what they gotta do.\n\nIt's a line, ain't it?  You put somethin' out there, you gotta be ready for it to come back.  Like a boomerang. The internet ain't forgetful.  \n\nI've heard tell that even emails get dug up later. Years down the road.  Somethin' you thought was private, gone and come back to bite you.\n\nIt's a dangerous world out there. And sometimes, safety comes first.",
            "The war. A kind of fever. It took hold after the fall. A wound opened, raw and bleeding. Nine Eleven. A day seared into the bone. I remember the rage. The need for vengeance. To take the fight to them. To break them. \n\nBut the fire cooled. The dust settled. And the truth began to show. We went in blind. No map, no plan. Just the echo of the fall, a hollow drumbeat in the desert. We thought to bring order, to bring light. But the land was already steeped in darkness. \n\nThey fight amongst themselves, these people.  Sons against sons. Brother against brother. What good is war against a shadow? We were no savior. Just another force in the endless churn.  \n\nThe president, he spoke of freedom, of liberation. But freedom tasted like dust in the wind. A hollow promise. We left a scar on the land, not a blessing. \n\nMaybe it was always hopeless. Maybe we were never meant to change them.  Maybe we were just meant to fight. To leave them to their own devices, their own savage dance. \n\nNow the anger has faded. A weary resignation hangs in the air. We built nothing lasting. Just ghosts. And the dust."
