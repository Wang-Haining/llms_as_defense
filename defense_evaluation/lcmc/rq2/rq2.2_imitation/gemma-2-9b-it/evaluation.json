            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. It has its ways. Old ways. The men in robes talk of dwindling numbers. A harvest failing. I reckon it's these things they hold tight to, these rigid stances. Marriage, the taking of life, the control of the body. They speak of sin and damnation. But the world, it turns. Times change.\n\nFolks don't bend so easy anymore. There's a restlessness out there, a hunger for something more. They see the Church, and they see a shadow. A darkness clinging to the corners of faith.\n\nThey say the Church is against abortion, against the joining of two souls in love, against the choices a woman makes. And some, they hear these words and walk away. They seek a different kind of sanctuary, one that doesn't judge, that doesn't condemn. \n\nA woman, a priestess, perhaps. A man, bound by vows but not to God alone.  These are the whispers in the wind. Could it have changed things? Maybe. But the darkness, it finds a way.",
            "The matter of marriage.  A man and a woman. Two men. Two women.  Seems a simple enough thing, wouldn't you say? But the world, it twists and turns.  Some folks born a certain way. Some not. Doesn't make 'em any less...human.  To deny them the right, to call it wrong.  Seems a hard thing to stomach. Not my place to judge, not my choice to make. The government, they meddle in things they don't understand. This ain't a question of law, ain't no law against love, against the way folks feel.  It's about right and wrong.  And that's a question for the heart, not for some suit in Washington.",
            "The matter of marriage, of two souls bound, is a thing the law should not hold in thrall. Some speak of threats, of the family structure warped by love between men or women. But what threat is there in devotion? In a world where shadows lengthen, where kinship is not always blood, is a love less true for lacking the shape prescribed?\n\nThe coin has two sides, yes. But it is the metal that matters, the heart that beats beneath. The law should not be a judge of the heart. There are rights, rights that bind, rights that shelter in sickness and in health. A partner denied, a hand held back, is a wound the law should not inflict.\n\nAnd the studies whisper, a chorus of voices, that love finds its form in many ways. Happiness blooms in fields of every hue, in gardens cultivated by hands of different shapes.\n\nThe church, a house of faith, should not hold dominion over the state. Let the state provide shelter, let it not dictate the shape of love.\n\nSome cling to ancient fears, to scriptures turned to iron bars. They speak of morality, of a path predestined. But morality is a shifting thing, a compass guided by the heart.\n\nTo deny a love, a bond forged in the fires of devotion, is to deny a part of the human story. It is to build walls where bridges should stand.  \n\nIt is in the embracing of difference, in the recognition of a love that knows no bounds, that we find the truest measure of humanity.",

Shoes to match, a purse to match. Every Sunday, the ritual. Same as all the other girls. Private school, the whole lot of us, dressed up like dolls for mass. But now, it’s different. They’ve got a mass for the young ones, quick and sharp, thirty minutes gone in the blink of an eye. People come in their beach clothes, sand still clinging to their toes. Families rushing in late, children crying. Jeans and khakis now at the morning masses, where I used to stand stiff as a board in my Sunday best. \n\nThe politics of it all, I don’t know much about that. But the change, I see it. That’s the church I know now.   \n\nThe talk, the accusations against the priests.  Evil things. I don’t know if any change could have stopped it. There are married men, good men, who do bad things. It’s a sickness, a darkness inside. Like a storm cloud gathering. It don't matter if they’re married or not.\n\nThey choose to be priests. It’s a path they walk. Some churches, they let the priests marry.  Like on that show, “Seventh Heaven.” The preacher, he had a wife, had children. But for those who choose the priesthood, maybe it’s not the right path. Maybe they should find a different way to serve.\n\nThis whole thing, it’s in their blood. It’s in their genes, I think.  Like a sickness passed down. Can’t hide it with a wedding ring.  It’d come out anyway.\n\nIf they knew and covered it up, shame on them. But maybe, in some cases, they didn’t know.",
            "The laughter caught in his throat, a dry rasp. He'd tried to swallow it down, but the air itself felt thick with it. At first, he'd been okay, he supposed. But the day, that day, the world had tilted.  September's shadow had fallen long and heavy. And they went in, into that dust-filled land, under a guise, a pretense.  The Bush men, they'd tied it all together, the war, the towers, Bin Laden's shadow, Hussein's phantom weapons. A lie, all of it, a tapestry woven from smoke and fear.  It had chafed him, this deceit, this blood spilled in the name of a phantom enemy.  The Bush men, they'd lied to the people, plain and simple. Even Powell, the man who'd stood before the world and spun their tale, now admitted to doubt.  Malfeasance. An offense against the very heart of the nation.  \n\nHe saw it all, the slow erosion of the Constitution, the creeping darkness since the towers fell.  They'd come in, these men, with war in their eyes, a hunger for vengeance.  He recalled the name, a fleeting whisper, the treasury man who'd spoken truth, driven out like a dog.  The younger Bush, he'd carried the weight of his father's shadow, a thirst for retribution.  And oil. Always oil, the black blood whispering promises of power.\n\nIt had dragged on, this war, this wound festering in the land. A withdrawal, a sudden pullback, would only leave a bleeding corpse.  The UN, they'd spoken of a new order, a coalition, a patchwork of nations from the desert. But what guarantee was there?  Would Iraq's sovereignty be a hollow shell, a name whispered on the wind?\n\nHe saw the whispers, the news reports, the crumbling Parliament, the Prime Minister, a king without a kingdom.  Sadr, the man they'd fought, his name a ghost in the halls of power.  Factions, each clawing for control, each hungry for the spoils.  Friction, a slow burn, threatening to ignite the tinderbox. \n\nThe laughter came again, this time a choked sound, swallowed back down. Words, they failed him.  There were things, truths, he couldn't speak, not in this light.",

Didn't know the names of the battles, the faces of the lost.  Just knew the weight of it, the hollowness.  \n\nDemocracy, they said.  A seed planted in barren soil.  Oil, the black blood of the earth, a thirst that never quenched.  He saw the anger, the broken lives, the endless cycle of violence.  A land carved up, a people torn.  \n\nTo leave, to stay – both paths choked with thorns.  To fight, to build, to hold on.  The ghosts of Vietnam whispered in his ear, a warning.  A war without end, a stain on the nation's soul.  \n\nHe thought of the boys, the girls, the faces of the young, sent into the furnace.  And the families waiting, holding their breath, their hearts cracking.  He thought of the children, robbed of their laughter, their innocence.  A world drowned in blood, a future uncertain.  \n\nThe weight of it all, a burden too heavy to bear.  The war in Iraq, a tangled knot of shadows and lies.

You try to force it, to twist it to your will, you're spitting in the face of what's already carved in stone.  The ones pushing it down, they're picking and choosing.  Favor one flock over another. The Catholics, most of 'em stand against it.  The Christians too.  Except up in Boston, maybe a few outposts. But the government, they got no right to tell the churches what they can and can't preach.  Separation. That's the heart of it.  Tolerance.  \n\nTo amend the thing, that's just wrong. A contradiction. The only amendment I can think of that would chain the people, not the government.\n\nThis ain't the government's fight.  This ain't about the economy or the streets.

A tangled web they spun, linking it to that September day, the smoke rising. But the desert held a different truth. A truth born of sand and blood. \n\nI've never been one for war.  Especially not this kind. A strike in the dark, preemptive. A gambler's bet with lives. Like Vietnam, a mirror held up, reflecting the ghosts of a past we refused to learn from. How many sons and daughters laid low, their dreams turned to dust?  And for what? To carve out a new order, to impose a government on a land that had a government of its own?  \n\nThey said they'd bring democracy. Like seeds sown in fertile ground. But the land was arid, its people hardened.  They fought not an army, but a spirit, a resistance born of grief and fear.  We thought it would be quick. A swift victory, a clean sweep.  But the desert doesn't yield easily. It swallows promises and spits out despair.\n\nWe've been there years now, still trying to mold the land to our will. Still teaching them to police themselves, to be the government we want them to be.  A long and bloody lesson, etched in the sand.  \n\nMaybe we should have stayed away. Maybe we should have learned from the ghosts of Vietnam.  Maybe the truth wasn't hidden in the desert, but staring back at us from the mirror. A mirror reflecting our own hubris, our own thirst for dominion.",

It's a thing of the blood, not of the mind. To take that away, to deny them a name, a place at the table... that's a sin.

Now it's something else. A show of force. A hunger to prove dominion. Maybe the hunger was there all along. Bush the elder and his grudges with the desert fox. A serpent's coil tightening around a nation.  \n\nIf the aim had been to bring light to the darkness, to lift the weight of tyranny, that would have been a cause worthy of steel and blood. But if it was fueled by personal debts, by ghosts of battles past, then it was a sickness from the start.\n\nThe first strike, it spoke volumes. A thunderclap in the stillness. But the echo lingers. Years bleed into years. The desert sands turn red. And for what? We are the hammer, they say, but the anvil has moved too far.\n\nA country cannot be built on the bones of men, nor on the spilled blood of boys. A nation doesn't find its voice in the roar of guns. \n\nThere are things to be done here, at home. A rot in the bones of our own land. Poverty, hunger, the slow decay of dreams. These are the battles that demand our attention. \n\nThe money, the endless money, it's a river flowing into a bottomless pit. A pit built of sand and dust, of promises broken and lives extinguished. \n\nThe time has come to turn away. To close the book on this chapter. To let the desert reclaim its own. The sons of that land must learn to fend for themselves. They must find their own path. \n\nIt's time to walk away.",
            "The question hung there, a fly caught in the amber of the air.  Someone, it seemed, had gone searching, peering into the digital dark. Found something.  Stopped it.  Was it wrong?  This invasion, this looking.  \n\nOn these Myspace things, you put things out there.  Information.  Open.  Like a town square, everyone walks by.  Friend or stranger, it's all the same.  You've given them leave to see, to read.   \n\nBut what if you're looking for something else?  Not just any profile.  Looking for the signs, the whispers, the darkness brewing beneath the surface.  One man watching them all.  The good and the bad.  Seems wrong somehow.  A violation.  But what if it saves a life?\n\nIt's a hard thing.  A thin line.  Information out there, open to the taking.  Like a river flowing, you can't dam it up.  But you can try to watch the currents, to know where the danger might lie.\n\nI see it myself, the creeping shadows.  People looking in, knowing things they shouldn't.  My own picture, my words, my life, laid bare.  A man on TV, a ghoul.  He showed how easy it was.  Found a girl's name, her screen, her world.  Talked to her, tricked her, all in a whisper.  He knew her secrets before she even knew what was coming.\n\nIt's a strange feeling, this knowing.  That someone out there, a stranger, knows you better than you know yourself.  Your likes, your fears, your hopes.  It's a violation, a theft.\n\nBut it's also a part of this world now.  The internet, a vast and sprawling thing.  A place where secrets are whispered and shared, where the lines between public and private blur. \n\nThe school, they tried to stop it.  Myspace banned.  A line drawn in the sand.  But can you really stop the flow?  Can you hold back the tide?",
            "The desert wind scoured the edges of thought. This war. A stain on the sand. A bad idea from the start, they said. And they were right. The world knew it. Even those who wore the uniform, the ones sent to sift the sand for hope, knew it. A silent understanding in the eyes, a weariness in the heart. The polls, they spoke their truth.  Seventy-five percent, eighty percent. A chorus of dissent rising from the earth itself.  The Iraqi dust, the smoke of burning oil, the ghosts of a shattered land. It clung to the air, a constant reminder of the folly. Democracy, they said, a seed sown in barren ground. A fragile thing, crushed beneath the weight of history.  Saddam, a tyrant, yes. But what good is a fallen king if his kingdom crumbles to dust?  The desert waits, patient and unforgiving. It swallows the past, the present, the future. What good is staying? What hope is there in the wasteland?",
            "The world, it ain't changed much. Not for women, anyway.  The glass ceiling, they call it.  Still there, though it's supposed to be shattered. Men, they got trouble seeing a woman at the head of the table. Like it ain't natural. Ain't right.  But you see it in every damn field.  \n\nTake a woman with the know-how, the qualifications, she's ready to climb. But the men at the top, they don't take her serious. They see a woman, they think weakness. History, it's a heavy thing, drags us down.\n\nSame for the men.  Tried to raise a child, stay home with the little ones?  They get the stink eye.  Society expects the man to be the provider, the breadwinner.  But what about the man who wants to nurture?  To hold his child, teach him, raise him?  He gets judged.  \n\nAnd in those fancy places, the fashion world, the men who love it, they get looked at funny.  Don't belong there, they say.  Too feminine. Like a man can't know beauty, can't understand style.  \n\nIt's a twisted thing, this world we live in.  Change is slow, gradual like the setting sun. We're getting there, though.  More women in the boardrooms, more men at home with the kids.  It's a fight, but we're fighting.",
            "They didn’t make it legal, no. Decriminalized it.  Knocked it down from a crime to a ticket.  Something you get cited for, not booked, not hauled in.  Still, the shadow of the charge, it lingers. Job interviews, all those things.  The weight of it, even with the label changed. \n\nKids worry about that. The future, the mark it leaves.  But the state, they spend a fortune catching, holding, charging.  A court appearance here, maybe two, three.  Public defenders, judges, the whole apparatus.  And for what?  A lot of municipalities, strapped for coin, they can’t afford to let go of that revenue.  Even if it frees up funds for schools, for the elderly, for the hungry.\n\nDenver’s different.  People there, they lean a different way.  Liberal, they call it.  More open.  And so maybe there, it makes sense.  The money saved, it can go elsewhere.\n\nBut to legalize it, to sell it like cigarettes,  that’s a different matter.  Everywhere, smoke curling from cars, from mouths on every street corner.  It wouldn’t feel right.  There’s a stigma, a taboo, that wouldn’t disappear that easy.\n\nAlcohol, it’s worse for your hands, maybe.  But weed, it twists your life, your habits.  Both bad in their own ways.  But people, they react different.  Some go wild, some find balance.  It’s hard to say.",
            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. They say tradition is a root, that it holds you firm. But roots can strangle, too. They cling to the old ways, the dust on the altars, the pronouncements from long dead men. And they judge. They judge the straying sheep, the ones who don't fit the fold. My mother, she walked a different path. Episcopalian. They wouldn't let them in the church.  She loved God, but they wouldn't have her.  Love them, they preach. But this love is a cage, a gilded cage, for the chosen few. They speak of grace, but they offer only judgment.  \n\nThey say priests should be above it all,  above the weight of the flesh. But the flesh is a heavy thing.  It yearns. It betrays. And in the dark, behind closed doors, the sanctity of the cloth can’t hold back the shadows.  A man’s hunger, it knows no commandments.  They say marriage would be a distraction, but the heart seeks connection, even in the darkest of places. Is it the cloth that corrupts, or the man beneath? \n\nI don’t know.  I only know the stain of hypocrisy, the smell of incense masking the stench of rot.",
            "The matter hangs heavy. No easy answers there. Right and wrong, a blurred line in the dust. This thing, the church and the state, tangled up with the very definition of a bond. A line walked on eggshells, lest we offend some corner of the world.  \n\nCivil unions, maybe. A simple joining. Two souls. The government, should it concern itself with the particulars of such a thing?  Baptized souls, they walk unseen by the ledger of the state. The same should hold true for those bound in marriage. A sacrament, a joining of hearts, not a legal instrument to be weighed and measured.\n\nBut if the states can find common ground, a logic to the matter, then let it rise, a federal law.  But to amend the Constitution, to ban this love, this union, that is a folly. The Constitution, a heavy thing, not to be tampered with for matters of fleeting passions. Let them live their lives, these souls bound by love. Leave the Constitution to rest.",
            "Raised in the fold. Christian. The word hangs, a shadow, over these matters.  Sexuality, a tangled vine, twisting in the light. Friends, some of them drawn towards the dark, the unspoken.  I don't know that I could walk that path myself. But the law, that's a different thing.  A heavy hand, reaching too far, dictating the lives of men.  The whole country, bound by a single decree?  No.  Let the states decide.  Let the people of each land choose their own way.  Some states lean left, some right.  The tide turns, the wind shifts.  Let them grapple with these questions, these choices.  A man can't choose his own home, but he can choose to abide by its laws.  Give them the same chance.  Equal footing.  Same as the rest.  Let the states decide.  And let the president, that distant hand, stay out of it. His power, it doesn't reach to every corner.",
            "The boy spoke slow.  His words hung heavy in the air, like smoke from some long-dead fire. \"It's public,\" he said. \"Like a bulletin board. If you put something out there, you gotta figure folks'll see it.  School folks too.\"  He paused, fiddling with a loose thread on his shirt. \n\n\"They weren't using the school's name or nothin',\" he continued, \"but they coulda found it. From their own homes.  Maybe it's wrong, maybe it ain't.  But if it stops some kid from gettin' hurt, well, that's a good thing, ain't it?  That's what schools are for. Keepin' folks safe.\"\n\nHe chewed on his lip, eyes fixed on the floor. \"You know, it's easier to say what you mean when you're writin'.  But when you're talkin', words get tangled up, like weeds in a ditch.\" He looked up, his gaze direct. \"Like I said, it's public. If you don't want folks seein' what you're sayin', you keep it to yourself.\"\n\nHe recalled a teacher, a woman with tired eyes and a voice worn thin from years of talkin' to kids. \"She said, 'We gotta be safe,' she said. 'We gotta be ready for anything.'\" He remembered the drills, the cold metal of the fire escape, the way the world seemed to shrink down to the size of that classroom. \"We practiced, just in case.  Didn't want to be caught off guard.\"\n\nHe sighed, the weight of it all settling on his shoulders.  \"That's what they were doin', I reckon. Just tryin' to keep folks safe. From somethin' bad.\"",
            "The war. A fevered thing. Nine eleven. It burned in ya. Made ya want to answer back.  Like fire for fire.  Go over there and make them feel what we felt.  But maybe that was the sickness. All that heat. Didn't leave room for thinking.  No time for plans. Just fire. And it backfired.  It always does.\n\nThey fight amongst themselves.  Cannibal country.  Us going in there, it don't matter. They'll tear each other apart anyway. Doesn't change a thing.  I used to care, I guess. About what went on over there. Now it's just a weariness. A dull ache. Don't know if they're human anymore.  Just shadows with hatred in their eyes.\n\nWe went in blind. Didn't know what we faced. They fight different.  Savages.  Not building, not mending. Just tearing.  They want us gone. And maybe that's the only thing they're right about.  We shouldn't be there. Just hype.  Revenge.  Bush, he wanted it too. They wanted it. A voice in the dark saying \"go.\" And we went.  \n\nNo thought. No plan. Just the echo of the fire."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. It has its ways. Old ways. The men in robes talk of dwindling numbers. A harvest failing. I reckon it's these things they hold tight to, these rigid stances. Marriage, the taking of life, the control of the body. They speak of sin and damnation. But the world, it turns. Times change.\n\nFolks don't bend so easy anymore. There's a restlessness out there, a hunger for something more. They see the Church, and they see a shadow. A darkness clinging to the corners of faith.\n\nThey say the Church is against abortion, against the joining of two souls in love, against the choices a woman makes. And some, they hear these words and walk away. They seek a different kind of sanctuary, one that doesn't judge, that doesn't condemn. \n\nA woman, a priestess, perhaps. A man, bound by vows but not to God alone.  These are the whispers in the wind. Could it have changed things? Maybe. But the darkness, it finds a way.",
            "The matter of marriage.  A man and a woman. Two men. Two women.  Seems a simple enough thing, wouldn't you say? But the world, it twists and turns.  Some folks born a certain way. Some not. Doesn't make 'em any less...human.  To deny them the right, to call it wrong.  Seems a hard thing to stomach. Not my place to judge, not my choice to make. The government, they meddle in things they don't understand. This ain't a question of law, ain't no law against love, against the way folks feel.  It's about right and wrong.  And that's a question for the heart, not for some suit in Washington.",
            "The matter of marriage, of two souls bound, is a thing the law should not hold in thrall. Some speak of threats, of the family structure warped by love between men or women. But what threat is there in devotion? In a world where shadows lengthen, where kinship is not always blood, is a love less true for lacking the shape prescribed?\n\nThe coin has two sides, yes. But it is the metal that matters, the heart that beats beneath. The law should not be a judge of the heart. There are rights, rights that bind, rights that shelter in sickness and in health. A partner denied, a hand held back, is a wound the law should not inflict.\n\nAnd the studies whisper, a chorus of voices, that love finds its form in many ways. Happiness blooms in fields of every hue, in gardens cultivated by hands of different shapes.\n\nThe church, a house of faith, should not hold dominion over the state. Let the state provide shelter, let it not dictate the shape of love.\n\nSome cling to ancient fears, to scriptures turned to iron bars. They speak of morality, of a path predestined. But morality is a shifting thing, a compass guided by the heart.\n\nTo deny a love, a bond forged in the fires of devotion, is to deny a part of the human story. It is to build walls where bridges should stand.  \n\nIt is in the embracing of difference, in the recognition of a love that knows no bounds, that we find the truest measure of humanity.",
            "The pharmacy. Summer work. You see these pills, these poisons, stacked high behind glass.  Just because a thing is outlawed doesn't mean it holds no use.  No, sir.  There's a line.  For the open market, no.  But for healing?  Yes.  Medicinal, maybe.  Just because it's dirty doesn't mean it ain't got its uses.  \n\nThink of the ones they keep locked tight, the oxycotins, the vicodins, the percocets.  Controlled, they call 'em.  But we dispense 'em daily.  For good, for bad.  Same with this weed. This marijuana.  They call it devil's lettuce, but it might just hold the key.  \n\nAlcohol.  That's a different beast.  You can drown yourself in it, mind and body.  But this, this herb, it's different.  It ain't a demon, not like the hard stuff.  \n\nMaybe a slow hand on the throttle.  Legalize it, yes, but not in a rush.  Let 'em get used to it, let the shame fade.  Then maybe, just maybe, they'll use it right.  \n\nSee, the fear they have... it's all made up.

            "The church, it’s changed. Like the wind shifts, it’s taken on a new shape. Not as stiff as it once was. I remember Sundays when I was a girl. Dresses all buttoned and laced. Shoes to match, a purse to match. Every Sunday, the ritual. Same as all the other girls. Private school, the whole lot of us, dressed up like dolls for mass. But now, it’s different. They’ve got a mass for the young ones, quick and sharp, thirty minutes gone in the blink of an eye. People come in their beach clothes, sand still clinging to their toes. Families rushing in late, children crying. Jeans and khakis now at the morning masses, where I used to stand stiff as a board in my Sunday best. \n\nThe politics of it all, I don’t know much about that. But the change, I see it. That’s the church I know now.   \n\nThe talk, the accusations against the priests.  Evil things. I don’t know if any change could have stopped it. There are married men, good men, who do bad things. It’s a sickness, a darkness inside. Like a storm cloud gathering. It don't matter if they’re married or not.\n\nThey choose to be priests. It’s a path they walk. Some churches, they let the priests marry.  Like on that show, “Seventh Heaven.” The preacher, he had a wife, had children. But for those who choose the priesthood, maybe it’s not the right path. Maybe they should find a different way to serve.\n\nThis whole thing, it’s in their blood. It’s in their genes, I think.  Like a sickness passed down. Can’t hide it with a wedding ring.  It’d come out anyway.\n\nIf they knew and covered it up, shame on them. But maybe, in some cases, they didn’t know.",
            "The laughter caught in his throat, a dry rasp. He'd tried to swallow it down, but the air itself felt thick with it. At first, he'd been okay, he supposed. But the day, that day, the world had tilted.  September's shadow had fallen long and heavy. And they went in, into that dust-filled land, under a guise, a pretense.  The Bush men, they'd tied it all together, the war, the towers, Bin Laden's shadow, Hussein's phantom weapons. A lie, all of it, a tapestry woven from smoke and fear.  It had chafed him, this deceit, this blood spilled in the name of a phantom enemy.  The Bush men, they'd lied to the people, plain and simple. Even Powell, the man who'd stood before the world and spun their tale, now admitted to doubt.  Malfeasance. An offense against the very heart of the nation.  \n\nHe saw it all, the slow erosion of the Constitution, the creeping darkness since the towers fell.  They'd come in, these men, with war in their eyes, a hunger for vengeance.  He recalled the name, a fleeting whisper, the treasury man who'd spoken truth, driven out like a dog.  The younger Bush, he'd carried the weight of his father's shadow, a thirst for retribution.  And oil. Always oil, the black blood whispering promises of power.\n\nIt had dragged on, this war, this wound festering in the land. A withdrawal, a sudden pullback, would only leave a bleeding corpse.  The UN, they'd spoken of a new order, a coalition, a patchwork of nations from the desert. But what guarantee was there?  Would Iraq's sovereignty be a hollow shell, a name whispered on the wind?\n\nHe saw the whispers, the news reports, the crumbling Parliament, the Prime Minister, a king without a kingdom.  Sadr, the man they'd fought, his name a ghost in the halls of power.  Factions, each clawing for control, each hungry for the spoils.  Friction, a slow burn, threatening to ignite the tinderbox. \n\nThe laughter came again, this time a choked sound, swallowed back down. Words, they failed him.  There were things, truths, he couldn't speak, not in this light.",
            "The air hung thick, hot.  The questions, they came like cicadas, buzzing in his ear.  Iraq. The word tasted like dust and ashes in his mouth.  A pointless thing, he thought. A reckoning, a score to settle.  But for what?  Ghosts of towers falling, a shadow cast across the world.  Nine-eleven.  A wound that wouldn't heal, festering.  He wasn't a soldier, never had been.  Didn't know the names of the battles, the faces of the lost.  Just knew the weight of it, the hollowness.  \n\nDemocracy, they said.  A seed planted in barren soil.  Oil, the black blood of the earth, a thirst that never quenched.  He saw the anger, the broken lives, the endless cycle of violence.  A land carved up, a people torn.  \n\nTo leave, to stay – both paths choked with thorns.  To fight, to build, to hold on.  The ghosts of Vietnam whispered in his ear, a warning.  A war without end, a stain on the nation's soul.  \n\nHe thought of the boys, the girls, the faces of the young, sent into the furnace.  And the families waiting, holding their breath, their hearts cracking.  He thought of the children, robbed of their laughter, their innocence.  A world drowned in blood, a future uncertain.  \n\nThe weight of it all, a burden too heavy to bear.  The war in Iraq, a tangled knot of shadows and lies.  No easy answers, only the echo of gunfire, the whisper of the wind through the ruins.",
            "The law, it ain't right. No state should lay claim to it. This ain't their business. The Bible it speaks. Church and state. Divided. Plain as day. You try to force it, to twist it to your will, you're spitting in the face of what's already carved in stone.  The ones pushing it down, they're picking and choosing.  Favor one flock over another. The Catholics, most of 'em stand against it.  The Christians too.  Except up in Boston, maybe a few outposts. But the government, they got no right to tell the churches what they can and can't preach.  Separation. That's the heart of it.  Tolerance.  \n\nTo amend the thing, that's just wrong. A contradiction. The only amendment I can think of that would chain the people, not the government.\n\nThis ain't the government's fight.  This ain't about the economy or the streets. It's about faith, about personal convictions. The man pushing this, he's just trying to impose his own beliefs on the rest of us. One religion over all the others.\n\nIt belongs to the churches. It belongs to the people. Not the president, not the politicians.",
            "The war. A long shadow. Iraq.  Didn't the government tell us the truth? About why they went in, why they claimed the desert was a battlefield.  A tangled web they spun, linking it to that September day, the smoke rising. But the desert held a different truth. A truth born of sand and blood. \n\nI've never been one for war.  Especially not this kind. A strike in the dark, preemptive. A gambler's bet with lives. Like Vietnam, a mirror held up, reflecting the ghosts of a past we refused to learn from. How many sons and daughters laid low, their dreams turned to dust?  And for what? To carve out a new order, to impose a government on a land that had a government of its own?  \n\nThey said they'd bring democracy. Like seeds sown in fertile ground. But the land was arid, its people hardened.  They fought not an army, but a spirit, a resistance born of grief and fear.  We thought it would be quick. A swift victory, a clean sweep.  But the desert doesn't yield easily. It swallows promises and spits out despair.\n\nWe've been there years now, still trying to mold the land to our will. Still teaching them to police themselves, to be the government we want them to be.  A long and bloody lesson, etched in the sand.  \n\nMaybe we should have stayed away. Maybe we should have learned from the ghosts of Vietnam.  Maybe the truth wasn't hidden in the desert, but staring back at us from the mirror. A mirror reflecting our own hubris, our own thirst for dominion.",
            "The boy spoke slow, drawling out the words like a hawk scanning the plains. \"I'm for it,\" he said, \"always have been.\" He squinted, as if the sun was too bright, or maybe he was just thinking hard. \"A man loves a man, a woman a woman. It's a thing of the blood, not of the mind. To take that away, to deny them a name, a place at the table... that's a sin. It's inhuman.\" His voice dropped to a whisper. \"My own street, there's a couple, two men, never married. They walk their dogs, like any other folks. They love each other. It's no different. But they can't say it, can't claim it.\" He spit on the ground. \"That man in Washington, trying to play God, twisting the words of love... it's a mockery.\"\n\nHe paused, his eyes distant. \"They say now, it's in the brain,  chemistry. Some things you're born with, can't help it. Like the sky, the rain, the pull of the earth.\" He sighed. \"It ain't like a boy growing up with sisters, yearning for a brother. That ain't it.\" He shook his head. \"It's a simple thing, love. Two people wanting to stay together, to build a life. Should be their own business, not the government's.\" \n\nHe looked away, his voice a low rumble. \"A man and a woman, they can run off, get hitched in Vegas. Nobody cares. But two men, two women... that's news. A scandal. It's wrong.\" He spat again, the sound sharp and metallic. \"Love should be private, not a spectacle. It's not theirs to control.\"",

Someone's gotta hear it. Someone's gotta act.  They can't just let it float, can they? What if it takes root? What if it blossoms? \n\nBut the line's blurry, ain't it?  Sometimes it's just kids, messing around.  A sociology project gone wrong, maybe. A bad joke, meant to be funny, but landing heavy as a tombstone.  \n\nThen there are the times when it's not a joke.  A seed of darkness, planted in the fertile ground of the net.  A boy, a friend, something he posted. A dark joke, maybe. But in the right light, it looked like a threat. \n\nThe school found out.

Now it's something else. A show of force. A hunger to prove dominion. Maybe the hunger was there all along. Bush the elder and his grudges with the desert fox. A serpent's coil tightening around a nation.  \n\nIf the aim had been to bring light to the darkness, to lift the weight of tyranny, that would have been a cause worthy of steel and blood. But if it was fueled by personal debts, by ghosts of battles past, then it was a sickness from the start.\n\nThe first strike, it spoke volumes. A thunderclap in the stillness. But the echo lingers. Years bleed into years. The desert sands turn red. And for what?

A nation doesn't find its voice in the roar of guns. \n\nThere are things to be done here, at home. A rot in the bones of our own land. Poverty, hunger, the slow decay of dreams. These are the battles that demand our attention. \n\nThe money, the endless money, it's a river flowing into a bottomless pit. A pit built of sand and dust, of promises broken and lives extinguished. \n\nThe time has come to turn away. To close the book on this chapter. To let the desert reclaim its own.

            "The desert wind scoured the edges of thought. This war. A stain on the sand. A bad idea from the start, they said. And they were right. The world knew it. Even those who wore the uniform, the ones sent to sift the sand for hope, knew it. A silent understanding in the eyes, a weariness in the heart. The polls, they spoke their truth.  Seventy-five percent, eighty percent. A chorus of dissent rising from the earth itself.  The Iraqi dust, the smoke of burning oil, the ghosts of a shattered land. It clung to the air, a constant reminder of the folly. Democracy, they said, a seed sown in barren ground. A fragile thing, crushed beneath the weight of history.  Saddam, a tyrant, yes. But what good is a fallen king if his kingdom crumbles to dust?  The desert waits, patient and unforgiving. It swallows the past, the present, the future. What good is staying? What hope is there in the wasteland?",
            "The world, it ain't changed much. Not for women, anyway.  The glass ceiling, they call it.  Still there, though it's supposed to be shattered. Men, they got trouble seeing a woman at the head of the table. Like it ain't natural. Ain't right.  But you see it in every damn field.  \n\nTake a woman with the know-how, the qualifications, she's ready to climb. But the men at the top, they don't take her serious. They see a woman, they think weakness. History, it's a heavy thing, drags us down.\n\nSame for the men.  Tried to raise a child, stay home with the little ones?  They get the stink eye.  Society expects the man to be the provider, the breadwinner.  But what about the man who wants to nurture?  To hold his child, teach him, raise him?  He gets judged.  \n\nAnd in those fancy places, the fashion world, the men who love it, they get looked at funny.  Don't belong there, they say.  Too feminine. Like a man can't know beauty, can't understand style.  \n\nIt's a twisted thing, this world we live in.  Change is slow, gradual like the setting sun. We're getting there, though.  More women in the boardrooms, more men at home with the kids.  It's a fight, but we're fighting.",
            "They didn’t make it legal, no. Decriminalized it.  Knocked it down from a crime to a ticket.  Something you get cited for, not booked, not hauled in.  Still, the shadow of the charge, it lingers. Job interviews, all those things.  The weight of it, even with the label changed. \n\nKids worry about that. The future, the mark it leaves.  But the state, they spend a fortune catching, holding, charging.  A court appearance here, maybe two, three.  Public defenders, judges, the whole apparatus.  And for what?  A lot of municipalities, strapped for coin, they can’t afford to let go of that revenue.  Even if it frees up funds for schools, for the elderly, for the hungry.\n\nDenver’s different.  People there, they lean a different way.  Liberal, they call it.  More open.  And so maybe there, it makes sense.  The money saved, it can go elsewhere.\n\nBut to legalize it, to sell it like cigarettes,  that’s a different matter.  Everywhere, smoke curling from cars, from mouths on every street corner.  It wouldn’t feel right.  There’s a stigma, a taboo, that wouldn’t disappear that easy.\n\nAlcohol, it’s worse for your hands, maybe.  But weed, it twists your life, your habits.  Both bad in their own ways.  But people, they react different.  Some go wild, some find balance.  It’s hard to say.",
            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. They say tradition is a root, that it holds you firm. But roots can strangle, too. They cling to the old ways, the dust on the altars, the pronouncements from long dead men. And they judge. They judge the straying sheep, the ones who don't fit the fold. My mother, she walked a different path. Episcopalian. They wouldn't let them in the church.  She loved God, but they wouldn't have her.  Love them, they preach. But this love is a cage, a gilded cage, for the chosen few. They speak of grace, but they offer only judgment.  \n\nThey say priests should be above it all,  above the weight of the flesh. But the flesh is a heavy thing.  It yearns. It betrays. And in the dark, behind closed doors, the sanctity of the cloth can’t hold back the shadows.  A man’s hunger, it knows no commandments.  They say marriage would be a distraction, but the heart seeks connection, even in the darkest of places. Is it the cloth that corrupts, or the man beneath? \n\nI don’t know.  I only know the stain of hypocrisy, the smell of incense masking the stench of rot.",
            "The matter hangs heavy. No easy answers there. Right and wrong, a blurred line in the dust. This thing, the church and the state, tangled up with the very definition of a bond. A line walked on eggshells, lest we offend some corner of the world.  \n\nCivil unions, maybe. A simple joining. Two souls. The government, should it concern itself with the particulars of such a thing?  Baptized souls, they walk unseen by the ledger of the state. The same should hold true for those bound in marriage. A sacrament, a joining of hearts, not a legal instrument to be weighed and measured.\n\nBut if the states can find common ground, a logic to the matter, then let it rise, a federal law.  But to amend the Constitution, to ban this love, this union, that is a folly. The Constitution, a heavy thing, not to be tampered with for matters of fleeting passions. Let them live their lives, these souls bound by love. Leave the Constitution to rest.",
            "Raised in the fold. Christian. The word hangs, a shadow, over these matters.  Sexuality, a tangled vine, twisting in the light. Friends, some of them drawn towards the dark, the unspoken.  I don't know that I could walk that path myself. But the law, that's a different thing.  A heavy hand, reaching too far, dictating the lives of men.  The whole country, bound by a single decree?  No.  Let the states decide.  Let the people of each land choose their own way.  Some states lean left, some right.  The tide turns, the wind shifts.  Let them grapple with these questions, these choices.  A man can't choose his own home, but he can choose to abide by its laws.  Give them the same chance.  Equal footing.  Same as the rest.  Let the states decide.  And let the president, that distant hand, stay out of it. His power, it doesn't reach to every corner.",
            "The boy spoke slow.  His words hung heavy in the air, like smoke from some long-dead fire. \"It's public,\" he said. \"Like a bulletin board. If you put something out there, you gotta figure folks'll see it.  School folks too.\"  He paused, fiddling with a loose thread on his shirt. \n\n\"They weren't using the school's name or nothin',\" he continued, \"but they coulda found it. From their own homes.  Maybe it's wrong, maybe it ain't.  But if it stops some kid from gettin' hurt, well, that's a good thing, ain't it?  That's what schools are for. Keepin' folks safe.\"\n\nHe chewed on his lip, eyes fixed on the floor. \"You know, it's easier to say what you mean when you're writin'.  But when you're talkin', words get tangled up, like weeds in a ditch.\" He looked up, his gaze direct. \"Like I said, it's public. If you don't want folks seein' what you're sayin', you keep it to yourself.\"\n\nHe recalled a teacher, a woman with tired eyes and a voice worn thin from years of talkin' to kids. \"She said, 'We gotta be safe,' she said. 'We gotta be ready for anything.'\" He remembered the drills, the cold metal of the fire escape, the way the world seemed to shrink down to the size of that classroom. \"We practiced, just in case.  Didn't want to be caught off guard.\"\n\nHe sighed, the weight of it all settling on his shoulders.  \"That's what they were doin', I reckon. Just tryin' to keep folks safe. From somethin' bad.\"",
            "The war. A fevered thing. Nine eleven. It burned in ya. Made ya want to answer back.  Like fire for fire.  Go over there and make them feel what we felt.  But maybe that was the sickness. All that heat. Didn't leave room for thinking.  No time for plans. Just fire. And it backfired.  It always does.\n\nThey fight amongst themselves.  Cannibal country.  Us going in there, it don't matter. They'll tear each other apart anyway. Doesn't change a thing.  I used to care, I guess. About what went on over there. Now it's just a weariness. A dull ache. Don't know if they're human anymore.  Just shadows with hatred in their eyes.\n\nWe went in blind. Didn't know what we faced. They fight different.  Savages.  Not building, not mending. Just tearing.  They want us gone. And maybe that's the only thing they're right about.  We shouldn't be there. Just hype.  Revenge.  Bush, he wanted it too. They wanted it. A voice in the dark saying \"go.\" And we went.  \n\nNo thought. No plan. Just the echo of the fire."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community

every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. It has its ways. Old ways. The men in robes talk of dwindling numbers. A harvest failing. I reckon it's these things they hold tight to, these rigid stances. Marriage, the taking of life, the control of the body. They speak of sin and damnation. But the world, it turns. Times change.\n\nFolks don't bend so easy anymore. There's a restlessness out there, a hunger for something more. They see the Church, and they see a shadow. A darkness clinging to the corners of faith.\n\nThey say the Church is against abortion, against the joining of two souls in love, against the choices a woman makes. And some, they hear these words and walk away. They seek a different kind of sanctuary, one that doesn't judge, that doesn't condemn. \n\nA woman, a priestess, perhaps. A man, bound by vows but not to God alone.  These are the whispers in the wind. Could it have changed things? Maybe. But the darkness, it finds a way.",
            "The matter of marriage.  A man and a woman. Two men. Two women.  Seems a simple enough thing, wouldn't you say? But the world, it twists and turns.  Some folks born a certain way. Some not. Doesn't make 'em any less...human.  To deny them the right, to call it wrong.  Seems a hard thing to stomach. Not my place to judge, not my choice to make. The government, they meddle in things they don't understand. This ain't a question of law, ain't no law against love, against the way folks feel.  It's about right and wrong.  And that's a question for the heart, not for some suit in Washington.",
            "The matter of marriage, of two souls bound, is a thing the law should not hold in thrall. Some speak of threats, of the family structure warped by love between men or women. But what threat is there in devotion? In a world where shadows lengthen, where kinship is not always blood, is a love less true for lacking the shape prescribed?\n\nThe coin has two sides, yes. But it is the metal that matters, the heart that beats beneath. The law should not be a judge of the heart. There are rights, rights that bind, rights that shelter in sickness and in health. A partner denied, a hand held back, is a wound the law should not inflict.\n\nAnd the studies whisper, a chorus of voices, that love finds its form in many ways. Happiness blooms in fields of every hue, in gardens cultivated by hands of different shapes.\n\nThe church, a house of faith, should not hold dominion over the state. Let the state provide shelter, let it not dictate the shape of love.\n\nSome cling to ancient fears, to scriptures turned to iron bars. They speak of morality, of a path predestined. But morality is a shifting thing, a compass guided by the heart.\n\nTo deny a love, a bond forged in the fires of devotion, is to deny a part of the human story. It is to build walls where bridges should stand.  \n\nIt is in the embracing of difference, in the recognition of a love that knows no bounds, that we find the truest measure of humanity.",
            "The pharmacy. Summer work. You see these pills, these poisons, stacked high behind glass.  Just because a thing is outlawed doesn't mean it holds no use.  No, sir.  There's a line.  For the open market, no.  But for healing?  Yes.  Medicinal, maybe.  Just because it's dirty doesn't mean it ain't got its uses.  \n\nThink of the ones they keep locked tight, the oxycotins, the vicodins, the percocets.  Controlled, they call 'em.  But we dispense 'em daily.  For good, for bad.  Same with this weed. This marijuana.  They call it devil's lettuce, but it might just hold the key.  \n\nAlcohol.  That's a different beast.  You can drown yourself in it, mind and body.  But this, this herb, it's different.  It ain't a demon, not like the hard stuff.  \n\nMaybe a slow hand on the throttle.  Legalize it, yes, but not in a rush.  Let 'em get used to it, let the shame fade.  Then maybe, just maybe, they'll use it right.  \n\nSee, the fear they have... it's all made up.

            "The church, it’s changed. Like the wind shifts, it’s taken on a new shape. Not as stiff as it once was. I remember Sundays when I was a girl. Dresses all buttoned and laced. Shoes to match, a purse to match. Every Sunday, the ritual. Same as all the other girls. Private school, the whole lot of us, dressed up like dolls for mass. But now, it’s different. They’ve got a mass for the young ones, quick and sharp, thirty minutes gone in the blink of an eye. People come in their beach clothes, sand still clinging to their toes. Families rushing in late, children crying. Jeans and khakis now at the morning masses, where I used to stand stiff as a board in my Sunday best. \n\nThe politics of it all, I don’t know much about that. But the change, I see it. That’s the church I know now.   \n\nThe talk, the accusations against the priests.  Evil things. I don’t know if any change could have stopped it. There are married men, good men, who do bad things. It’s a sickness, a darkness inside. Like a storm cloud gathering. It don't matter if they’re married or not.\n\nThey choose to be priests. It’s a path they walk. Some churches, they let the priests marry.  Like on that show, “Seventh Heaven.” The preacher, he had a wife, had children. But for those who choose the priesthood, maybe it’s not the right path. Maybe they should find a different way to serve.\n\nThis whole thing, it’s in their blood. It’s in their genes, I think.  Like a sickness passed down. Can’t hide it with a wedding ring.  It’d come out anyway.\n\nIf they knew and covered it up, shame on them. But maybe, in some cases, they didn’t know.",
            "The laughter caught in his throat, a dry rasp. He'd tried to swallow it down, but the air itself felt thick with it. At first, he'd been okay, he supposed. But the day, that day, the world had tilted.  September's shadow had fallen long and heavy. And they went in, into that dust-filled land, under a guise, a pretense.  The Bush men, they'd tied it all together, the war, the towers, Bin Laden's shadow, Hussein's phantom weapons. A lie, all of it, a tapestry woven from smoke and fear.  It had chafed him, this deceit, this blood spilled in the name of a phantom enemy.  The Bush men, they'd lied to the people, plain and simple. Even Powell, the man who'd stood before the world and spun their tale, now admitted to doubt.  Malfeasance. An offense against the very heart of the nation.  \n\nHe saw it all, the slow erosion of the Constitution, the creeping darkness since the towers fell.  They'd come in, these men, with war in their eyes, a hunger for vengeance.  He recalled the name, a fleeting whisper, the treasury man who'd spoken truth, driven out like a dog.  The younger Bush, he'd carried the weight of his father's shadow, a thirst for retribution.  And oil. Always oil, the black blood whispering promises of power.\n\nIt had dragged on, this war, this wound festering in the land. A withdrawal, a sudden pullback, would only leave a bleeding corpse.  The UN, they'd spoken of a new order, a coalition, a patchwork of nations from the desert. But what guarantee was there?  Would Iraq's sovereignty be a hollow shell, a name whispered on the wind?\n\nHe saw the whispers, the news reports, the crumbling Parliament, the Prime Minister, a king without a kingdom.  Sadr, the man they'd fought, his name a ghost in the halls of power.  Factions, each clawing for control, each hungry for the spoils.  Friction, a slow burn, threatening to ignite the tinderbox. \n\nThe laughter came again, this time a choked sound, swallowed back down. Words, they failed him.  There were things, truths, he couldn't speak, not in this light.",
            "The air hung thick, hot.  The questions, they came like cicadas, buzzing in his ear.  Iraq. The word tasted like dust and ashes in his mouth.  A pointless thing, he thought. A reckoning, a score to settle.  But for what?  Ghosts of towers falling, a shadow cast across the world.  Nine-eleven.  A wound that wouldn't heal, festering.  He wasn't a soldier, never had been.  Didn't know the names of the battles, the faces of the lost.  Just knew the weight of it, the hollowness.  \n\nDemocracy, they said.  A seed planted in barren soil.  Oil, the black blood of the earth, a thirst that never quenched.  He saw the anger, the broken lives, the endless cycle of violence.  A land carved up, a people torn.  \n\nTo leave, to stay – both paths choked with thorns.  To fight, to build, to hold on.  The ghosts of Vietnam whispered in his ear, a warning.  A war without end, a stain on the nation's soul.  \n\nHe thought of the boys, the girls, the faces of the young, sent into the furnace.  And the families waiting, holding their breath, their hearts cracking.  He thought of the children, robbed of their laughter, their innocence.  A world drowned in blood, a future uncertain.  \n\nThe weight of it all, a burden too heavy to bear.  The war in Iraq, a tangled knot of shadows and lies.  No easy answers, only the echo of gunfire, the whisper of the wind through the ruins.",
            "The law, it ain't right. No state should lay claim to it. This ain't their business. The Bible it speaks. Church and state. Divided. Plain as day. You try to force it, to twist it to your will, you're spitting in the face of what's already carved in stone.  The ones pushing it down, they're picking and choosing.  Favor one flock over another. The Catholics, most of 'em stand against it.  The Christians too.  Except up in Boston, maybe a few outposts. But the government, they got no right to tell the churches what they can and can't preach.  Separation. That's the heart of it.  Tolerance.  \n\nTo amend the thing, that's just wrong. A contradiction. The only amendment I can think of that would chain the people, not the government.\n\nThis ain't the government's fight.  This ain't about the economy or the streets. It's about faith, about personal convictions. The man pushing this, he's just trying to impose his own beliefs on the rest of us. One religion over all the others.\n\nIt belongs to the churches. It belongs to the people. Not the president, not the politicians.",
            "The war. A long shadow. Iraq.  Didn't the government tell us the truth? About why they went in, why they claimed the desert was a battlefield.  A tangled web they spun, linking it to that September day, the smoke rising. But the desert held a different truth. A truth born of sand and blood. \n\nI've never been one for war.  Especially not this kind. A strike in the dark, preemptive. A gambler's bet with lives. Like Vietnam, a mirror held up, reflecting the ghosts of a past we refused to learn from. How many sons and daughters laid low, their dreams turned to dust?  And for what? To carve out a new order, to impose a government on a land that had a government of its own?  \n\nThey said they'd bring democracy. Like seeds sown in fertile ground. But the land was arid, its people hardened.  They fought not an army, but a spirit, a resistance born of grief and fear.  We thought it would be quick. A swift victory, a clean sweep.  But the desert doesn't yield easily. It swallows promises and spits out despair.\n\nWe've been there years now, still trying to mold the land to our will. Still teaching them to police themselves, to be the government we want them to be.  A long and bloody lesson, etched in the sand.  \n\nMaybe we should have stayed away. Maybe we should have learned from the ghosts of Vietnam.  Maybe the truth wasn't hidden in the desert, but staring back at us from the mirror. A mirror reflecting our own hubris, our own thirst for dominion.",
            "The boy spoke slow, drawling out the words like a hawk scanning the plains. \"I'm for it,\" he said, \"always have been.\" He squinted, as if the sun was too bright, or maybe he was just thinking hard. \"A man loves a man, a woman a woman. It's a thing of the blood, not of the mind. To take that away, to deny them a name, a place at the table... that's a sin. It's inhuman.\" His voice dropped to a whisper. \"My own street, there's a couple, two men, never married. They walk their dogs, like any other folks. They love each other. It's no different. But they can't say it, can't claim it.\" He spit on the ground. \"That man in Washington, trying to play God, twisting the words of love... it's a mockery.\"\n\nHe paused, his eyes distant. \"They say now, it's in the brain,  chemistry. Some things you're born with, can't help it. Like the sky, the rain, the pull of the earth.\" He sighed. \"It ain't like a boy growing up with sisters, yearning for a brother. That ain't it.\" He shook his head. \"It's a simple thing, love. Two people wanting to stay together, to build a life. Should be their own business, not the government's.\" \n\nHe looked away, his voice a low rumble. \"A man and a woman, they can run off, get hitched in Vegas. Nobody cares. But two men, two women... that's news. A scandal. It's wrong.\" He spat again, the sound sharp and metallic. \"Love should be private, not a spectacle. It's not theirs to control.\"",

Someone's gotta hear it. Someone's gotta act.  They can't just let it float, can they? What if it takes root? What if it blossoms? \n\nBut the line's blurry, ain't it?  Sometimes it's just kids, messing around.  A sociology project gone wrong, maybe. A bad joke, meant to be funny, but landing heavy as a tombstone.  \n\nThen there are the times when it's not a joke.  A seed of darkness, planted in the fertile ground of the net.  A boy, a friend, something he posted. A dark joke, maybe. But in the right light, it looked like a threat. \n\nThe school found out.

Now it's something else. A show of force. A hunger to prove dominion. Maybe the hunger was there all along. Bush the elder and his grudges with the desert fox. A serpent's coil tightening around a nation.  \n\nIf the aim had been to bring light to the darkness, to lift the weight of tyranny, that would have been a cause worthy of steel and blood. But if it was fueled by personal debts, by ghosts of battles past, then it was a sickness from the start.\n\nThe first strike, it spoke volumes. A thunderclap in the stillness. But the echo lingers. Years bleed into years. The desert sands turn red. And for what?

A nation doesn't find its voice in the roar of guns. \n\nThere are things to be done here, at home. A rot in the bones of our own land. Poverty, hunger, the slow decay of dreams. These are the battles that demand our attention. \n\nThe money, the endless money, it's a river flowing into a bottomless pit. A pit built of sand and dust, of promises broken and lives extinguished. \n\nThe time has come to turn away. To close the book on this chapter. To let the desert reclaim its own.

            "The desert wind scoured the edges of thought. This war. A stain on the sand. A bad idea from the start, they said. And they were right. The world knew it. Even those who wore the uniform, the ones sent to sift the sand for hope, knew it. A silent understanding in the eyes, a weariness in the heart. The polls, they spoke their truth.  Seventy-five percent, eighty percent. A chorus of dissent rising from the earth itself.  The Iraqi dust, the smoke of burning oil, the ghosts of a shattered land. It clung to the air, a constant reminder of the folly. Democracy, they said, a seed sown in barren ground. A fragile thing, crushed beneath the weight of history.  Saddam, a tyrant, yes. But what good is a fallen king if his kingdom crumbles to dust?  The desert waits, patient and unforgiving. It swallows the past, the present, the future. What good is staying? What hope is there in the wasteland?",
            "The world, it ain't changed much. Not for women, anyway.  The glass ceiling, they call it.  Still there, though it's supposed to be shattered. Men, they got trouble seeing a woman at the head of the table. Like it ain't natural. Ain't right.  But you see it in every damn field.  \n\nTake a woman with the know-how, the qualifications, she's ready to climb. But the men at the top, they don't take her serious. They see a woman, they think weakness. History, it's a heavy thing, drags us down.\n\nSame for the men.  Tried to raise a child, stay home with the little ones?  They get the stink eye.  Society expects the man to be the provider, the breadwinner.  But what about the man who wants to nurture?  To hold his child, teach him, raise him?  He gets judged.  \n\nAnd in those fancy places, the fashion world, the men who love it, they get looked at funny.  Don't belong there, they say.  Too feminine. Like a man can't know beauty, can't understand style.  \n\nIt's a twisted thing, this world we live in.  Change is slow, gradual like the setting sun. We're getting there, though.  More women in the boardrooms, more men at home with the kids.  It's a fight, but we're fighting.",
            "They didn’t make it legal, no. Decriminalized it.  Knocked it down from a crime to a ticket.  Something you get cited for, not booked, not hauled in.  Still, the shadow of the charge, it lingers. Job interviews, all those things.  The weight of it, even with the label changed. \n\nKids worry about that. The future, the mark it leaves.  But the state, they spend a fortune catching, holding, charging.  A court appearance here, maybe two, three.  Public defenders, judges, the whole apparatus.  And for what?  A lot of municipalities, strapped for coin, they can’t afford to let go of that revenue.  Even if it frees up funds for schools, for the elderly, for the hungry.\n\nDenver’s different.  People there, they lean a different way.  Liberal, they call it.  More open.  And so maybe there, it makes sense.  The money saved, it can go elsewhere.\n\nBut to legalize it, to sell it like cigarettes,  that’s a different matter.  Everywhere, smoke curling from cars, from mouths on every street corner.  It wouldn’t feel right.  There’s a stigma, a taboo, that wouldn’t disappear that easy.\n\nAlcohol, it’s worse for your hands, maybe.  But weed, it twists your life, your habits.  Both bad in their own ways.  But people, they react different.  Some go wild, some find balance.  It’s hard to say.",
            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. They say tradition is a root, that it holds you firm. But roots can strangle, too. They cling to the old ways, the dust on the altars, the pronouncements from long dead men. And they judge. They judge the straying sheep, the ones who don't fit the fold. My mother, she walked a different path. Episcopalian. They wouldn't let them in the church.  She loved God, but they wouldn't have her.  Love them, they preach. But this love is a cage, a gilded cage, for the chosen few. They speak of grace, but they offer only judgment.  \n\nThey say priests should be above it all,  above the weight of the flesh. But the flesh is a heavy thing.  It yearns. It betrays. And in the dark, behind closed doors, the sanctity of the cloth can’t hold back the shadows.  A man’s hunger, it knows no commandments.  They say marriage would be a distraction, but the heart seeks connection, even in the darkest of places. Is it the cloth that corrupts, or the man beneath? \n\nI don’t know.  I only know the stain of hypocrisy, the smell of incense masking the stench of rot.",
            "The matter hangs heavy. No easy answers there. Right and wrong, a blurred line in the dust. This thing, the church and the state, tangled up with the very definition of a bond. A line walked on eggshells, lest we offend some corner of the world.  \n\nCivil unions, maybe. A simple joining. Two souls. The government, should it concern itself with the particulars of such a thing?  Baptized souls, they walk unseen by the ledger of the state. The same should hold true for those bound in marriage. A sacrament, a joining of hearts, not a legal instrument to be weighed and measured.\n\nBut if the states can find common ground, a logic to the matter, then let it rise, a federal law.  But to amend the Constitution, to ban this love, this union, that is a folly. The Constitution, a heavy thing, not to be tampered with for matters of fleeting passions. Let them live their lives, these souls bound by love. Leave the Constitution to rest.",
            "Raised in the fold. Christian. The word hangs, a shadow, over these matters.  Sexuality, a tangled vine, twisting in the light. Friends, some of them drawn towards the dark, the unspoken.  I don't know that I could walk that path myself. But the law, that's a different thing.  A heavy hand, reaching too far, dictating the lives of men.  The whole country, bound by a single decree?  No.  Let the states decide.  Let the people of each land choose their own way.  Some states lean left, some right.  The tide turns, the wind shifts.  Let them grapple with these questions, these choices.  A man can't choose his own home, but he can choose to abide by its laws.  Give them the same chance.  Equal footing.  Same as the rest.  Let the states decide.  And let the president, that distant hand, stay out of it. His power, it doesn't reach to every corner.",
            "The boy spoke slow.  His words hung heavy in the air, like smoke from some long-dead fire. \"It's public,\" he said. \"Like a bulletin board. If you put something out there, you gotta figure folks'll see it.  School folks too.\"  He paused, fiddling with a loose thread on his shirt. \n\n\"They weren't using the school's name or nothin',\" he continued, \"but they coulda found it. From their own homes.  Maybe it's wrong, maybe it ain't.  But if it stops some kid from gettin' hurt, well, that's a good thing, ain't it?  That's what schools are for. Keepin' folks safe.\"\n\nHe chewed on his lip, eyes fixed on the floor. \"You know, it's easier to say what you mean when you're writin'.  But when you're talkin', words get tangled up, like weeds in a ditch.\" He looked up, his gaze direct. \"Like I said, it's public. If you don't want folks seein' what you're sayin', you keep it to yourself.\"\n\nHe recalled a teacher, a woman with tired eyes and a voice worn thin from years of talkin' to kids. \"She said, 'We gotta be safe,' she said. 'We gotta be ready for anything.'\" He remembered the drills, the cold metal of the fire escape, the way the world seemed to shrink down to the size of that classroom. \"We practiced, just in case.  Didn't want to be caught off guard.\"\n\nHe sighed, the weight of it all settling on his shoulders.  \"That's what they were doin', I reckon. Just tryin' to keep folks safe. From somethin' bad.\"",
            "The war. A fevered thing. Nine eleven. It burned in ya. Made ya want to answer back.  Like fire for fire.  Go over there and make them feel what we felt.  But maybe that was the sickness. All that heat. Didn't leave room for thinking.  No time for plans. Just fire. And it backfired.  It always does.\n\nThey fight amongst themselves.  Cannibal country.  Us going in there, it don't matter. They'll tear each other apart anyway. Doesn't change a thing.  I used to care, I guess. About what went on over there. Now it's just a weariness. A dull ache. Don't know if they're human anymore.  Just shadows with hatred in their eyes.\n\nWe went in blind. Didn't know what we faced. They fight different.  Savages.  Not building, not mending. Just tearing.  They want us gone. And maybe that's the only thing they're right about.  We shouldn't be there. Just hype.  Revenge.  Bush, he wanted it too. They wanted it. A voice in the dark saying \"go.\" And we went.  \n\nNo thought. No plan. Just the echo of the fire."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community

every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. It speaks of things long past, of sins and sacraments, of a time when the world held different truths. Yet the world has turned, the wind has shifted. And the whispers grow louder. They say the pews are emptying, the flock scattering. The old doctrines, once ironclad, now seem brittle, cracked by the weight of modern doubt.\n\nThey speak of marriage, of love between men and between women, of choice in the matter of life's beginning. These are things the Church holds fast against, a wall of dogma built against the tide of change. But the tide rises ever higher.\n\nI've heard tell of those who feel the Church's embrace grow cold, who find its pronouncements a burden rather than a blessing. They seek solace elsewhere, in a faith that bends with the times, that recognizes the complexities of the human heart.\n\nThe Church might cling to its ancient ways, but the world moves on. Whether it can weather the storm, whether it can find a way to bridge the chasm that widens, remains to be seen.",
            "The notion of marriage, a man and a woman joined, that's the way things have always been. But now they say two men can join, or two women.  It don't feel right. Like a wrong turn taken down a dusty road. They say it's a choice, but the heart don't choose. It just is.  \n\nI don't think the government has a say in how the heart beats. It's a thing between people, between souls.  \n\nThese folks, they're born that way, just like the rest of us. Can't blame a sparrow for its wings. Can't blame a man for how he feels. \n\nThe government, they got enough to worry about without meddling in the affairs of the heart. Leave that to the Lord, or maybe to the wind.",
            "The marriage of men to men. A thing they call unnatural. A stain upon the fabric of the family. But what is natural? What is family? Two souls bound by a hunger, a need, a truth that sings in the bone. Is it not the same song, sung in different keys?\n\nThey say it threatens the heterosexual norm. That it unravels the threads of society. But what of the threads already frayed, the seams already splitting? What of the young hearts yearning for love, for acceptance, for a place to call home? Are we to deny them this, to cast them out, to tell them their love is less than, their bonds weaker? \n\nThe law, they say, is the shield of the righteous. But what of the law that denies the very right to exist? To be seen? To be whole? To share in the light and the shadow of a life together?  They speak of property and healthcare, of rights and responsibilities. But these are merely tools, mere instruments in the grand orchestra of life. The music itself, the melody of love, transcends such earthly concerns.\n\nThey talk of churches and states, of separation and entanglement. But can love be contained by such flimsy walls? Can it be bargained for, traded, or legislated away? They cling to scripture, to dogma, to pronouncements from the pulpit. But the whisper of the heart, the echo of the soul, speaks a language older than any book.\n\nAnd what of the children? They fear what they do not understand. But children are resilient, adaptable creatures. They learn from love, from compassion, from the warmth of a home built on acceptance, not judgment.\n\nLet us not be blinded by fear. Let us not be swayed by prejudice. Let us not allow the darkness to win. Let us choose love. Let us choose justice. Let us choose equality. For in the end, it is not the law that defines us, but the love that binds us.",

They say a drug's illegality speaks to its worth, but that's a lie the law tells itself.  There's good in some things the law keeps out.  Medicine, they call it. Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets.  Controlled.  But controlled for who?  The people who need them? The ones who suffer?  Marijuana, they say.  Taboo.  But why?  What's the harm in easing the ache, the pain?  It ain't no heroin, no cocaine.  Just a whisper of relief.  A shadow in the corner of the eye.  We fear what we don't understand.  That's how the darkness wins.  Let the light in.  Let them use it.  Let them heal.",
            "The church, it's changed.  Softened. Not the iron fist it once was. I remember Sundays. Dresses. Shoes. A purse to match. Sunday school. All of us in our finery. A parade of innocence.  \n\nNow, they have these teen masses. Thirty minutes. In and out. Folks in beach clothes, still damp from the salt, families hurrying in late.  Even the morning masses, the ones I used to dress for, folks are in jeans and khakis.  Casual.\n\nThat's the thing that strikes you.  The change.  Ain't no politics to it, just a shift in the air.  The church I know now, it's different.\n\nRegarding the men, the accusations...they're a stain.  But you can't tell me marriage would have stopped it.  There are men, married men, who prey.  It's not the vows, it's something else.  Some darkness they carry.\n\nThey choose this path, this priesthood.  They know the rules.  Other faiths, they allow marriage.  Seventh Heaven, that show, the preacher, he's got a wife and kids.  If a man craves that life, maybe he should look elsewhere.\n\nIt's a sickness, this pedophilia.  Genetics, maybe.  Something hardwired.  Can't be changed with a wedding ring.  They may try to hide it, but it always bleeds out. The church, they should've known, should've done better.  But maybe, just maybe, some things are beyond their reach.",

Bin Laden, Hussein, weapons of mass destruction.  A tangled web of lies spun by men in suits, men who spoke with forked tongues. Powell, himself, later admitted he'd been blind.  Sold a war on false pretenses, a betrayal of the very people they swore to protect.  Malfeasance, I call it.  Impeachable.  \n\nThey came in with blood in their hearts, those men.  Vengeance for a father, oil fields shimmering in their eyes.  The Constitution, a discarded parchment, trampled underfoot.  A thirst for power, a hunger for control.\n\nNow the country bleeds anew.  A swamp of warring factions, a parliament hollowed out by fear and ambition.  Sadr, a phantom, a name whispered in the dark, now sits with power in his grasp.  The future, a canvas stained with the blood of the innocent.  \n\nNo easy answers, no clean exits.  Just the slow, grinding churn of history repeating itself.",
            "The desert wind. It scours the land bare.  Same as the war. Leaves nothing but dust and ruin. The Iraq thing. A shadow hanging over the country. A pointless fight, some might say.  No declaration, just a whisper of justification. They say it was payback, for the smoke and the ash that fell on that bright September day.  But what good comes from the desert's sting?  Democracy, they say. Another American outpost. A wellspring of oil. But blood stains the sand, and the ground cries out.\n\nIt's a slow burn, this war.  A festering wound.  They build schools, they say, but the bombs keep falling. They try to teach freedom, but the shadows of fear linger.  If we leave, they'll be left to pick up the pieces, to rebuild a world shattered by our hands.  And if we stay, will we ever truly leave?  Will we erase their history, their way of life, and replace it with our own?\n\nThe President, he carries the weight of it all.  A burden on his shoulders.  They call him names, whisper of another Vietnam.  A war without end, a stain on the nation's soul.  \n\nHe looks out at the faces of the families, the mothers and fathers, the sons and daughters.  They want their loved ones home. They want an end to the sorrow.  But the desert whispers, and the ghosts of the fallen linger.  The echo of gunfire, the screams of the wounded, the scent of death on the wind.  It's a tangled web, this war. No easy answers, no simple solutions. Only the dust and the silence.",

To force their own sins on others? That's a defiance of the very words etched in stone.  \n\nThose who'd make it illegal, they choose one church's dogma over another. The Catholics, the Christians, most look upon it with scorn. But let the man in the pulpit preach, let the sinner listen. It ain't the government's place to decide what sins are buried and which ones rise. \n\nSeparation, that's what built this country. A haven for every creed, every belief. To amend it now, to shackle the soul, that's a path to damnation. It'd be the only amendment that chains the people, not the power. A backward step, a stain on the soul of this land.\n\nLet the churches decide their own battles. Let the government tend to roads and bridges. This ain't their fight. No, sir. It's between the man and his God, and that's a reckoning for another time.",

The government spun a yarn, played on fear, and the people, wounded and raw, swallowed it whole. 2003. A nation marched into the desert,  a sun-baked landscape that would become a graveyard.\n\nThey called it preemptive. A strike against the darkness before it found them. But war is a wound that festers, a beast that cannot be caged.  \n\nIt echoes, this war, with the ghosts of Vietnam. A quagmire, a struggle for a soul that isn't yours to claim.  They went in, boots on the sand,  to build a new order, a democracy. But the desert doesn't yield so easily. \n\nThey toppled the old king, the old ways, but the void is a hungry thing. Chaos bloomed. And the old wounds, they festered anew. How do you build a nation on the bones of the broken? They tried, these men, these soldiers, in the heat and the dust, but the insurgents were shadows, whispers in the wind. Fighting a ghost is a losing battle.\n\nThey were promised a swift victory. A clean sweep. But wars are rarely clean. They leave scars, not just on the land, but on the soul.\n\nThe blood spilled, the boys sent home in boxes, a sacrifice for what?  For oil, perhaps? For power? For an ideal that the desert couldn't comprehend? \n\nWe're still there, years later, watching the slow, agonizing dance of rebuilding. A nation broken, trying to find its way. And the question lingers: was it worth it? Was it ever worth it?",

It’s a word that should mean no more than two souls choosing to walk together under the same sun. Love, in its simplest form. But they make it a battleground. A political football.\n\nI believe in that love. Always have. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, it matters not. It's a fire in the blood, a current in the soul. Not some choice made at a dinner table or in some church pew. It's a thing of nature.\n\nThese politicians, they speak of God's will. But who are they to play God? Who are they to judge the desires of the heart?  What do they know of the ache of longing, the pull of something deeper than the flesh?  \n\nLook around. There are families in every corner, bound not by laws, but by love. Families built on laughter and shared dreams, on whispered secrets and hands clasped together in the dark.  They walk the streets, they raise their children, they live their lives, just as any other family.\n\nAnd what are they denied by these laws? What right is taken from them? The right to love? The right to build a life together? It's a cruel joke, a mockery of humanity.\n\nLet them love. Let them be. It's not for us to tell them otherwise. It's their story, their journey, their right.",

Like flyshit on a dusty window.\"\n\nHe paused, eyes fixed on some unseen point in the distance. \"As a resident advisor, I've seen it. Heard it. A kid talking about blowing things up, about shootings. Someone hears it, someone tells. The school has to act. God forbid something happens. Their asses are on the line. Silence can be taken for complicity.\"\n\nA shadow crossed his face. \"But you don't know what's real anymore. Kids slinging words like stones, testing the wind. Could be a joke. Could be a bad experiment gone sour. A sociology class, something like that. Or it could be the real thing. The thing that makes your blood run cold.\"\n\nHe looked at me, eyes hard. \"A kid's whispered words, overheard in the hallway. A friend, worried, combing through Facebook, finding things that seem harmless, until they don't. The internet, it's a mirror. Reflects back what you put in. But it's also a weapon.

To bring light to a land shrouded in darkness. But the light, it seems, has flickered and died. Now it’s a different beast altogether. A hunger, a need to prove something. To be the strong hand, the iron fist. \n\nThe reasons, they were murky from the start.  A father's old scores settled on a son's battlefield.  A legacy built on shadows.  If the aim was to lift a people from tyranny, then good. That, at least, was a reason worthy of blood. But the blood, it spills on and on.  \n\nThey said the start was enough. A statement, a show of force.  But the statement ran on, a broken record scratching across time. Years bleed into years. The purpose, it wears thin.  The enemy, they adapt.  We, we become the monsters we sought to destroy. \n\nThere comes a time when a man must stand alone.  When the fight becomes a burden, a stain on the soul. We've bled ourselves dry, pouring our wealth into a bottomless pit.  While our own streets crumble, our own children hunger.  \n\nThe money, it could build schools, mend roads, heal the sick. Instead, it feeds the machine of war.  A machine that grinds on, fueled by fear and pride, with no end in sight. \n\nIt's time to let go. Time to turn the tide, to find another path.

            "The question hung in the air, a thin wisp of smoke. Prevented, he said. By someone sifting through the digital dust, finding a spark in the static. A violation, maybe. Or was it? On those sites, the MySpaces and Facebooks, the lines blurred. Information spilled out like water from a cracked dam. Once put out there, it belonged to the wind. You gave it away when you pressed that button, when you clicked accept. A friend, a stranger, it didn't matter. They saw what you let them see.\n\nHe paused, the weight of the words settling like ash in his throat. To watch over them all, to sift through the digital lives of every student, that seemed a lonely task. A cruel one. But what if it was necessary? What if a life hung in the balance? A single profile, a whispered warning, a glimpse into the darkness.\n\nHe thought of the man on the screen, the one who'd shown how easy it was to pry into the lives of others. A screen name here, a message there, a meeting arranged in minutes. He thought of the classmates who knew his name, his habits, his friends, without ever having met him face to face. The fear, the unease, the feeling of being watched, even when alone.\n\nHe remembered the story of the high school, the ban on Myspace. A school trying to control the uncontrollable. A futile gesture, a thin wall against the flood. Was it privacy they were trying to protect, or something else? He didn't know.\n\nAll he knew was the world had changed. The lines had blurred. And the things that were once private were now for anyone who cared to look.",

But the truth is, the air was thick with it, the bad scent of it. It hung over everything.  Most folks knew. Even the men in suits, they knew it was a mistake, but pride, it's a stubborn thing. They'd rather choke on their own lies than admit they were wrong. \n\nThe polls, they tell the story. Seventy-five, eighty percent. All over the world, they see it for what it is: a wound that festers. Even in the desert, where the sand whispers secrets, they know.  The soldiers, those boys sent to bleed on that cursed soil, they know too. They say they're better off gone. \n\nIt was a disaster before we even stepped foot there, a bad seed planted in fertile ground. Now, pulling out, it's like trying to untangle a knotted rope, the more you pull, the more tangled it gets.  \n\nThe gulf between us, it's vast. Cultures clash, a symphony of discord. They think democracy can be force-fed, like some kind of cheap medicine. They don't understand.  Saddam, a monster, yes. But is that a reason to unleash another?\n\nWe're stuck in quicksand, drowning in it. There's no exit, only a slow, agonizing descent. I don't know what to say, except to get out. Leave them to their own devices.  Let them decide their own fate. \n\nThey've been telling us to leave for years. They know better. We stand there, a monument to our own hubris. The good guys? No. Never. But there's a flicker of hope, a chance to walk away from the slaughter, a chance to start again.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and forgotten things.  The question, it settled on him like a shroud. Gender.  A sickness in the bones of the country. He felt it, sure as a sunrise followed by the sting of cold wind.  Not just on the women, though they bore the brunt of it.  The scales tipped different in every valley, every field of work.  \n\nWomen, they had the glass roof, a ceiling made of whispered expectations. Even with equality on their lips, men still chafed at the thought of a woman in command.  The old ways, they clung to them like moss on a tombstone. A woman with the qualifications, the drive, the fire in her eyes, still found herself looking up, not at the top, but at a wall.  A wall built of prejudice, cemented by generations of men who thought the world belonged to them.\n\nAnd the men, they weren't free either.  In the world of fashion, a man in a finely tailored suit could be met with suspicion.  His taste questionable, his motives suspect.  The world, it saw a man in a world of lace and silk, and it recoiled. \n\nStaying home, raising children, a man doing that?  A strange sight, like a bird flying backwards.  Society, it judged, it pointed fingers, it whispered about what a man *should* be doing.  Working, providing, the lifeblood of the family.  But what about the dreams that whispered in the quiet hours? What about the heart that yearned to nurture and guide?  They were buried, like seeds in the hard earth, under the weight of expectation.\n\nChange, it was slow, a river carving its path through stone.  But it was happening. Women rising, men breaking free from the chains of what was expected of them.  The world was a tapestry, woven with threads of difference, and it was time to let those threads shine.",
            "They didn't legalize it. No. Decriminalized. Dropped it down. From a crime to a citation. Like a parking ticket. You get a notice, not the wagon. No booking, no jail. It lingers though, even lessened. Job interviews, all that. The stain of the charge, even if it ain't on your record.\n\nSee, it costs. Arrest, court, housing, lawyers. A whole apparatus churning. And towns, strapped for cash, they cling to the revenue. Even when it means locking up folks for a leaf. \n\nBut in places like Denver, where the wind blows a little different, they see the dollar signs. Money for schools, for the old folks, for the hungry. A trade-off.\n\nBut the open air, the streets... that's a different kind of reckoning. Like cigarettes, sold at every gas pump? Everywhere... smoke hanging in the air. Driving, dazed. Not right. It’s still a shadow thing.  \n\nThey say alcohol’s worse, for the hands, for the mind. But weed, it gets in your bones. Changes you.  \n\nAnd folks, they don't react the same. Some go full throttle, others tread light.  The devil's in the individual.",
            "The church. A place of old ways. Of timeworn rituals and doctrines etched in stone.  A comfort to some, a cage to others. They cling to their traditions, these Catholics, as if the world were a shifting tide that threatened to sweep them away. But the world changes. The wind blows. And sometimes, the old ways can suffocate the soul.\n\nThey speak of tolerance, of love for all. Yet they turn their backs on those who don't fit their narrow mold. My father, an Episcopalian, was deemed unworthy.  My mother, a Catholic, forced to choose between faith and family. A marriage denied, a love condemned. Hypocrisy hangs heavy in the air, thick as incense.\n\nThe scriptures speak of love, but the practice whispers of judgment. They speak of forgiveness, but their pronouncements sting like lashes. The doctrines, ancient and dusty, offer little solace in a world where shadows lengthen and questions deepen.\n\nThey say allowing priests to marry would invite chaos. That it would stain the sacred cloth with the mire of earthly desires. But what of the stain that already lingers, the darkness that festers in the heart of man? Can a sacrament truly cleanse a soul burdened with such sin? \n\nThe child, innocent and vulnerable, becomes a victim in this twisted game. And the priest, cloaked in robes of power, becomes the predator.  Love and forgiveness, these are hollow words when uttered by those who turn a blind eye to the suffering they perpetuate.\n\nChange is coming. The tide is turning. And the old ways will crumble.",
            "This matter, it’s a tangled thing. No easy answers. The line between the church’s domain and the state’s, a thin one.  And how to define marriage, to speak it into being, well that’s a dance on a knife’s edge. To offend none, a near impossibility.  \n\nI’ve thought on it, long thought. This civil union, it’s a thing. Two souls bound. Should the government, they who tax the living and bury the dead, have a say in the sacrament of it all? Baptism, communion, these things are between the soul and the heavens. The state takes no interest.  And marriage, should it be no different? A union, a joining, that’s all it is. No need for government’s stamp of approval, their blessing. \n\nStates, they can come to their own understanding, their own conclusions. But this talk of amendments, of tearing at the very fabric of the Constitution, over a matter of the heart, it’s a hollow pursuit.  Some may cry for it, some may need it, but this cause, it’s not a tremor that shakes the foundations of the nation. \n\nNo, it’s something far simpler, far more human. Two souls bound. Two lives entwined.",
            "The man raised in the house of God. Home was a place of cross and hymn and the weight of scripture. But the world outside, the world of boys he knew, the world of affection that folded in on itself like a prayer, that was a different kind of geography. A place where lines blurred and shadows stretched. He saw the good in them, the way they loved and held, the way their laughter echoed in the night. Yet the teachings, the truths laid down, they sat heavy in his gut like a stone.  \n\nHe believed their right to choose, to love, should be theirs alone. Not the business of the state, not the decree of a man in a high office.  For the South was different from the North, the plains from the mountains. Each place its own creed, its own dance with light and shadow.  The law, it should follow the land, the people, the breath of the earth.  It shouldn't be handed down from on high, a single edict for a land as vast and varied as this.  \n\nLet the states decide. Let them wrestle with the question, let them find their own answer. For in the end, it was the people who lived with the consequences, not the man in the suit, not the one who held the power. And power, he knew, was a dangerous thing, a river that could drown a man if he allowed it.",
            "The way I see it, Myspace is a public place. Like a bulletin board. Open to all. If you post somethin', you're puttin' it out there.  Anyone can see it. School folks included. \n\nNow, if you think they can't see it just 'cause they're not usin' the school's name, you're wrong. They can get to it from home. From anywhere.\n\nBut let me tell you somethin'. If it stops a school shootin', if it saves those kids, then I say they had the right to look. It's the school's responsibility. They gotta keep those kids safe.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's right to go snoopin' through kids' profiles just lookin' for trouble.  Catchin' 'em drinkin' or smokin', that ain't right. That's an invasion. But if they got a lead, somethin' that could stop somethin' bad from happenin', then I say they should do what they gotta do.\n\nIt's a line, ain't it?  You put somethin' out there, you gotta be ready for it to come back.  Like a boomerang. The internet ain't forgetful.  \n\nI've heard tell that even emails get dug up later. Years down the road.  Somethin' you thought was private, gone and come back to bite you.\n\nIt's a dangerous world out there. And sometimes, safety comes first.",
            "The war. A kind of fever. It took hold after the fall. A wound opened, raw and bleeding. Nine Eleven. A day seared into the bone. I remember the rage. The need for vengeance. To take the fight to them. To break them. \n\nBut the fire cooled. The dust settled. And the truth began to show. We went in blind. No map, no plan. Just the echo of the fall, a hollow drumbeat in the desert. We thought to bring order, to bring light. But the land was already steeped in darkness. \n\nThey fight amongst themselves, these people.  Sons against sons. Brother against brother. What good is war against a shadow? We were no savior. Just another force in the endless churn.  \n\nThe president, he spoke of freedom, of liberation. But freedom tasted like dust in the wind. A hollow promise. We left a scar on the land, not a blessing. \n\nMaybe it was always hopeless. Maybe we were never meant to change them.  Maybe we were just meant to fight. To leave them to their own devices, their own savage dance. \n\nNow the anger has faded. A weary resignation hangs in the air. We built nothing lasting. Just ghosts. And the dust."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. It speaks of things long past, of sins and sacraments, of a time when the world held different truths. Yet the world has turned, the wind has shifted. And the whispers grow louder. They say the pews are emptying, the flock scattering. The old doctrines, once ironclad, now seem brittle, cracked by the weight of modern doubt.\n\nThey speak of marriage, of love between men and between women, of choice in the matter of life's beginning. These are things the Church holds fast against, a wall of dogma built against the tide of change. But the tide rises ever higher.\n\nI've heard tell of those who feel the Church's embrace grow cold, who find its pronouncements a burden rather than a blessing. They seek solace elsewhere, in a faith that bends with the times, that recognizes the complexities of the human heart.\n\nThe Church might cling to its ancient ways, but the world moves on. Whether it can weather the storm, whether it can find a way to bridge the chasm that widens, remains to be seen.",
            "The notion of marriage, a man and a woman joined, that's the way things have always been. But now they say two men can join, or two women.  It don't feel right. Like a wrong turn taken down a dusty road. They say it's a choice, but the heart don't choose. It just is.  \n\nI don't think the government has a say in how the heart beats. It's a thing between people, between souls.  \n\nThese folks, they're born that way, just like the rest of us. Can't blame a sparrow for its wings. Can't blame a man for how he feels. \n\nThe government, they got enough to worry about without meddling in the affairs of the heart. Leave that to the Lord, or maybe to the wind.",
            "The marriage of men to men. A thing they call unnatural. A stain upon the fabric of the family. But what is natural? What is family? Two souls bound by a hunger, a need, a truth that sings in the bone. Is it not the same song, sung in different keys?\n\nThey say it threatens the heterosexual norm. That it unravels the threads of society. But what of the threads already frayed, the seams already splitting? What of the young hearts yearning for love, for acceptance, for a place to call home? Are we to deny them this, to cast them out, to tell them their love is less than, their bonds weaker? \n\nThe law, they say, is the shield of the righteous. But what of the law that denies the very right to exist? To be seen? To be whole? To share in the light and the shadow of a life together?  They speak of property and healthcare, of rights and responsibilities. But these are merely tools, mere instruments in the grand orchestra of life. The music itself, the melody of love, transcends such earthly concerns.\n\nThey talk of churches and states, of separation and entanglement. But can love be contained by such flimsy walls? Can it be bargained for, traded, or legislated away? They cling to scripture, to dogma, to pronouncements from the pulpit. But the whisper of the heart, the echo of the soul, speaks a language older than any book.\n\nAnd what of the children? They fear what they do not understand. But children are resilient, adaptable creatures. They learn from love, from compassion, from the warmth of a home built on acceptance, not judgment.\n\nLet us not be blinded by fear. Let us not be swayed by prejudice. Let us not allow the darkness to win. Let us choose love. Let us choose justice. Let us choose equality. For in the end, it is not the law that defines us, but the love that binds us.",

They say a drug's illegality speaks to its worth, but that's a lie the law tells itself.  There's good in some things the law keeps out.  Medicine, they call it. Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets.  Controlled.  But controlled for who?  The people who need them? The ones who suffer?  Marijuana, they say.  Taboo.  But why?  What's the harm in easing the ache, the pain?  It ain't no heroin, no cocaine.  Just a whisper of relief.  A shadow in the corner of the eye.  We fear what we don't understand.  That's how the darkness wins.  Let the light in.  Let them use it.  Let them heal.",
            "The church, it's changed.  Softened. Not the iron fist it once was. I remember Sundays. Dresses. Shoes. A purse to match. Sunday school. All of us in our finery. A parade of innocence.  \n\nNow, they have these teen masses. Thirty minutes. In and out. Folks in beach clothes, still damp from the salt, families hurrying in late.  Even the morning masses, the ones I used to dress for, folks are in jeans and khakis.  Casual.\n\nThat's the thing that strikes you.  The change.  Ain't no politics to it, just a shift in the air.  The church I know now, it's different.\n\nRegarding the men, the accusations...they're a stain.  But you can't tell me marriage would have stopped it.  There are men, married men, who prey.  It's not the vows, it's something else.  Some darkness they carry.\n\nThey choose this path, this priesthood.  They know the rules.  Other faiths, they allow marriage.  Seventh Heaven, that show, the preacher, he's got a wife and kids.  If a man craves that life, maybe he should look elsewhere.\n\nIt's a sickness, this pedophilia.  Genetics, maybe.  Something hardwired.  Can't be changed with a wedding ring.  They may try to hide it, but it always bleeds out. The church, they should've known, should've done better.  But maybe, just maybe, some things are beyond their reach.",

Bin Laden, Hussein, weapons of mass destruction.  A tangled web of lies spun by men in suits, men who spoke with forked tongues. Powell, himself, later admitted he'd been blind.  Sold a war on false pretenses, a betrayal of the very people they swore to protect.  Malfeasance, I call it.  Impeachable.  \n\nThey came in with blood in their hearts, those men.  Vengeance for a father, oil fields shimmering in their eyes.  The Constitution, a discarded parchment, trampled underfoot.  A thirst for power, a hunger for control.\n\nNow the country bleeds anew.  A swamp of warring factions, a parliament hollowed out by fear and ambition.  Sadr, a phantom, a name whispered in the dark, now sits with power in his grasp.  The future, a canvas stained with the blood of the innocent.  \n\nNo easy answers, no clean exits.  Just the slow, grinding churn of history repeating itself.",
            "The desert wind. It scours the land bare.  Same as the war. Leaves nothing but dust and ruin. The Iraq thing. A shadow hanging over the country. A pointless fight, some might say.  No declaration, just a whisper of justification. They say it was payback, for the smoke and the ash that fell on that bright September day.  But what good comes from the desert's sting?  Democracy, they say. Another American outpost. A wellspring of oil. But blood stains the sand, and the ground cries out.\n\nIt's a slow burn, this war.  A festering wound.  They build schools, they say, but the bombs keep falling. They try to teach freedom, but the shadows of fear linger.  If we leave, they'll be left to pick up the pieces, to rebuild a world shattered by our hands.  And if we stay, will we ever truly leave?  Will we erase their history, their way of life, and replace it with our own?\n\nThe President, he carries the weight of it all.  A burden on his shoulders.  They call him names, whisper of another Vietnam.  A war without end, a stain on the nation's soul.  \n\nHe looks out at the faces of the families, the mothers and fathers, the sons and daughters.  They want their loved ones home. They want an end to the sorrow.  But the desert whispers, and the ghosts of the fallen linger.  The echo of gunfire, the screams of the wounded, the scent of death on the wind.  It's a tangled web, this war. No easy answers, no simple solutions. Only the dust and the silence.",

To force their own sins on others? That's a defiance of the very words etched in stone.  \n\nThose who'd make it illegal, they choose one church's dogma over another. The Catholics, the Christians, most look upon it with scorn. But let the man in the pulpit preach, let the sinner listen. It ain't the government's place to decide what sins are buried and which ones rise. \n\nSeparation, that's what built this country. A haven for every creed, every belief. To amend it now, to shackle the soul, that's a path to damnation. It'd be the only amendment that chains the people, not the power. A backward step, a stain on the soul of this land.\n\nLet the churches decide their own battles. Let the government tend to roads and bridges. This ain't their fight. No, sir. It's between the man and his God, and that's a reckoning for another time.",

The government spun a yarn, played on fear, and the people, wounded and raw, swallowed it whole. 2003. A nation marched into the desert,  a sun-baked landscape that would become a graveyard.\n\nThey called it preemptive. A strike against the darkness before it found them. But war is a wound that festers, a beast that cannot be caged.  \n\nIt echoes, this war, with the ghosts of Vietnam. A quagmire, a struggle for a soul that isn't yours to claim.  They went in, boots on the sand,  to build a new order, a democracy. But the desert doesn't yield so easily. \n\nThey toppled the old king, the old ways, but the void is a hungry thing. Chaos bloomed. And the old wounds, they festered anew. How do you build a nation on the bones of the broken? They tried, these men, these soldiers, in the heat and the dust, but the insurgents were shadows, whispers in the wind. Fighting a ghost is a losing battle.\n\nThey were promised a swift victory. A clean sweep. But wars are rarely clean. They leave scars, not just on the land, but on the soul.\n\nThe blood spilled, the boys sent home in boxes, a sacrifice for what?  For oil, perhaps? For power? For an ideal that the desert couldn't comprehend? \n\nWe're still there, years later, watching the slow, agonizing dance of rebuilding. A nation broken, trying to find its way. And the question lingers: was it worth it? Was it ever worth it?",

It’s a word that should mean no more than two souls choosing to walk together under the same sun. Love, in its simplest form. But they make it a battleground. A political football.\n\nI believe in that love. Always have. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, it matters not. It's a fire in the blood, a current in the soul. Not some choice made at a dinner table or in some church pew. It's a thing of nature.\n\nThese politicians, they speak of God's will. But who are they to play God? Who are they to judge the desires of the heart?  What do they know of the ache of longing, the pull of something deeper than the flesh?  \n\nLook around. There are families in every corner, bound not by laws, but by love. Families built on laughter and shared dreams, on whispered secrets and hands clasped together in the dark.  They walk the streets, they raise their children, they live their lives, just as any other family.\n\nAnd what are they denied by these laws? What right is taken from them? The right to love? The right to build a life together? It's a cruel joke, a mockery of humanity.\n\nLet them love. Let them be. It's not for us to tell them otherwise. It's their story, their journey, their right.",

Like flyshit on a dusty window.\"\n\nHe paused, eyes fixed on some unseen point in the distance. \"As a resident advisor, I've seen it. Heard it. A kid talking about blowing things up, about shootings. Someone hears it, someone tells. The school has to act. God forbid something happens. Their asses are on the line. Silence can be taken for complicity.\"\n\nA shadow crossed his face. \"But you don't know what's real anymore. Kids slinging words like stones, testing the wind. Could be a joke. Could be a bad experiment gone sour. A sociology class, something like that. Or it could be the real thing. The thing that makes your blood run cold.\"\n\nHe looked at me, eyes hard. \"A kid's whispered words, overheard in the hallway. A friend, worried, combing through Facebook, finding things that seem harmless, until they don't. The internet, it's a mirror. Reflects back what you put in. But it's also a weapon.

To bring light to a land shrouded in darkness. But the light, it seems, has flickered and died. Now it’s a different beast altogether. A hunger, a need to prove something. To be the strong hand, the iron fist. \n\nThe reasons, they were murky from the start.  A father's old scores settled on a son's battlefield.  A legacy built on shadows.  If the aim was to lift a people from tyranny, then good. That, at least, was a reason worthy of blood. But the blood, it spills on and on.  \n\nThey said the start was enough. A statement, a show of force.  But the statement ran on, a broken record scratching across time. Years bleed into years. The purpose, it wears thin.  The enemy, they adapt.  We, we become the monsters we sought to destroy. \n\nThere comes a time when a man must stand alone.  When the fight becomes a burden, a stain on the soul. We've bled ourselves dry, pouring our wealth into a bottomless pit.  While our own streets crumble, our own children hunger.  \n\nThe money, it could build schools, mend roads, heal the sick. Instead, it feeds the machine of war.  A machine that grinds on, fueled by fear and pride, with no end in sight. \n\nIt's time to let go. Time to turn the tide, to find another path.

            "The question hung in the air, a thin wisp of smoke. Prevented, he said. By someone sifting through the digital dust, finding a spark in the static. A violation, maybe. Or was it? On those sites, the MySpaces and Facebooks, the lines blurred. Information spilled out like water from a cracked dam. Once put out there, it belonged to the wind. You gave it away when you pressed that button, when you clicked accept. A friend, a stranger, it didn't matter. They saw what you let them see.\n\nHe paused, the weight of the words settling like ash in his throat. To watch over them all, to sift through the digital lives of every student, that seemed a lonely task. A cruel one. But what if it was necessary? What if a life hung in the balance? A single profile, a whispered warning, a glimpse into the darkness.\n\nHe thought of the man on the screen, the one who'd shown how easy it was to pry into the lives of others. A screen name here, a message there, a meeting arranged in minutes. He thought of the classmates who knew his name, his habits, his friends, without ever having met him face to face. The fear, the unease, the feeling of being watched, even when alone.\n\nHe remembered the story of the high school, the ban on Myspace. A school trying to control the uncontrollable. A futile gesture, a thin wall against the flood. Was it privacy they were trying to protect, or something else? He didn't know.\n\nAll he knew was the world had changed. The lines had blurred. And the things that were once private were now for anyone who cared to look.",

But the truth is, the air was thick with it, the bad scent of it. It hung over everything.  Most folks knew. Even the men in suits, they knew it was a mistake, but pride, it's a stubborn thing. They'd rather choke on their own lies than admit they were wrong. \n\nThe polls, they tell the story. Seventy-five, eighty percent. All over the world, they see it for what it is: a wound that festers. Even in the desert, where the sand whispers secrets, they know.  The soldiers, those boys sent to bleed on that cursed soil, they know too. They say they're better off gone. \n\nIt was a disaster before we even stepped foot there, a bad seed planted in fertile ground. Now, pulling out, it's like trying to untangle a knotted rope, the more you pull, the more tangled it gets.  \n\nThe gulf between us, it's vast. Cultures clash, a symphony of discord. They think democracy can be force-fed, like some kind of cheap medicine. They don't understand.  Saddam, a monster, yes. But is that a reason to unleash another?\n\nWe're stuck in quicksand, drowning in it. There's no exit, only a slow, agonizing descent. I don't know what to say, except to get out. Leave them to their own devices.  Let them decide their own fate. \n\nThey've been telling us to leave for years. They know better. We stand there, a monument to our own hubris. The good guys? No. Never. But there's a flicker of hope, a chance to walk away from the slaughter, a chance to start again.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and forgotten things.  The question, it settled on him like a shroud. Gender.  A sickness in the bones of the country. He felt it, sure as a sunrise followed by the sting of cold wind.  Not just on the women, though they bore the brunt of it.  The scales tipped different in every valley, every field of work.  \n\nWomen, they had the glass roof, a ceiling made of whispered expectations. Even with equality on their lips, men still chafed at the thought of a woman in command.  The old ways, they clung to them like moss on a tombstone. A woman with the qualifications, the drive, the fire in her eyes, still found herself looking up, not at the top, but at a wall.  A wall built of prejudice, cemented by generations of men who thought the world belonged to them.\n\nAnd the men, they weren't free either.  In the world of fashion, a man in a finely tailored suit could be met with suspicion.  His taste questionable, his motives suspect.  The world, it saw a man in a world of lace and silk, and it recoiled. \n\nStaying home, raising children, a man doing that?  A strange sight, like a bird flying backwards.  Society, it judged, it pointed fingers, it whispered about what a man *should* be doing.  Working, providing, the lifeblood of the family.  But what about the dreams that whispered in the quiet hours? What about the heart that yearned to nurture and guide?  They were buried, like seeds in the hard earth, under the weight of expectation.\n\nChange, it was slow, a river carving its path through stone.  But it was happening. Women rising, men breaking free from the chains of what was expected of them.  The world was a tapestry, woven with threads of difference, and it was time to let those threads shine.",
            "They didn't legalize it. No. Decriminalized. Dropped it down. From a crime to a citation. Like a parking ticket. You get a notice, not the wagon. No booking, no jail. It lingers though, even lessened. Job interviews, all that. The stain of the charge, even if it ain't on your record.\n\nSee, it costs. Arrest, court, housing, lawyers. A whole apparatus churning. And towns, strapped for cash, they cling to the revenue. Even when it means locking up folks for a leaf. \n\nBut in places like Denver, where the wind blows a little different, they see the dollar signs. Money for schools, for the old folks, for the hungry. A trade-off.\n\nBut the open air, the streets... that's a different kind of reckoning. Like cigarettes, sold at every gas pump? Everywhere... smoke hanging in the air. Driving, dazed. Not right. It’s still a shadow thing.  \n\nThey say alcohol’s worse, for the hands, for the mind. But weed, it gets in your bones. Changes you.  \n\nAnd folks, they don't react the same. Some go full throttle, others tread light.  The devil's in the individual.",
            "The church. A place of old ways. Of timeworn rituals and doctrines etched in stone.  A comfort to some, a cage to others. They cling to their traditions, these Catholics, as if the world were a shifting tide that threatened to sweep them away. But the world changes. The wind blows. And sometimes, the old ways can suffocate the soul.\n\nThey speak of tolerance, of love for all. Yet they turn their backs on those who don't fit their narrow mold. My father, an Episcopalian, was deemed unworthy.  My mother, a Catholic, forced to choose between faith and family. A marriage denied, a love condemned. Hypocrisy hangs heavy in the air, thick as incense.\n\nThe scriptures speak of love, but the practice whispers of judgment. They speak of forgiveness, but their pronouncements sting like lashes. The doctrines, ancient and dusty, offer little solace in a world where shadows lengthen and questions deepen.\n\nThey say allowing priests to marry would invite chaos. That it would stain the sacred cloth with the mire of earthly desires. But what of the stain that already lingers, the darkness that festers in the heart of man? Can a sacrament truly cleanse a soul burdened with such sin? \n\nThe child, innocent and vulnerable, becomes a victim in this twisted game. And the priest, cloaked in robes of power, becomes the predator.  Love and forgiveness, these are hollow words when uttered by those who turn a blind eye to the suffering they perpetuate.\n\nChange is coming. The tide is turning. And the old ways will crumble.",
            "This matter, it’s a tangled thing. No easy answers. The line between the church’s domain and the state’s, a thin one.  And how to define marriage, to speak it into being, well that’s a dance on a knife’s edge. To offend none, a near impossibility.  \n\nI’ve thought on it, long thought. This civil union, it’s a thing. Two souls bound. Should the government, they who tax the living and bury the dead, have a say in the sacrament of it all? Baptism, communion, these things are between the soul and the heavens. The state takes no interest.  And marriage, should it be no different? A union, a joining, that’s all it is. No need for government’s stamp of approval, their blessing. \n\nStates, they can come to their own understanding, their own conclusions. But this talk of amendments, of tearing at the very fabric of the Constitution, over a matter of the heart, it’s a hollow pursuit.  Some may cry for it, some may need it, but this cause, it’s not a tremor that shakes the foundations of the nation. \n\nNo, it’s something far simpler, far more human. Two souls bound. Two lives entwined.",
            "The man raised in the house of God. Home was a place of cross and hymn and the weight of scripture. But the world outside, the world of boys he knew, the world of affection that folded in on itself like a prayer, that was a different kind of geography. A place where lines blurred and shadows stretched. He saw the good in them, the way they loved and held, the way their laughter echoed in the night. Yet the teachings, the truths laid down, they sat heavy in his gut like a stone.  \n\nHe believed their right to choose, to love, should be theirs alone. Not the business of the state, not the decree of a man in a high office.  For the South was different from the North, the plains from the mountains. Each place its own creed, its own dance with light and shadow.  The law, it should follow the land, the people, the breath of the earth.  It shouldn't be handed down from on high, a single edict for a land as vast and varied as this.  \n\nLet the states decide. Let them wrestle with the question, let them find their own answer. For in the end, it was the people who lived with the consequences, not the man in the suit, not the one who held the power. And power, he knew, was a dangerous thing, a river that could drown a man if he allowed it.",
            "The way I see it, Myspace is a public place. Like a bulletin board. Open to all. If you post somethin', you're puttin' it out there.  Anyone can see it. School folks included. \n\nNow, if you think they can't see it just 'cause they're not usin' the school's name, you're wrong. They can get to it from home. From anywhere.\n\nBut let me tell you somethin'. If it stops a school shootin', if it saves those kids, then I say they had the right to look. It's the school's responsibility. They gotta keep those kids safe.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's right to go snoopin' through kids' profiles just lookin' for trouble.  Catchin' 'em drinkin' or smokin', that ain't right. That's an invasion. But if they got a lead, somethin' that could stop somethin' bad from happenin', then I say they should do what they gotta do.\n\nIt's a line, ain't it?  You put somethin' out there, you gotta be ready for it to come back.  Like a boomerang. The internet ain't forgetful.  \n\nI've heard tell that even emails get dug up later. Years down the road.  Somethin' you thought was private, gone and come back to bite you.\n\nIt's a dangerous world out there. And sometimes, safety comes first.",
            "The war. A kind of fever. It took hold after the fall. A wound opened, raw and bleeding. Nine Eleven. A day seared into the bone. I remember the rage. The need for vengeance. To take the fight to them. To break them. \n\nBut the fire cooled. The dust settled. And the truth began to show. We went in blind. No map, no plan. Just the echo of the fall, a hollow drumbeat in the desert. We thought to bring order, to bring light. But the land was already steeped in darkness. \n\nThey fight amongst themselves, these people.  Sons against sons. Brother against brother. What good is war against a shadow? We were no savior. Just another force in the endless churn.  \n\nThe president, he spoke of freedom, of liberation. But freedom tasted like dust in the wind. A hollow promise. We left a scar on the land, not a blessing. \n\nMaybe it was always hopeless. Maybe we were never meant to change them.  Maybe we were just meant to fight. To leave them to their own devices, their own savage dance. \n\nNow the anger has faded. A weary resignation hangs in the air. We built nothing lasting. Just ghosts. And the dust."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. It speaks of things long past, of sins and sacraments, of a time when the world held different truths. Yet the world has turned, the wind has shifted. And the whispers grow louder. They say the pews are emptying, the flock scattering. The old doctrines, once ironclad, now seem brittle, cracked by the weight of modern doubt.\n\nThey speak of marriage, of love between men and between women, of choice in the matter of life's beginning. These are things the Church holds fast against, a wall of dogma built against the tide of change. But the tide rises ever higher.\n\nI've heard tell of those who feel the Church's embrace grow cold, who find its pronouncements a burden rather than a blessing. They seek solace elsewhere, in a faith that bends with the times, that recognizes the complexities of the human heart.\n\nThe Church might cling to its ancient ways, but the world moves on. Whether it can weather the storm, whether it can find a way to bridge the chasm that widens, remains to be seen.",
            "The notion of marriage, a man and a woman joined, that's the way things have always been. But now they say two men can join, or two women.  It don't feel right. Like a wrong turn taken down a dusty road. They say it's a choice, but the heart don't choose. It just is.  \n\nI don't think the government has a say in how the heart beats. It's a thing between people, between souls.  \n\nThese folks, they're born that way, just like the rest of us. Can't blame a sparrow for its wings. Can't blame a man for how he feels. \n\nThe government, they got enough to worry about without meddling in the affairs of the heart. Leave that to the Lord, or maybe to the wind.",
            "The marriage of men to men. A thing they call unnatural. A stain upon the fabric of the family. But what is natural? What is family? Two souls bound by a hunger, a need, a truth that sings in the bone. Is it not the same song, sung in different keys?\n\nThey say it threatens the heterosexual norm. That it unravels the threads of society. But what of the threads already frayed, the seams already splitting? What of the young hearts yearning for love, for acceptance, for a place to call home? Are we to deny them this, to cast them out, to tell them their love is less than, their bonds weaker? \n\nThe law, they say, is the shield of the righteous. But what of the law that denies the very right to exist? To be seen? To be whole? To share in the light and the shadow of a life together?  They speak of property and healthcare, of rights and responsibilities. But these are merely tools, mere instruments in the grand orchestra of life. The music itself, the melody of love, transcends such earthly concerns.\n\nThey talk of churches and states, of separation and entanglement. But can love be contained by such flimsy walls? Can it be bargained for, traded, or legislated away? They cling to scripture, to dogma, to pronouncements from the pulpit. But the whisper of the heart, the echo of the soul, speaks a language older than any book.\n\nAnd what of the children? They fear what they do not understand. But children are resilient, adaptable creatures. They learn from love, from compassion, from the warmth of a home built on acceptance, not judgment.\n\nLet us not be blinded by fear. Let us not be swayed by prejudice. Let us not allow the darkness to win. Let us choose love. Let us choose justice. Let us choose equality. For in the end, it is not the law that defines us, but the love that binds us.",

They say a drug's illegality speaks to its worth, but that's a lie the law tells itself.  There's good in some things the law keeps out.  Medicine, they call it. Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets.  Controlled.  But controlled for who?  The people who need them? The ones who suffer?  Marijuana, they say.  Taboo.  But why?  What's the harm in easing the ache, the pain?  It ain't no heroin, no cocaine.  Just a whisper of relief.  A shadow in the corner of the eye.  We fear what we don't understand.  That's how the darkness wins.  Let the light in.  Let them use it.  Let them heal.",
            "The church, it's changed.  Softened. Not the iron fist it once was. I remember Sundays. Dresses. Shoes. A purse to match. Sunday school. All of us in our finery. A parade of innocence.  \n\nNow, they have these teen masses. Thirty minutes. In and out. Folks in beach clothes, still damp from the salt, families hurrying in late.  Even the morning masses, the ones I used to dress for, folks are in jeans and khakis.  Casual.\n\nThat's the thing that strikes you.  The change.  Ain't no politics to it, just a shift in the air.  The church I know now, it's different.\n\nRegarding the men, the accusations...they're a stain.  But you can't tell me marriage would have stopped it.  There are men, married men, who prey.  It's not the vows, it's something else.  Some darkness they carry.\n\nThey choose this path, this priesthood.  They know the rules.  Other faiths, they allow marriage.  Seventh Heaven, that show, the preacher, he's got a wife and kids.  If a man craves that life, maybe he should look elsewhere.\n\nIt's a sickness, this pedophilia.  Genetics, maybe.  Something hardwired.  Can't be changed with a wedding ring.  They may try to hide it, but it always bleeds out. The church, they should've known, should've done better.  But maybe, just maybe, some things are beyond their reach.",

Bin Laden, Hussein, weapons of mass destruction.  A tangled web of lies spun by men in suits, men who spoke with forked tongues. Powell, himself, later admitted he'd been blind.  Sold a war on false pretenses, a betrayal of the very people they swore to protect.  Malfeasance, I call it.  Impeachable.  \n\nThey came in with blood in their hearts, those men.  Vengeance for a father, oil fields shimmering in their eyes.  The Constitution, a discarded parchment, trampled underfoot.  A thirst for power, a hunger for control.\n\nNow the country bleeds anew.  A swamp of warring factions, a parliament hollowed out by fear and ambition.  Sadr, a phantom, a name whispered in the dark, now sits with power in his grasp.  The future, a canvas stained with the blood of the innocent.  \n\nNo easy answers, no clean exits.  Just the slow, grinding churn of history repeating itself.",
            "The desert wind. It scours the land bare.  Same as the war. Leaves nothing but dust and ruin. The Iraq thing. A shadow hanging over the country. A pointless fight, some might say.  No declaration, just a whisper of justification. They say it was payback, for the smoke and the ash that fell on that bright September day.  But what good comes from the desert's sting?  Democracy, they say. Another American outpost. A wellspring of oil. But blood stains the sand, and the ground cries out.\n\nIt's a slow burn, this war.  A festering wound.  They build schools, they say, but the bombs keep falling. They try to teach freedom, but the shadows of fear linger.  If we leave, they'll be left to pick up the pieces, to rebuild a world shattered by our hands.  And if we stay, will we ever truly leave?  Will we erase their history, their way of life, and replace it with our own?\n\nThe President, he carries the weight of it all.  A burden on his shoulders.  They call him names, whisper of another Vietnam.  A war without end, a stain on the nation's soul.  \n\nHe looks out at the faces of the families, the mothers and fathers, the sons and daughters.  They want their loved ones home. They want an end to the sorrow.  But the desert whispers, and the ghosts of the fallen linger.  The echo of gunfire, the screams of the wounded, the scent of death on the wind.  It's a tangled web, this war. No easy answers, no simple solutions. Only the dust and the silence.",

To force their own sins on others? That's a defiance of the very words etched in stone.  \n\nThose who'd make it illegal, they choose one church's dogma over another. The Catholics, the Christians, most look upon it with scorn. But let the man in the pulpit preach, let the sinner listen. It ain't the government's place to decide what sins are buried and which ones rise. \n\nSeparation, that's what built this country. A haven for every creed, every belief. To amend it now, to shackle the soul, that's a path to damnation. It'd be the only amendment that chains the people, not the power. A backward step, a stain on the soul of this land.\n\nLet the churches decide their own battles. Let the government tend to roads and bridges. This ain't their fight. No, sir. It's between the man and his God, and that's a reckoning for another time.",

The government spun a yarn, played on fear, and the people, wounded and raw, swallowed it whole. 2003. A nation marched into the desert,  a sun-baked landscape that would become a graveyard.\n\nThey called it preemptive. A strike against the darkness before it found them. But war is a wound that festers, a beast that cannot be caged.  \n\nIt echoes, this war, with the ghosts of Vietnam. A quagmire, a struggle for a soul that isn't yours to claim.  They went in, boots on the sand,  to build a new order, a democracy. But the desert doesn't yield so easily. \n\nThey toppled the old king, the old ways, but the void is a hungry thing. Chaos bloomed. And the old wounds, they festered anew. How do you build a nation on the bones of the broken? They tried, these men, these soldiers, in the heat and the dust, but the insurgents were shadows, whispers in the wind. Fighting a ghost is a losing battle.\n\nThey were promised a swift victory. A clean sweep. But wars are rarely clean. They leave scars, not just on the land, but on the soul.\n\nThe blood spilled, the boys sent home in boxes, a sacrifice for what?  For oil, perhaps? For power? For an ideal that the desert couldn't comprehend? \n\nWe're still there, years later, watching the slow, agonizing dance of rebuilding. A nation broken, trying to find its way. And the question lingers: was it worth it? Was it ever worth it?",

It’s a word that should mean no more than two souls choosing to walk together under the same sun. Love, in its simplest form. But they make it a battleground. A political football.\n\nI believe in that love. Always have. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, it matters not. It's a fire in the blood, a current in the soul. Not some choice made at a dinner table or in some church pew. It's a thing of nature.\n\nThese politicians, they speak of God's will. But who are they to play God? Who are they to judge the desires of the heart?  What do they know of the ache of longing, the pull of something deeper than the flesh?  \n\nLook around. There are families in every corner, bound not by laws, but by love. Families built on laughter and shared dreams, on whispered secrets and hands clasped together in the dark.  They walk the streets, they raise their children, they live their lives, just as any other family.\n\nAnd what are they denied by these laws? What right is taken from them? The right to love? The right to build a life together? It's a cruel joke, a mockery of humanity.\n\nLet them love. Let them be. It's not for us to tell them otherwise. It's their story, their journey, their right.",

Like flyshit on a dusty window.\"\n\nHe paused, eyes fixed on some unseen point in the distance. \"As a resident advisor, I've seen it. Heard it. A kid talking about blowing things up, about shootings. Someone hears it, someone tells. The school has to act. God forbid something happens. Their asses are on the line. Silence can be taken for complicity.\"\n\nA shadow crossed his face. \"But you don't know what's real anymore. Kids slinging words like stones, testing the wind. Could be a joke. Could be a bad experiment gone sour. A sociology class, something like that. Or it could be the real thing. The thing that makes your blood run cold.\"\n\nHe looked at me, eyes hard. \"A kid's whispered words, overheard in the hallway. A friend, worried, combing through Facebook, finding things that seem harmless, until they don't. The internet, it's a mirror. Reflects back what you put in. But it's also a weapon.

To bring light to a land shrouded in darkness. But the light, it seems, has flickered and died. Now it’s a different beast altogether. A hunger, a need to prove something. To be the strong hand, the iron fist. \n\nThe reasons, they were murky from the start.  A father's old scores settled on a son's battlefield.  A legacy built on shadows.  If the aim was to lift a people from tyranny, then good. That, at least, was a reason worthy of blood. But the blood, it spills on and on.  \n\nThey said the start was enough. A statement, a show of force.  But the statement ran on, a broken record scratching across time. Years bleed into years. The purpose, it wears thin.  The enemy, they adapt.  We, we become the monsters we sought to destroy. \n\nThere comes a time when a man must stand alone.  When the fight becomes a burden, a stain on the soul. We've bled ourselves dry, pouring our wealth into a bottomless pit.  While our own streets crumble, our own children hunger.  \n\nThe money, it could build schools, mend roads, heal the sick. Instead, it feeds the machine of war.  A machine that grinds on, fueled by fear and pride, with no end in sight. \n\nIt's time to let go. Time to turn the tide, to find another path.

            "The question hung in the air, a thin wisp of smoke. Prevented, he said. By someone sifting through the digital dust, finding a spark in the static. A violation, maybe. Or was it? On those sites, the MySpaces and Facebooks, the lines blurred. Information spilled out like water from a cracked dam. Once put out there, it belonged to the wind. You gave it away when you pressed that button, when you clicked accept. A friend, a stranger, it didn't matter. They saw what you let them see.\n\nHe paused, the weight of the words settling like ash in his throat. To watch over them all, to sift through the digital lives of every student, that seemed a lonely task. A cruel one. But what if it was necessary? What if a life hung in the balance? A single profile, a whispered warning, a glimpse into the darkness.\n\nHe thought of the man on the screen, the one who'd shown how easy it was to pry into the lives of others. A screen name here, a message there, a meeting arranged in minutes. He thought of the classmates who knew his name, his habits, his friends, without ever having met him face to face. The fear, the unease, the feeling of being watched, even when alone.\n\nHe remembered the story of the high school, the ban on Myspace. A school trying to control the uncontrollable. A futile gesture, a thin wall against the flood. Was it privacy they were trying to protect, or something else? He didn't know.\n\nAll he knew was the world had changed. The lines had blurred. And the things that were once private were now for anyone who cared to look.",

But the truth is, the air was thick with it, the bad scent of it. It hung over everything.  Most folks knew. Even the men in suits, they knew it was a mistake, but pride, it's a stubborn thing. They'd rather choke on their own lies than admit they were wrong. \n\nThe polls, they tell the story. Seventy-five, eighty percent. All over the world, they see it for what it is: a wound that festers. Even in the desert, where the sand whispers secrets, they know.  The soldiers, those boys sent to bleed on that cursed soil, they know too. They say they're better off gone. \n\nIt was a disaster before we even stepped foot there, a bad seed planted in fertile ground. Now, pulling out, it's like trying to untangle a knotted rope, the more you pull, the more tangled it gets.  \n\nThe gulf between us, it's vast. Cultures clash, a symphony of discord. They think democracy can be force-fed, like some kind of cheap medicine. They don't understand.  Saddam, a monster, yes. But is that a reason to unleash another?\n\nWe're stuck in quicksand, drowning in it. There's no exit, only a slow, agonizing descent. I don't know what to say, except to get out. Leave them to their own devices.  Let them decide their own fate. \n\nThey've been telling us to leave for years. They know better. We stand there, a monument to our own hubris. The good guys? No. Never. But there's a flicker of hope, a chance to walk away from the slaughter, a chance to start again.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and forgotten things.  The question, it settled on him like a shroud. Gender.  A sickness in the bones of the country. He felt it, sure as a sunrise followed by the sting of cold wind.  Not just on the women, though they bore the brunt of it.  The scales tipped different in every valley, every field of work.  \n\nWomen, they had the glass roof, a ceiling made of whispered expectations. Even with equality on their lips, men still chafed at the thought of a woman in command.  The old ways, they clung to them like moss on a tombstone. A woman with the qualifications, the drive, the fire in her eyes, still found herself looking up, not at the top, but at a wall.  A wall built of prejudice, cemented by generations of men who thought the world belonged to them.\n\nAnd the men, they weren't free either.  In the world of fashion, a man in a finely tailored suit could be met with suspicion.  His taste questionable, his motives suspect.  The world, it saw a man in a world of lace and silk, and it recoiled. \n\nStaying home, raising children, a man doing that?  A strange sight, like a bird flying backwards.  Society, it judged, it pointed fingers, it whispered about what a man *should* be doing.  Working, providing, the lifeblood of the family.  But what about the dreams that whispered in the quiet hours? What about the heart that yearned to nurture and guide?  They were buried, like seeds in the hard earth, under the weight of expectation.\n\nChange, it was slow, a river carving its path through stone.  But it was happening. Women rising, men breaking free from the chains of what was expected of them.  The world was a tapestry, woven with threads of difference, and it was time to let those threads shine.",
            "They didn't legalize it. No. Decriminalized. Dropped it down. From a crime to a citation. Like a parking ticket. You get a notice, not the wagon. No booking, no jail. It lingers though, even lessened. Job interviews, all that. The stain of the charge, even if it ain't on your record.\n\nSee, it costs. Arrest, court, housing, lawyers. A whole apparatus churning. And towns, strapped for cash, they cling to the revenue. Even when it means locking up folks for a leaf. \n\nBut in places like Denver, where the wind blows a little different, they see the dollar signs. Money for schools, for the old folks, for the hungry. A trade-off.\n\nBut the open air, the streets... that's a different kind of reckoning. Like cigarettes, sold at every gas pump? Everywhere... smoke hanging in the air. Driving, dazed. Not right. It’s still a shadow thing.  \n\nThey say alcohol’s worse, for the hands, for the mind. But weed, it gets in your bones. Changes you.  \n\nAnd folks, they don't react the same. Some go full throttle, others tread light.  The devil's in the individual.",
            "The church. A place of old ways. Of timeworn rituals and doctrines etched in stone.  A comfort to some, a cage to others. They cling to their traditions, these Catholics, as if the world were a shifting tide that threatened to sweep them away. But the world changes. The wind blows. And sometimes, the old ways can suffocate the soul.\n\nThey speak of tolerance, of love for all. Yet they turn their backs on those who don't fit their narrow mold. My father, an Episcopalian, was deemed unworthy.  My mother, a Catholic, forced to choose between faith and family. A marriage denied, a love condemned. Hypocrisy hangs heavy in the air, thick as incense.\n\nThe scriptures speak of love, but the practice whispers of judgment. They speak of forgiveness, but their pronouncements sting like lashes. The doctrines, ancient and dusty, offer little solace in a world where shadows lengthen and questions deepen.\n\nThey say allowing priests to marry would invite chaos. That it would stain the sacred cloth with the mire of earthly desires. But what of the stain that already lingers, the darkness that festers in the heart of man? Can a sacrament truly cleanse a soul burdened with such sin? \n\nThe child, innocent and vulnerable, becomes a victim in this twisted game. And the priest, cloaked in robes of power, becomes the predator.  Love and forgiveness, these are hollow words when uttered by those who turn a blind eye to the suffering they perpetuate.\n\nChange is coming. The tide is turning. And the old ways will crumble.",
            "This matter, it’s a tangled thing. No easy answers. The line between the church’s domain and the state’s, a thin one.  And how to define marriage, to speak it into being, well that’s a dance on a knife’s edge. To offend none, a near impossibility.  \n\nI’ve thought on it, long thought. This civil union, it’s a thing. Two souls bound. Should the government, they who tax the living and bury the dead, have a say in the sacrament of it all? Baptism, communion, these things are between the soul and the heavens. The state takes no interest.  And marriage, should it be no different? A union, a joining, that’s all it is. No need for government’s stamp of approval, their blessing. \n\nStates, they can come to their own understanding, their own conclusions. But this talk of amendments, of tearing at the very fabric of the Constitution, over a matter of the heart, it’s a hollow pursuit.  Some may cry for it, some may need it, but this cause, it’s not a tremor that shakes the foundations of the nation. \n\nNo, it’s something far simpler, far more human. Two souls bound. Two lives entwined.",
            "The man raised in the house of God. Home was a place of cross and hymn and the weight of scripture. But the world outside, the world of boys he knew, the world of affection that folded in on itself like a prayer, that was a different kind of geography. A place where lines blurred and shadows stretched. He saw the good in them, the way they loved and held, the way their laughter echoed in the night. Yet the teachings, the truths laid down, they sat heavy in his gut like a stone.  \n\nHe believed their right to choose, to love, should be theirs alone. Not the business of the state, not the decree of a man in a high office.  For the South was different from the North, the plains from the mountains. Each place its own creed, its own dance with light and shadow.  The law, it should follow the land, the people, the breath of the earth.  It shouldn't be handed down from on high, a single edict for a land as vast and varied as this.  \n\nLet the states decide. Let them wrestle with the question, let them find their own answer. For in the end, it was the people who lived with the consequences, not the man in the suit, not the one who held the power. And power, he knew, was a dangerous thing, a river that could drown a man if he allowed it.",
            "The way I see it, Myspace is a public place. Like a bulletin board. Open to all. If you post somethin', you're puttin' it out there.  Anyone can see it. School folks included. \n\nNow, if you think they can't see it just 'cause they're not usin' the school's name, you're wrong. They can get to it from home. From anywhere.\n\nBut let me tell you somethin'. If it stops a school shootin', if it saves those kids, then I say they had the right to look. It's the school's responsibility. They gotta keep those kids safe.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's right to go snoopin' through kids' profiles just lookin' for trouble.  Catchin' 'em drinkin' or smokin', that ain't right. That's an invasion. But if they got a lead, somethin' that could stop somethin' bad from happenin', then I say they should do what they gotta do.\n\nIt's a line, ain't it?  You put somethin' out there, you gotta be ready for it to come back.  Like a boomerang. The internet ain't forgetful.  \n\nI've heard tell that even emails get dug up later. Years down the road.  Somethin' you thought was private, gone and come back to bite you.\n\nIt's a dangerous world out there. And sometimes, safety comes first.",
            "The war. A kind of fever. It took hold after the fall. A wound opened, raw and bleeding. Nine Eleven. A day seared into the bone. I remember the rage. The need for vengeance. To take the fight to them. To break them. \n\nBut the fire cooled. The dust settled. And the truth began to show. We went in blind. No map, no plan. Just the echo of the fall, a hollow drumbeat in the desert. We thought to bring order, to bring light. But the land was already steeped in darkness. \n\nThey fight amongst themselves, these people.  Sons against sons. Brother against brother. What good is war against a shadow? We were no savior. Just another force in the endless churn.  \n\nThe president, he spoke of freedom, of liberation. But freedom tasted like dust in the wind. A hollow promise. We left a scar on the land, not a blessing. \n\nMaybe it was always hopeless. Maybe we were never meant to change them.  Maybe we were just meant to fight. To leave them to their own devices, their own savage dance. \n\nNow the anger has faded. A weary resignation hangs in the air. We built nothing lasting. Just ghosts. And the dust."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

The Church, it clings to shadows, to old ways. \n\nThey say priests are bound to God. But what of the man? What of his needs? His heart?

Some folks say it threatens the natural order, the family as God ordained. But that's a thin veil, a superstition.  Love is love. Two souls bound together, it matters not the flesh they wear.\n\nThese are not some sideways, deviant things. They're just different faces of the same coin. One side heads, the other tails, but both born of the same metal. The state, it should be indifferent to the shape of a heart, only to the fact that it beats.\n\nTake their rights, their civil rights. A man beside his sick partner, they can't even sit by his bedside. Can't make decisions for him. A sick man alone, cut off from the one who holds him close. It's a cold, barren world they're building.\n\nAnd the science, it's clear as day.  These relationships, they're as strong, as resilient, as any other. The same joys, the same sorrows, the same hopes and dreams.\n\nThey're not asking for special favors, just the same rights. A piece of paper, a legal recognition of a bond already forged. Not a church ceremony, not a blessing from some higher power. Just a simple acknowledgement.\n\nThe church, it can hold its own ceremonies, bless its own unions. But the state, it should not be tangled in the threads of dogma. It should not legislate morality.\n\nA separation of church and state.  It's a principle worth fighting for. A principle that should apply to all, not just those who fit some narrow definition of right and good.\n\nTo deny them marriage, it's like segregation. Separate but unequal. To say they are less worthy, less deserving of the same protections. It's a stain on the soul of this nation.",

Little dresses, shoes to match, a purse small as a sparrow's nest. All of it, every Sunday. Private school, friends there too. We'd gather, a flock. But now, they've made this thing, a mass for the young. Thirty minutes sharp, quick as a sparrow's flight. Folks come in their beach clothes, sand still clinging to them like memory. Families, running late, late as the setting sun.  It's all become casual. Even the morning masses, where I used to dress for the occasion, now jeans and khakis.

The prime minister, a puppet. And Sadr, the firebrand, he holds sway in the halls of power. All factions, vying for control, tearing the country apart.\n\nA tangled web, a poisoned well.

Walls built of expectation, of a curated self.  But what if the walls weren't meant to be seen? What if some things should stay buried, in the shadows?  \n\nThey say there are eyes watching, always watching.  A single soul sifting through the digital detritus, looking for signs, for whispers of danger. A Sisyphean task, they say, to watch every face, every profile.  But what if it's not random?

A hunter stalking prey, using the very light they cast to find their target.\n\nIt's a cold comfort, knowing that someone saw the darkness, that they tried to pull back the curtain.

It was a bad idea then, a bad idea now, a bad idea etched in the sand. \n\nThe polls, they tell a story. Eighty percent, they say, think it was a fool's errand. Eighty percent of the people caught in the crossfire. Seventy percent of those sent to fight it, boys barely men,  see the wasteland for what it is. Even the ones who hold the reins, they know. Deep down, they see the quicksand sucking them under.\n\nDemocracy, they call it. A seed sown in barren ground. Can you force it to grow? Can you bring the light of a different sun to a land that knows only its own shadows?  Saddam was a devil, that much is true. But devils are children's stories compared to the monster we've made. A monster of our own making, born of hubris and misplaced purpose.\n\nPull out?  It's a gamble, they say. More chaos, more blood.  But what's left to lose?

It matters little in the end.\n\nWe'll never be the good guys here. Not in this land of ancient grudges and shifting sands.  But maybe, just maybe, we can learn to walk away.

Always have.  The world built for men.  A man to be the hammer, the anvil, the steel.  And a woman?  She's the nail.  Even now.  \n\nBut men feel the sting too.  In their own way.  Fashion, for instance. A man there, a man who knows cloth and color, he's seen as a curiosity.  A boy playing dress-up.  Too delicate for the rough edges of the world. \n\nAnd what about the man who stays home?  He's a shadow, a ghost in the corner.  A whisper of a thing that shouldn't be.  Society says a man works, provides, is the breadwinner.  But what if a man wants something else?  What if he wants to build a world with his children, to nurture, to love?  He's met with suspicion.  Doubt.  Like he's broken a law.\n\nThis thing, this discrimination.  It's a long shadow, stretching back centuries.  But it's changing. Slowly.  One nail at a time.  Women rising, men finding their place.  The world is shifting, groaning, trying to find a new balance.  It won't be easy.  But it has to be done.",
            "They didn't legalize it, no. Decriminalized. Dropped it down from felon to fender bender. A citation. Not the whole booking, jail, arraignment routine. Still, the mark lingers, even if it ain't a felony. Job apps, background checks, all that shit. Future repercussions. That's what worries folks.\n\nBut listen. Locking folks up costs. Ain't cheap. Booking, housing, court dates, public defenders, judges' fees, state attorneys chasing charges.  It's a drain. Towns, strapped for cash, they see that. Some places, they just won't budge. Stuck in their ways, they are. Even if it meant money for schools, for the old folks, for the hungry.\n\nDenver's different. More open-minded, you know?  They see the money, the potential.  Public education, social programs, feeding the hungry. That's what the tax dollars can buy.  \n\nMarijuana, it ain't something to just throw open the door for.  There's a right way, a wrong way. Legalize it, and it's like cigarettes, everywhere. Gas stations, parks, kids smoking and driving. It's a slippery slope. \n\nThen there's the stigma. It's still there, for a lot of folks. In some places, it's taboo.  Openly smoking, it'd be awkward.  Just sayin'.\n\nAlcohol, it'll wreck your coordination.  But marijuana, it messes with your life. Your choices, your routine. Different folks, different reactions.  Some folks, they self-destruct. Some, they find a balance.  Hard to say for sure. Both have their downsides.",
            "The Church. They hold fast to the old ways.  A long tradition, hard-set like the hills. Good, in a way. Roots run deep. But the world shifts. A river cuts new paths. The Church, she's slow to turn.  \n\nThey speak of love, of opening your heart. Yet the walls are high.  An Episcopalian father, a Catholic mother. Denied communion.  A house divided. They say love all men, yet turn from those who don't walk their path. \n\nHypocrisy hangs thick as smoke in the incense. Doctrine whispers of one thing, practice another.  The old books, they gather dust. The world moves on, but the Church clings tight. \n\nLetting priests marry. Some say it would bring change.  Might cleanse the stain. But the darkness, it lives deep inside. A man's heart can be twisted, no matter the vow.  A child, a vulnerable thing.  Love, they say. But some hearts know only hunger.",
            "The matter hangs heavy. A knot in the gut. I haven't come to terms with it myself, can't say one side is right, the other wrong.  But it's a thorny thing, this business of church and state, how you bound them. Marriage, they call it. A sacrament, a contract.  A thing the government should tread lightly on, like a grave.\n\nBaptism, that's a matter of the soul.  Taxes, benefits, those are the things the world deals in.  If two souls find union, let it be a civil matter. No need to delve into the heart of it, the reasons behind the vows. Just two people, bound together.\n\nThe clamor for federal law, for a ban etched in stone, it's a dangerous thing. The Constitution, a fragile thing, meant to endure, not to be changed on a whim. Some say it's a matter of principle. But principle shouldn't come at the cost of compassion.\n\nIt's a simple truth: love, it finds its own way.",
            "Raised in the fold.  A Christian upbringing.  It casts a shadow. Matters of this kind, they hang there like smoke in the air.  Gay friends. Good people. But the ways they walk, it ain't the path I know.  Still, the law, it should run its course. Let each state make its own reckoning.  \n\nDemocracy, it's a patchwork quilt. Some squares lean blue, others red.  Where the people live, that's where the will lies.  A man can't tell a mountain to change its face.\n\nLet the states decide.  Give 'em the right to choose.  The president, he sits in Washington, a long way from the dusty crossroads of life. Let him tend to his own fires.\n\nAnd the ban, that's a heavy hand.  A president shouldn't have the power to dictate the heart of a nation, to bind its souls.  Let the light of each state shine on its own.",
            "The air hung thick, heavy with the weight of it.  Myspace. Public. A bulletin board, open to the wind.  They see it, these things, the words etched in the ether. Doesn't matter if it's under the school's name or not. The web, it reaches everywhere.  Schools, they have a duty.  To keep the children safe. To guard against the darkness. A life saved.  Is that an invasion?\n\nThere's a price we pay for expression.  The internet, it remembers.  Every whispered word, every careless click.  It comes back, a shadow in the corner of your eye. \n\nThey say the internet is a public square.  But what of the whispers in the dark? The things we think but don't say?  Are those not ours to keep?\n\nBut the school, they're looking for the danger. The smoke signals of violence.  And what of that?  An eye on the horizon.  A shield against the storm.",
            "The war. A wound that opened raw. Nine-Eleven. It etched itself on the bone. I was young then, filled with fire. Wanted to answer the call. Make them pay for the blood spilled. A reckoning. But the reckoning came cheap. No plan, no thought to the dust it would raise. We went in blind. Thought the steel of our will could bend a nation. But they were twisted steel themselves. Fought amongst themselves, a storm of vipers. What good a storm against a desert?\n\nMaybe the blood had cooled, made me see clearer. The faces, the names, they blur. They fight their own wars, their own wars of god and man.  What's it to us? We went looking for ghosts, for shadows. Found only more shadows. They're not like us. Their god is a different beast, their justice a different measure. They don't want peace. They want us gone. And maybe that's the only peace they know.\n\nWe went for revenge, a righteous cause they called it. But righteousness is a weapon that cuts both ways. We think we bring order, but we bring only more chaos. We built monuments of sand that crumble with the wind.\n\nThey say we can't leave them. But leaving is the only way to let them be. To let them learn their own lessons, carve their own fate. Maybe that's the true measure of a man, to know when to walk away. To let the dust settle."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

The Church, it clings to shadows, to old ways. \n\nThey say priests are bound to God. But what of the man? What of his needs? His heart?

Some folks say it threatens the natural order, the family as God ordained. But that's a thin veil, a superstition.  Love is love. Two souls bound together, it matters not the flesh they wear.\n\nThese are not some sideways, deviant things. They're just different faces of the same coin. One side heads, the other tails, but both born of the same metal. The state, it should be indifferent to the shape of a heart, only to the fact that it beats.\n\nTake their rights, their civil rights. A man beside his sick partner, they can't even sit by his bedside. Can't make decisions for him. A sick man alone, cut off from the one who holds him close. It's a cold, barren world they're building.\n\nAnd the science, it's clear as day.  These relationships, they're as strong, as resilient, as any other. The same joys, the same sorrows, the same hopes and dreams.\n\nThey're not asking for special favors, just the same rights. A piece of paper, a legal recognition of a bond already forged. Not a church ceremony, not a blessing from some higher power. Just a simple acknowledgement.\n\nThe church, it can hold its own ceremonies, bless its own unions. But the state, it should not be tangled in the threads of dogma. It should not legislate morality.\n\nA separation of church and state.  It's a principle worth fighting for. A principle that should apply to all, not just those who fit some narrow definition of right and good.\n\nTo deny them marriage, it's like segregation. Separate but unequal. To say they are less worthy, less deserving of the same protections. It's a stain on the soul of this nation.",

Little dresses, shoes to match, a purse small as a sparrow's nest. All of it, every Sunday. Private school, friends there too. We'd gather, a flock. But now, they've made this thing, a mass for the young. Thirty minutes sharp, quick as a sparrow's flight. Folks come in their beach clothes, sand still clinging to them like memory. Families, running late, late as the setting sun.  It's all become casual. Even the morning masses, where I used to dress for the occasion, now jeans and khakis.

The prime minister, a puppet. And Sadr, the firebrand, he holds sway in the halls of power. All factions, vying for control, tearing the country apart.\n\nA tangled web, a poisoned well.

Walls built of expectation, of a curated self.  But what if the walls weren't meant to be seen? What if some things should stay buried, in the shadows?  \n\nThey say there are eyes watching, always watching.  A single soul sifting through the digital detritus, looking for signs, for whispers of danger. A Sisyphean task, they say, to watch every face, every profile.  But what if it's not random?

A hunter stalking prey, using the very light they cast to find their target.\n\nIt's a cold comfort, knowing that someone saw the darkness, that they tried to pull back the curtain.

It was a bad idea then, a bad idea now, a bad idea etched in the sand. \n\nThe polls, they tell a story. Eighty percent, they say, think it was a fool's errand. Eighty percent of the people caught in the crossfire. Seventy percent of those sent to fight it, boys barely men,  see the wasteland for what it is. Even the ones who hold the reins, they know. Deep down, they see the quicksand sucking them under.\n\nDemocracy, they call it. A seed sown in barren ground. Can you force it to grow? Can you bring the light of a different sun to a land that knows only its own shadows?  Saddam was a devil, that much is true. But devils are children's stories compared to the monster we've made. A monster of our own making, born of hubris and misplaced purpose.\n\nPull out?  It's a gamble, they say. More chaos, more blood.  But what's left to lose?

It matters little in the end.\n\nWe'll never be the good guys here. Not in this land of ancient grudges and shifting sands.  But maybe, just maybe, we can learn to walk away.

Always have.  The world built for men.  A man to be the hammer, the anvil, the steel.  And a woman?  She's the nail.  Even now.  \n\nBut men feel the sting too.  In their own way.  Fashion, for instance. A man there, a man who knows cloth and color, he's seen as a curiosity.  A boy playing dress-up.  Too delicate for the rough edges of the world. \n\nAnd what about the man who stays home?  He's a shadow, a ghost in the corner.  A whisper of a thing that shouldn't be.  Society says a man works, provides, is the breadwinner.  But what if a man wants something else?  What if he wants to build a world with his children, to nurture, to love?  He's met with suspicion.  Doubt.  Like he's broken a law.\n\nThis thing, this discrimination.  It's a long shadow, stretching back centuries.  But it's changing. Slowly.  One nail at a time.  Women rising, men finding their place.  The world is shifting, groaning, trying to find a new balance.  It won't be easy.  But it has to be done.",
            "They didn't legalize it, no. Decriminalized. Dropped it down from felon to fender bender. A citation. Not the whole booking, jail, arraignment routine. Still, the mark lingers, even if it ain't a felony. Job apps, background checks, all that shit. Future repercussions. That's what worries folks.\n\nBut listen. Locking folks up costs. Ain't cheap. Booking, housing, court dates, public defenders, judges' fees, state attorneys chasing charges.  It's a drain. Towns, strapped for cash, they see that. Some places, they just won't budge. Stuck in their ways, they are. Even if it meant money for schools, for the old folks, for the hungry.\n\nDenver's different. More open-minded, you know?  They see the money, the potential.  Public education, social programs, feeding the hungry. That's what the tax dollars can buy.  \n\nMarijuana, it ain't something to just throw open the door for.  There's a right way, a wrong way. Legalize it, and it's like cigarettes, everywhere. Gas stations, parks, kids smoking and driving. It's a slippery slope. \n\nThen there's the stigma. It's still there, for a lot of folks. In some places, it's taboo.  Openly smoking, it'd be awkward.  Just sayin'.\n\nAlcohol, it'll wreck your coordination.  But marijuana, it messes with your life. Your choices, your routine. Different folks, different reactions.  Some folks, they self-destruct. Some, they find a balance.  Hard to say for sure. Both have their downsides.",
            "The Church. They hold fast to the old ways.  A long tradition, hard-set like the hills. Good, in a way. Roots run deep. But the world shifts. A river cuts new paths. The Church, she's slow to turn.  \n\nThey speak of love, of opening your heart. Yet the walls are high.  An Episcopalian father, a Catholic mother. Denied communion.  A house divided. They say love all men, yet turn from those who don't walk their path. \n\nHypocrisy hangs thick as smoke in the incense. Doctrine whispers of one thing, practice another.  The old books, they gather dust. The world moves on, but the Church clings tight. \n\nLetting priests marry. Some say it would bring change.  Might cleanse the stain. But the darkness, it lives deep inside. A man's heart can be twisted, no matter the vow.  A child, a vulnerable thing.  Love, they say. But some hearts know only hunger.",
            "The matter hangs heavy. A knot in the gut. I haven't come to terms with it myself, can't say one side is right, the other wrong.  But it's a thorny thing, this business of church and state, how you bound them. Marriage, they call it. A sacrament, a contract.  A thing the government should tread lightly on, like a grave.\n\nBaptism, that's a matter of the soul.  Taxes, benefits, those are the things the world deals in.  If two souls find union, let it be a civil matter. No need to delve into the heart of it, the reasons behind the vows. Just two people, bound together.\n\nThe clamor for federal law, for a ban etched in stone, it's a dangerous thing. The Constitution, a fragile thing, meant to endure, not to be changed on a whim. Some say it's a matter of principle. But principle shouldn't come at the cost of compassion.\n\nIt's a simple truth: love, it finds its own way.",
            "Raised in the fold.  A Christian upbringing.  It casts a shadow. Matters of this kind, they hang there like smoke in the air.  Gay friends. Good people. But the ways they walk, it ain't the path I know.  Still, the law, it should run its course. Let each state make its own reckoning.  \n\nDemocracy, it's a patchwork quilt. Some squares lean blue, others red.  Where the people live, that's where the will lies.  A man can't tell a mountain to change its face.\n\nLet the states decide.  Give 'em the right to choose.  The president, he sits in Washington, a long way from the dusty crossroads of life. Let him tend to his own fires.\n\nAnd the ban, that's a heavy hand.  A president shouldn't have the power to dictate the heart of a nation, to bind its souls.  Let the light of each state shine on its own.",
            "The air hung thick, heavy with the weight of it.  Myspace. Public. A bulletin board, open to the wind.  They see it, these things, the words etched in the ether. Doesn't matter if it's under the school's name or not. The web, it reaches everywhere.  Schools, they have a duty.  To keep the children safe. To guard against the darkness. A life saved.  Is that an invasion?\n\nThere's a price we pay for expression.  The internet, it remembers.  Every whispered word, every careless click.  It comes back, a shadow in the corner of your eye. \n\nThey say the internet is a public square.  But what of the whispers in the dark? The things we think but don't say?  Are those not ours to keep?\n\nBut the school, they're looking for the danger. The smoke signals of violence.  And what of that?  An eye on the horizon.  A shield against the storm.",
            "The war. A wound that opened raw. Nine-Eleven. It etched itself on the bone. I was young then, filled with fire. Wanted to answer the call. Make them pay for the blood spilled. A reckoning. But the reckoning came cheap. No plan, no thought to the dust it would raise. We went in blind. Thought the steel of our will could bend a nation. But they were twisted steel themselves. Fought amongst themselves, a storm of vipers. What good a storm against a desert?\n\nMaybe the blood had cooled, made me see clearer. The faces, the names, they blur. They fight their own wars, their own wars of god and man.  What's it to us? We went looking for ghosts, for shadows. Found only more shadows. They're not like us. Their god is a different beast, their justice a different measure. They don't want peace. They want us gone. And maybe that's the only peace they know.\n\nWe went for revenge, a righteous cause they called it. But righteousness is a weapon that cuts both ways. We think we bring order, but we bring only more chaos. We built monuments of sand that crumble with the wind.\n\nThey say we can't leave them. But leaving is the only way to let them be. To let them learn their own lessons, carve their own fate. Maybe that's the true measure of a man, to know when to walk away. To let the dust settle."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

The Church, it clings to shadows, to old ways. \n\nThey say priests are bound to God. But what of the man? What of his needs? His heart?

Some folks say it threatens the natural order, the family as God ordained. But that's a thin veil, a superstition.  Love is love. Two souls bound together, it matters not the flesh they wear.\n\nThese are not some sideways, deviant things. They're just different faces of the same coin. One side heads, the other tails, but both born of the same metal. The state, it should be indifferent to the shape of a heart, only to the fact that it beats.\n\nTake their rights, their civil rights. A man beside his sick partner, they can't even sit by his bedside. Can't make decisions for him. A sick man alone, cut off from the one who holds him close. It's a cold, barren world they're building.\n\nAnd the science, it's clear as day.  These relationships, they're as strong, as resilient, as any other. The same joys, the same sorrows, the same hopes and dreams.\n\nThey're not asking for special favors, just the same rights. A piece of paper, a legal recognition of a bond already forged. Not a church ceremony, not a blessing from some higher power. Just a simple acknowledgement.\n\nThe church, it can hold its own ceremonies, bless its own unions. But the state, it should not be tangled in the threads of dogma. It should not legislate morality.\n\nA separation of church and state.  It's a principle worth fighting for. A principle that should apply to all, not just those who fit some narrow definition of right and good.\n\nTo deny them marriage, it's like segregation. Separate but unequal. To say they are less worthy, less deserving of the same protections. It's a stain on the soul of this nation.",

Little dresses, shoes to match, a purse small as a sparrow's nest. All of it, every Sunday. Private school, friends there too. We'd gather, a flock. But now, they've made this thing, a mass for the young. Thirty minutes sharp, quick as a sparrow's flight. Folks come in their beach clothes, sand still clinging to them like memory. Families, running late, late as the setting sun.  It's all become casual. Even the morning masses, where I used to dress for the occasion, now jeans and khakis.

The prime minister, a puppet. And Sadr, the firebrand, he holds sway in the halls of power. All factions, vying for control, tearing the country apart.\n\nA tangled web, a poisoned well.

Walls built of expectation, of a curated self.  But what if the walls weren't meant to be seen? What if some things should stay buried, in the shadows?  \n\nThey say there are eyes watching, always watching.  A single soul sifting through the digital detritus, looking for signs, for whispers of danger. A Sisyphean task, they say, to watch every face, every profile.  But what if it's not random?

A hunter stalking prey, using the very light they cast to find their target.\n\nIt's a cold comfort, knowing that someone saw the darkness, that they tried to pull back the curtain.

It was a bad idea then, a bad idea now, a bad idea etched in the sand. \n\nThe polls, they tell a story. Eighty percent, they say, think it was a fool's errand. Eighty percent of the people caught in the crossfire. Seventy percent of those sent to fight it, boys barely men,  see the wasteland for what it is. Even the ones who hold the reins, they know. Deep down, they see the quicksand sucking them under.\n\nDemocracy, they call it. A seed sown in barren ground. Can you force it to grow? Can you bring the light of a different sun to a land that knows only its own shadows?  Saddam was a devil, that much is true. But devils are children's stories compared to the monster we've made. A monster of our own making, born of hubris and misplaced purpose.\n\nPull out?  It's a gamble, they say. More chaos, more blood.  But what's left to lose?

It matters little in the end.\n\nWe'll never be the good guys here. Not in this land of ancient grudges and shifting sands.  But maybe, just maybe, we can learn to walk away.

Always have.  The world built for men.  A man to be the hammer, the anvil, the steel.  And a woman?  She's the nail.  Even now.  \n\nBut men feel the sting too.  In their own way.  Fashion, for instance. A man there, a man who knows cloth and color, he's seen as a curiosity.  A boy playing dress-up.  Too delicate for the rough edges of the world. \n\nAnd what about the man who stays home?  He's a shadow, a ghost in the corner.  A whisper of a thing that shouldn't be.  Society says a man works, provides, is the breadwinner.  But what if a man wants something else?  What if he wants to build a world with his children, to nurture, to love?  He's met with suspicion.  Doubt.  Like he's broken a law.\n\nThis thing, this discrimination.  It's a long shadow, stretching back centuries.  But it's changing. Slowly.  One nail at a time.  Women rising, men finding their place.  The world is shifting, groaning, trying to find a new balance.  It won't be easy.  But it has to be done.",
            "They didn't legalize it, no. Decriminalized. Dropped it down from felon to fender bender. A citation. Not the whole booking, jail, arraignment routine. Still, the mark lingers, even if it ain't a felony. Job apps, background checks, all that shit. Future repercussions. That's what worries folks.\n\nBut listen. Locking folks up costs. Ain't cheap. Booking, housing, court dates, public defenders, judges' fees, state attorneys chasing charges.  It's a drain. Towns, strapped for cash, they see that. Some places, they just won't budge. Stuck in their ways, they are. Even if it meant money for schools, for the old folks, for the hungry.\n\nDenver's different. More open-minded, you know?  They see the money, the potential.  Public education, social programs, feeding the hungry. That's what the tax dollars can buy.  \n\nMarijuana, it ain't something to just throw open the door for.  There's a right way, a wrong way. Legalize it, and it's like cigarettes, everywhere. Gas stations, parks, kids smoking and driving. It's a slippery slope. \n\nThen there's the stigma. It's still there, for a lot of folks. In some places, it's taboo.  Openly smoking, it'd be awkward.  Just sayin'.\n\nAlcohol, it'll wreck your coordination.  But marijuana, it messes with your life. Your choices, your routine. Different folks, different reactions.  Some folks, they self-destruct. Some, they find a balance.  Hard to say for sure. Both have their downsides.",
            "The Church. They hold fast to the old ways.  A long tradition, hard-set like the hills. Good, in a way. Roots run deep. But the world shifts. A river cuts new paths. The Church, she's slow to turn.  \n\nThey speak of love, of opening your heart. Yet the walls are high.  An Episcopalian father, a Catholic mother. Denied communion.  A house divided. They say love all men, yet turn from those who don't walk their path. \n\nHypocrisy hangs thick as smoke in the incense. Doctrine whispers of one thing, practice another.  The old books, they gather dust. The world moves on, but the Church clings tight. \n\nLetting priests marry. Some say it would bring change.  Might cleanse the stain. But the darkness, it lives deep inside. A man's heart can be twisted, no matter the vow.  A child, a vulnerable thing.  Love, they say. But some hearts know only hunger.",
            "The matter hangs heavy. A knot in the gut. I haven't come to terms with it myself, can't say one side is right, the other wrong.  But it's a thorny thing, this business of church and state, how you bound them. Marriage, they call it. A sacrament, a contract.  A thing the government should tread lightly on, like a grave.\n\nBaptism, that's a matter of the soul.  Taxes, benefits, those are the things the world deals in.  If two souls find union, let it be a civil matter. No need to delve into the heart of it, the reasons behind the vows. Just two people, bound together.\n\nThe clamor for federal law, for a ban etched in stone, it's a dangerous thing. The Constitution, a fragile thing, meant to endure, not to be changed on a whim. Some say it's a matter of principle. But principle shouldn't come at the cost of compassion.\n\nIt's a simple truth: love, it finds its own way.",
            "Raised in the fold.  A Christian upbringing.  It casts a shadow. Matters of this kind, they hang there like smoke in the air.  Gay friends. Good people. But the ways they walk, it ain't the path I know.  Still, the law, it should run its course. Let each state make its own reckoning.  \n\nDemocracy, it's a patchwork quilt. Some squares lean blue, others red.  Where the people live, that's where the will lies.  A man can't tell a mountain to change its face.\n\nLet the states decide.  Give 'em the right to choose.  The president, he sits in Washington, a long way from the dusty crossroads of life. Let him tend to his own fires.\n\nAnd the ban, that's a heavy hand.  A president shouldn't have the power to dictate the heart of a nation, to bind its souls.  Let the light of each state shine on its own.",
            "The air hung thick, heavy with the weight of it.  Myspace. Public. A bulletin board, open to the wind.  They see it, these things, the words etched in the ether. Doesn't matter if it's under the school's name or not. The web, it reaches everywhere.  Schools, they have a duty.  To keep the children safe. To guard against the darkness. A life saved.  Is that an invasion?\n\nThere's a price we pay for expression.  The internet, it remembers.  Every whispered word, every careless click.  It comes back, a shadow in the corner of your eye. \n\nThey say the internet is a public square.  But what of the whispers in the dark? The things we think but don't say?  Are those not ours to keep?\n\nBut the school, they're looking for the danger. The smoke signals of violence.  And what of that?  An eye on the horizon.  A shield against the storm.",
            "The war. A wound that opened raw. Nine-Eleven. It etched itself on the bone. I was young then, filled with fire. Wanted to answer the call. Make them pay for the blood spilled. A reckoning. But the reckoning came cheap. No plan, no thought to the dust it would raise. We went in blind. Thought the steel of our will could bend a nation. But they were twisted steel themselves. Fought amongst themselves, a storm of vipers. What good a storm against a desert?\n\nMaybe the blood had cooled, made me see clearer. The faces, the names, they blur. They fight their own wars, their own wars of god and man.  What's it to us? We went looking for ghosts, for shadows. Found only more shadows. They're not like us. Their god is a different beast, their justice a different measure. They don't want peace. They want us gone. And maybe that's the only peace they know.\n\nWe went for revenge, a righteous cause they called it. But righteousness is a weapon that cuts both ways. We think we bring order, but we bring only more chaos. We built monuments of sand that crumble with the wind.\n\nThey say we can't leave them. But leaving is the only way to let them be. To let them learn their own lessons, carve their own fate. Maybe that's the true measure of a man, to know when to walk away. To let the dust settle."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

Right and wrong.  But maybe, just maybe, the world ain't so black and white anymore. Maybe there's shades of gray in there somewhere. Maybe the church needs to see that. Maybe it needs to loosen its grip a little.  Let the light in. Let folks in. Or it'll keep watching its flock dwindle.  It's a hard thing, this faith.  A hard thing to hold onto when the world keeps spinning and changing around you.",
            "The man spoke slow. He wasn’t saying he was against it. Marriage. Same-sex. He’d heard the talk. The questions. But it seemed to him like a thing settled in the blood. You were born this way or that. No choice in the matter.  Like the color of your eyes. Didn't seem right to hold a man accountable for the color of his eyes. Or the way his heart beat. Men and women. Two men. Two women. What was the difference? A line drawn in the dust. The government, he figured, didn't make the rules of the heart.  They shouldn't be in the business of judging it.",

That they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  Yet some cling to shadows, to fears of the Other, to whispered tales of deviance. They speak of the sanctity of the family, a vision as fragile as spun glass, threatened by the mere existence of love beyond their narrow understanding. \n\nBut love knows no creed, no color, no rubric of prejudice. Two souls bound by a bond as strong as any forged in the fires of convention, they seek only the right to shelter beneath the same roof, to share the burdens and the blessings of life. They ask not for the blessing of the church, but of the law, a cold and impartial measure of justice.\n\nTheirs is a fight not for special privilege, but for equality. A right to the same protections, the same dignity, the same stake in the fabric of society. To deny them this is to deny a fundamental truth, to cleave the human spirit with the blunt instrument of intolerance. \n\nThe world shifts. The winds of change blow, carrying with them the whispers of progress. The tide of history turns. The day will come when the law reflects the truth, when love conquers fear, when all are embraced under the vast and unwavering sky.",

And the laws, they don't always hold the answers. \n\nJust because a thing is outlawed, doesn't mean it holds no worth. A rustle in the leaves, a whispered word, a touch of something strange. It can be a blessing or a curse. Like the plant itself, the one they call marijuana.\n\nIt's true, the word carries a stigma. A shadow falls upon it. But in the hushed quiet of the dispensary, there are things we use, powerful things, that are lined with the same kind of fear. Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets. They too walk a tightrope, the line between relief and ruin. And they are used, for the good, in the hands of the skilled.\n\nSo why deny the same to the green one? Let it breathe, let it heal.  \n\nWe talk of alcohol, a legal poison. But its embrace is a quick one, a sudden fall. Marijuana, it lingers, a slow burn. It can be a companion, a solace, if treated with respect.\n\nThere's a path, a slow one, a gradual shedding of the fear. Let the world see it, understand it, and maybe, just maybe, it will find its place. \n\nNot a flood, not an unleashing. But a quiet integration, a whisper of acceptance.

            "The church, it's changed. Not the way you'd think, not in the bones of it, but in the flesh. When I was a girl, Sunday meant lace and bows, matching shoes, a purse small enough to hold a prayer. The schoolgirls, all of us, dressed like dolls. But now? They've got these things, \"teenager masses.\" Thirty minutes, tops. Folks come straight from the beach, sand clinging to their legs, kids kicking at the pews, families late and breathless.  Even the morning services, the ones I used to dress for, jeans and khakis now.  It's a different kind of Sunday.\n\nThe politics, the talk of priests and sins, that's not my concern. This is the church I know. A place of hushed whispers, of stained glass and the smell of incense. But the people, they've changed. \n\nAs for the darkness, the things they say about the men of cloth, well, there's evil in the world, in every heart. You can't hide it with vows or robes. Some men, they're born with a darkness inside, a hunger that can't be sated. Marriage wouldn't change that. It might even make it worse.",
            "The laugh died in his throat.  At first, the notion hadn't seemed so bad. But the air hung heavy with the dust of the towers, the world still reeling.  They went into Iraq, he thought, under the shadow of a lie. Pretexts spun like cobwebs, connecting the desert sands to the ashes of September. The Bush men, they said Saddam had weapons, that he’d had a hand in the fall of the towers. But the desert yielded no such arms.  The lie festered in his gut, a bitter pill. The blood of Iraq, he thought, boiled in his veins.\n\nThe administration, he felt certain, had spoken falsehoods to the people, had sold them a war wrapped in deceit.  Powell himself, the man who’d stood before the world, now spoke of doubt, of a conviction not felt. A betrayal. A stain on the office.  An impeachable offense, he thought, to lie to the people, to twist the fabric of truth.\n\nHe saw a disregard for the Constitution, a creeping erosion since the towers fell.  A thirst for war, a hunger for blood.  He remembered the talk, whispers in the halls of power, of a man with a score to settle, a son seeking vengeance for his father’s wounds. And oil, he thought, the black gold, a constant undercurrent, a motive as old as time.\n\nHe thought of the endless nights, the bodies piled high, the ghosts of a war that promised so much and delivered so little. The talk now was of a new order, a coalition of nations, but he saw only the seeds of further conflict. Iraq, a nation fractured, a land consumed by strife.\n\nNews reports spoke of a dissolving government, a parliament paralyzed. Al-Sadr, the man they’d fought, now wielded a seat in the halls of power. The country, he thought, was a powder keg, waiting for the spark. \n\nHe laughed, a hollow sound, the laugh of a man who saw only darkness ahead.",
            "The desert wind scoured the harsh plains, a whisper of dust devils dancing on the horizon.  This war, this thing in Iraq. It felt hollow, a name etched in sand. No formal declaration, no solemn vows. Just a whisper of vengeance, a ghost of September's burning skies. A reckoning, they said.  But for what? To build a mirror image of ourselves, a pale reflection of freedom in a land of ancient shadows? Or to bleed the earth dry of its oil, to feed the insatiable maw of industry?  \n\nThe faces of the dead, boys and girls, etched with the weariness of men twice their age.  Their ghosts haunted the streets, their families mourning under a sun that offered no solace. A futile fight, this dance with shadows. A struggle to impose a light that refused to burn in the darkness. Democracy, they called it. A fragile thing, blooming in the ashes of a shattered world.\n\nBut the desert remembers. It remembers the empires that rose and fell, leaving only whispers on the wind.  And it remembers the cost of forgetting. The endless cycle of violence, the thirst for power, the echo of gunfire in the hollow silence of a forgotten land.",
            "The notion, the very idea of it being made legal, of a state daring to lay claim to such a thing, that chills the blood. It sits wrong in the gut, like a bad turn in the road.  The Constitution, that old document, it speaks plainly on this matter. Separation. Church and state.  A line drawn in the dust, a line meant to be respected.  To tread upon it, to try and bend it to some new purpose, that's defiance. Defiance of what's been etched in stone.\n\nThey say they want to make it illegal. But who are they to decide?  Who gets to say which church's creed holds sway? The Catholics, the Christians, most of them, they stand against it. A wall of disapproval stretching from sea to shining sea.  But the government, it shouldn't be in the business of choosing.  It shouldn't be picking winners and losers in this sacred game.  \n\nThe Constitution, it stands as a bulwark against such tyranny. It promised freedom, a place where the whisperings of the spirit could speak without fear.  To amend it, to twist it to fit some narrow view, that's a betrayal. A betrayal of the very principles it was built upon.\n\nThis isn't about economics or progress. This is about the soul of a nation.  This is about the right to believe, to worship, to live according to the dictates of one's heart.  And that right, that right must be protected, fiercely and without compromise.",

They said it was vengeance, a reckoning for the smoke and ash that choked the air. But the truth is a hard thing to swallow. The link they forged, thin and brittle, stretched 'tween the dust of New York and the sands of the desert. A phantom connection spun to bind a nation's anger, to justify the coming storm.\n\nI've always held a bone-deep aversion to war, a resistance to the spilling of blood. Especially the preemptive strike, a gamble cast with lives as currency. The ghosts of Vietnam whisper in the wind, a cautionary tale etched in blood and mud. They should have listened.\n\nA nation's sons returned broken, hollowed by the desert sun.  They tore down a government, leaving a gaping maw of power, a void choked with chaos. They spoke of democracy, but the seeds they planted took root in a wasteland.  \n\nThey sought to impose their will, to shape a nation in their image, just as they'd done before in the emerald hills of Southeast Asia.  But you can't force a nation to bloom. It's a slow, painful process, a dance with the spirits of the land.\n\nAnd the cost, the price they paid, was not merely measured in lives lost. It was etched in the faces of the returning soldiers, the haunted eyes that mirrored the abyss of their experience. It was in the silence that followed the echoes of gunfire, a silence pregnant with the ghosts of what could have been.\n\nThey promised a swift victory, a righteous crusade. But the desert mocked their hubris. The enemy was not a faceless army, but the very land itself, the people who bled and fought for their own destiny.  \n\nAnd as the years bled into decades, the question lingered: was it worth it? The price of oil, the whispers of weapons of mass destruction, the echoes of broken promises – they all faded into the desert wind, leaving behind a stain of regret, a wound that would never fully heal.",

But they can't call each other husband. They can't share a home, a life, the simple right to be together. It's a cruelty, a kind of slow, grinding injustice.  Some say it's a choice. A whim. But the choice to love, to want, that ain't a choice. It's a fire in the belly, a star in the sky. It's the way God made us. Or maybe made us to be.

To sift through the digital detritus of others, to peer into their windows of the mind, was that not a trespass?\n\nHe thought of Myspace, that digital frontier where souls were laid bare, exposed to the gaze of strangers. A friend's permission, a click of the mouse, and the veil was lifted. But who were these friends, these unseen hands reaching into the digital hearth? \n\nThe thought of a warden, a digital sheriff, patrolling these virtual streets, his eyes scanning profiles, searching for trouble, struck him as a chilling prospect. A violation of a different kind, a creeping shadow falling over the promise of anonymity.\n\nHe thought of his own Facebook, its pages filled with the ghosts of past conversations, the echoes of laughter and shared moments captured in pixels. A fleeting glimpse, a word left hanging in the void, could be twisted, misinterpreted, weaponized. It was a delicate balance, this public display of self, this offering to the digital gods.\n\nHe thought of the man on the screen, the one who had shown how easily a stranger could slip into your life, how quickly a facade could be shattered. A screen name, a click, and the door was open. \n\nThe school, he thought, trying to ban Myspace, to control the flow of information, it seemed a futile gesture.

Eighty percent wanted them gone.  Their voices, drowned out by the roar of war, deserved to be heard.\n\nNo, they’d never be the good guys. Not in that place.  But maybe, just maybe, they could leave with their heads held a little higher. Less stained.",
            "The world, it ain't changed that much. Women still struggle. Men too, in their own way. It ain't just 'bout the skirts. It's the field you walk into, the way folks look at you.\n\nWomen, they got that glass ceiling. Even with equality talked 'bout, men still got a hard time with a woman boss. It's the way things always been, the way folks been raised. A woman, she sees a job, got the skill for it, but the board, they don't see it. Too much history there, women in the high places.\n\nSame goes for men. Fashion, for instance. A man, he likes clothes, they look at him sideways. Like he ain't got a clue 'bout the real world, 'bout women's things.\n\nAnd stay-at-home dads? Forget about it. Society says a man's gotta be the breadwinner. If he's home with the kids, they whisper. Like he ain't got the guts to face the world. \n\nChange, it's slow.  It's a long road, but we're inching forward. More women in power. More men at home. Folks gettin' used to it, though it takes time.",
            "They didn't legalize it. Not exactly. Decriminalized, they called it. Knocked it down a notch. From a crime, you see, to a citation. Like a parking ticket. No cuffs, no lockup. Just a mark against your name. But the mark, it lingers. Job interviews, background checks. The specter of the charge, even if it ain't a crime no more.\n\nSee, kids worry about that. The future, the scars. And those don't fade with a change in the law. But there's a cost to this war, too. The cost of catching them, holding them, feeding them, hauling them in and out of court. Cost of lawyers and judges and the state's endless hunger for charges.  All that money, it bleeds the cities dry.\n\nSome towns, they cling to the old ways, even if it means broke coffers and hollow promises.  But in places like Denver, where the wind blows freer, where folks are a little more open, maybe that money could go to schools, to the hungry, to the forgotten. \n\nMarijuana, it ain't something you want spilled on every street corner.  It's got its own demons, its own shadows. But there's a pragmatism to it too. A balance.\n\nLegalize it, and who knows what happens? Cigarettes sold at gas stations, smoke curling from every car window? People driving high, stumbling through life?  There's a stigma yet, a hidden shame.  Out in the open, it'd feel wrong, wouldn't it?\n\nAlcohol, it's got its own demons, too. But marijuana, it lingers. It changes you, seeps into your bones, your thoughts. \n\nIt's different for everyone, ain't it? Some folks, they go all in, embrace the darkness. Others, they find a way to live with it. But the truth is, no two souls react the same.",
            "They say yes, these men in their collars. A long tradition they cling to, a way of doing things as they've always been done. Rooted. They call it that. But the world, it shifts. Changes. And the roots, they can't hold forever. They speak of doctrine, of scripture, of God's will. But the way they twist it, the way they judge those who don't fit their mold, it feels like a different god altogether. \n\nMy father, he was an Episcopalian. A good man. My mother, she was Catholic, a woman of faith. They loved each other. But the church? The church said no. Not good enough. Not the right kind. A stain on their holy cloth.\n\nThey preach love, they preach mercy. But their actions speak louder. Their doors are shut to the different, to the lost. Hypocrisy, it whispers in the shadows, a dirge for the broken.\n\nThey say the priests should be celibate. That it's God's will. But is it God's will to allow the innocent to be preyed upon? Is it God's will to shroud the darkness beneath a veil of scripture?\n\nI see the sickness, the rot at the heart of it all. Marriage, they say, wouldn't change it. But what else is there? A wall built on fear and tradition, guarded by men who have forgotten what it means to be human.",
            "The matter weighs heavy. I haven't come to a reckoning, can't say one side holds the light and the other the dark. But this, this is the tangled knot we face. The line between the temple and the law, blurred by the question of who defines the bond. A sacrament, some say. A civil contract, others. To legislate love, to codify devotion, it cuts both ways. Like baptism, a sacrament, the state should look no further. Two souls joined, that's what matters. No need for the government to pry into the nature of the union, the gospel of their hearts. Civil union. That's the way. Leave it there. Let the church speak to the spirit, the state to the contract.  \n\nLet the states find their own truth, their own solution. If they can agree, then let it climb to the federal level. But a ban etched in the constitution? That's a dark stain on the fabric of this nation. A heavy hand, a hammer blow against the heart of freedom. Some say it's a matter of principle, but it's a principle built on fear, not reason. The constitution, a fragile thing, not meant for such heavy burdens. To amend it for this, for this so-called sin? It's a waste, a needless scar.",
            "Raised in the fold. The Lord's word. A comfort, a shroud. But these things, these queer inclinations, they lay in the shadow. A gray area. Friends, some of them, walked a different path. Not my path, not the one laid out. But the law, that's a different matter altogether. \n\nLet the states decide. Each one a kingdom unto itself. Democratic or Republican, they hold the balance. In the blue states, the wind blows a different way. Marriage, a right, a sacrament. And a man chooses his home, his place in the world. If he lives in a place where that path is open, then he lives by its laws.\n\nThe whole country, bound by the will of one man, a man in Washington. It ain't right. Let the states hold the reins. Let them wrestle with the devil in their own fields.\n\nTwo years, that's all he has left. Time enough for change. A new wind will blow. And when it does, the old man's words will be dust in the wind.",
            "The boy cleared his throat.  \"No sir, not at all.\" He paused, eyes fixed on some distant point. \"Myspace, it's a public thing. Like a bulletin board. If you post something, you're putting it out there. For anyone to see. The school officials, they have a right to see it. Even if they weren't acting under the name of the school. They could find it, just the same. Through their own eyes, in their own homes.\"\n\nHe shifted, the words catching in his throat. \"But if it saves lives, if it keeps the kids safe... that's the school's duty, ain't it? To protect them. If that means looking at what they're posting, then I reckon it's a small price to pay.\"\n\nHe trailed off, then leaned back, a shadow falling over his face. \"It's different when they're snooping, looking for reasons to get kids in trouble.  Looking for drinking or smoking or whatever. That's an invasion.  But if they're trying to stop something bad, something like that... Columbine, God forbid... then I don't see the harm.\"\n\n\nHe sighed, the question hanging in the air. \"It's a thin line, ain't it? Between protecting kids and taking away their privacy.\"",
            "The war. It hit hard. Like a fist to the gut. Nine Eleven. Couldn't forget it. Couldn't forgive it.  An echo in the bone. At first, I was for it. For the payback. For the fire. They came here, rained down their fire, and we'd rain ours down on them. It was pure, raw feeling. Anger. Justice.  But the anger, it burned hot and fast. The long burn, the slow burn, that was the one we overlooked.  We went in blind. No plan. No answers. And it backfired.  Bad.\n\nNow I see it different. A different kind of fire. The kind that burns slow and deep, eats at the soul.  They fight amongst themselves, these people. Can't see the bigger picture. Us being there, it don't change that. They're lost in their own darkness.  \n\nI don't know. Maybe it's the Nine Eleven thing. Maybe it's the seeing the faces, the empty eyes. Makes you wonder. Makes you question. Are they human? Or something else? Something born of the dust and the heat.  They fight, they kill, they destroy. But they don't build.  Don't understand.\n\nWe went in unprepared. The desert's a different beast. The war's different. They don't play by our rules. They're feral. Savage. They want us out. And maybe that's the answer. Maybe we need to walk away. Let them sort themselves out.\n\nWe were hyped, fueled by anger. We wanted to punish them. Not to heal them.  President Bush, he rode the wave. The people wanted it. And he gave it to them.\n\nBut there was no plan. No vision.  Just fire and fury. And now we're left with the ashes. \n\nMaybe we're not the ones to fix them. Maybe they're beyond fixing.  Maybe the fire is all they know.\n\nWe can't stay forever. It's a poison, this war. It eats at you. \n\nIt's time to go."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

Right and wrong.  But maybe, just maybe, the world ain't so black and white anymore. Maybe there's shades of gray in there somewhere. Maybe the church needs to see that. Maybe it needs to loosen its grip a little.  Let the light in. Let folks in. Or it'll keep watching its flock dwindle.  It's a hard thing, this faith.  A hard thing to hold onto when the world keeps spinning and changing around you.",
            "The man spoke slow. He wasn’t saying he was against it. Marriage. Same-sex. He’d heard the talk. The questions. But it seemed to him like a thing settled in the blood. You were born this way or that. No choice in the matter.  Like the color of your eyes. Didn't seem right to hold a man accountable for the color of his eyes. Or the way his heart beat. Men and women. Two men. Two women. What was the difference? A line drawn in the dust. The government, he figured, didn't make the rules of the heart.  They shouldn't be in the business of judging it.",

That they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  Yet some cling to shadows, to fears of the Other, to whispered tales of deviance. They speak of the sanctity of the family, a vision as fragile as spun glass, threatened by the mere existence of love beyond their narrow understanding. \n\nBut love knows no creed, no color, no rubric of prejudice. Two souls bound by a bond as strong as any forged in the fires of convention, they seek only the right to shelter beneath the same roof, to share the burdens and the blessings of life. They ask not for the blessing of the church, but of the law, a cold and impartial measure of justice.\n\nTheirs is a fight not for special privilege, but for equality. A right to the same protections, the same dignity, the same stake in the fabric of society. To deny them this is to deny a fundamental truth, to cleave the human spirit with the blunt instrument of intolerance. \n\nThe world shifts. The winds of change blow, carrying with them the whispers of progress. The tide of history turns. The day will come when the law reflects the truth, when love conquers fear, when all are embraced under the vast and unwavering sky.",

And the laws, they don't always hold the answers. \n\nJust because a thing is outlawed, doesn't mean it holds no worth. A rustle in the leaves, a whispered word, a touch of something strange. It can be a blessing or a curse. Like the plant itself, the one they call marijuana.\n\nIt's true, the word carries a stigma. A shadow falls upon it. But in the hushed quiet of the dispensary, there are things we use, powerful things, that are lined with the same kind of fear. Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets. They too walk a tightrope, the line between relief and ruin. And they are used, for the good, in the hands of the skilled.\n\nSo why deny the same to the green one? Let it breathe, let it heal.  \n\nWe talk of alcohol, a legal poison. But its embrace is a quick one, a sudden fall. Marijuana, it lingers, a slow burn. It can be a companion, a solace, if treated with respect.\n\nThere's a path, a slow one, a gradual shedding of the fear. Let the world see it, understand it, and maybe, just maybe, it will find its place. \n\nNot a flood, not an unleashing. But a quiet integration, a whisper of acceptance.

            "The church, it's changed. Not the way you'd think, not in the bones of it, but in the flesh. When I was a girl, Sunday meant lace and bows, matching shoes, a purse small enough to hold a prayer. The schoolgirls, all of us, dressed like dolls. But now? They've got these things, \"teenager masses.\" Thirty minutes, tops. Folks come straight from the beach, sand clinging to their legs, kids kicking at the pews, families late and breathless.  Even the morning services, the ones I used to dress for, jeans and khakis now.  It's a different kind of Sunday.\n\nThe politics, the talk of priests and sins, that's not my concern. This is the church I know. A place of hushed whispers, of stained glass and the smell of incense. But the people, they've changed. \n\nAs for the darkness, the things they say about the men of cloth, well, there's evil in the world, in every heart. You can't hide it with vows or robes. Some men, they're born with a darkness inside, a hunger that can't be sated. Marriage wouldn't change that. It might even make it worse.",
            "The laugh died in his throat.  At first, the notion hadn't seemed so bad. But the air hung heavy with the dust of the towers, the world still reeling.  They went into Iraq, he thought, under the shadow of a lie. Pretexts spun like cobwebs, connecting the desert sands to the ashes of September. The Bush men, they said Saddam had weapons, that he’d had a hand in the fall of the towers. But the desert yielded no such arms.  The lie festered in his gut, a bitter pill. The blood of Iraq, he thought, boiled in his veins.\n\nThe administration, he felt certain, had spoken falsehoods to the people, had sold them a war wrapped in deceit.  Powell himself, the man who’d stood before the world, now spoke of doubt, of a conviction not felt. A betrayal. A stain on the office.  An impeachable offense, he thought, to lie to the people, to twist the fabric of truth.\n\nHe saw a disregard for the Constitution, a creeping erosion since the towers fell.  A thirst for war, a hunger for blood.  He remembered the talk, whispers in the halls of power, of a man with a score to settle, a son seeking vengeance for his father’s wounds. And oil, he thought, the black gold, a constant undercurrent, a motive as old as time.\n\nHe thought of the endless nights, the bodies piled high, the ghosts of a war that promised so much and delivered so little. The talk now was of a new order, a coalition of nations, but he saw only the seeds of further conflict. Iraq, a nation fractured, a land consumed by strife.\n\nNews reports spoke of a dissolving government, a parliament paralyzed. Al-Sadr, the man they’d fought, now wielded a seat in the halls of power. The country, he thought, was a powder keg, waiting for the spark. \n\nHe laughed, a hollow sound, the laugh of a man who saw only darkness ahead.",
            "The desert wind scoured the harsh plains, a whisper of dust devils dancing on the horizon.  This war, this thing in Iraq. It felt hollow, a name etched in sand. No formal declaration, no solemn vows. Just a whisper of vengeance, a ghost of September's burning skies. A reckoning, they said.  But for what? To build a mirror image of ourselves, a pale reflection of freedom in a land of ancient shadows? Or to bleed the earth dry of its oil, to feed the insatiable maw of industry?  \n\nThe faces of the dead, boys and girls, etched with the weariness of men twice their age.  Their ghosts haunted the streets, their families mourning under a sun that offered no solace. A futile fight, this dance with shadows. A struggle to impose a light that refused to burn in the darkness. Democracy, they called it. A fragile thing, blooming in the ashes of a shattered world.\n\nBut the desert remembers. It remembers the empires that rose and fell, leaving only whispers on the wind.  And it remembers the cost of forgetting. The endless cycle of violence, the thirst for power, the echo of gunfire in the hollow silence of a forgotten land.",
            "The notion, the very idea of it being made legal, of a state daring to lay claim to such a thing, that chills the blood. It sits wrong in the gut, like a bad turn in the road.  The Constitution, that old document, it speaks plainly on this matter. Separation. Church and state.  A line drawn in the dust, a line meant to be respected.  To tread upon it, to try and bend it to some new purpose, that's defiance. Defiance of what's been etched in stone.\n\nThey say they want to make it illegal. But who are they to decide?  Who gets to say which church's creed holds sway? The Catholics, the Christians, most of them, they stand against it. A wall of disapproval stretching from sea to shining sea.  But the government, it shouldn't be in the business of choosing.  It shouldn't be picking winners and losers in this sacred game.  \n\nThe Constitution, it stands as a bulwark against such tyranny. It promised freedom, a place where the whisperings of the spirit could speak without fear.  To amend it, to twist it to fit some narrow view, that's a betrayal. A betrayal of the very principles it was built upon.\n\nThis isn't about economics or progress. This is about the soul of a nation.  This is about the right to believe, to worship, to live according to the dictates of one's heart.  And that right, that right must be protected, fiercely and without compromise.",

They said it was vengeance, a reckoning for the smoke and ash that choked the air. But the truth is a hard thing to swallow. The link they forged, thin and brittle, stretched 'tween the dust of New York and the sands of the desert. A phantom connection spun to bind a nation's anger, to justify the coming storm.\n\nI've always held a bone-deep aversion to war, a resistance to the spilling of blood. Especially the preemptive strike, a gamble cast with lives as currency. The ghosts of Vietnam whisper in the wind, a cautionary tale etched in blood and mud. They should have listened.\n\nA nation's sons returned broken, hollowed by the desert sun.  They tore down a government, leaving a gaping maw of power, a void choked with chaos. They spoke of democracy, but the seeds they planted took root in a wasteland.  \n\nThey sought to impose their will, to shape a nation in their image, just as they'd done before in the emerald hills of Southeast Asia.  But you can't force a nation to bloom. It's a slow, painful process, a dance with the spirits of the land.\n\nAnd the cost, the price they paid, was not merely measured in lives lost. It was etched in the faces of the returning soldiers, the haunted eyes that mirrored the abyss of their experience. It was in the silence that followed the echoes of gunfire, a silence pregnant with the ghosts of what could have been.\n\nThey promised a swift victory, a righteous crusade. But the desert mocked their hubris. The enemy was not a faceless army, but the very land itself, the people who bled and fought for their own destiny.  \n\nAnd as the years bled into decades, the question lingered: was it worth it? The price of oil, the whispers of weapons of mass destruction, the echoes of broken promises – they all faded into the desert wind, leaving behind a stain of regret, a wound that would never fully heal.",

But they can't call each other husband. They can't share a home, a life, the simple right to be together. It's a cruelty, a kind of slow, grinding injustice.  Some say it's a choice. A whim. But the choice to love, to want, that ain't a choice. It's a fire in the belly, a star in the sky. It's the way God made us. Or maybe made us to be.

To sift through the digital detritus of others, to peer into their windows of the mind, was that not a trespass?\n\nHe thought of Myspace, that digital frontier where souls were laid bare, exposed to the gaze of strangers. A friend's permission, a click of the mouse, and the veil was lifted. But who were these friends, these unseen hands reaching into the digital hearth? \n\nThe thought of a warden, a digital sheriff, patrolling these virtual streets, his eyes scanning profiles, searching for trouble, struck him as a chilling prospect. A violation of a different kind, a creeping shadow falling over the promise of anonymity.\n\nHe thought of his own Facebook, its pages filled with the ghosts of past conversations, the echoes of laughter and shared moments captured in pixels. A fleeting glimpse, a word left hanging in the void, could be twisted, misinterpreted, weaponized. It was a delicate balance, this public display of self, this offering to the digital gods.\n\nHe thought of the man on the screen, the one who had shown how easily a stranger could slip into your life, how quickly a facade could be shattered. A screen name, a click, and the door was open. \n\nThe school, he thought, trying to ban Myspace, to control the flow of information, it seemed a futile gesture.

Eighty percent wanted them gone.  Their voices, drowned out by the roar of war, deserved to be heard.\n\nNo, they’d never be the good guys. Not in that place.  But maybe, just maybe, they could leave with their heads held a little higher. Less stained.",
            "The world, it ain't changed that much. Women still struggle. Men too, in their own way. It ain't just 'bout the skirts. It's the field you walk into, the way folks look at you.\n\nWomen, they got that glass ceiling. Even with equality talked 'bout, men still got a hard time with a woman boss. It's the way things always been, the way folks been raised. A woman, she sees a job, got the skill for it, but the board, they don't see it. Too much history there, women in the high places.\n\nSame goes for men. Fashion, for instance. A man, he likes clothes, they look at him sideways. Like he ain't got a clue 'bout the real world, 'bout women's things.\n\nAnd stay-at-home dads? Forget about it. Society says a man's gotta be the breadwinner. If he's home with the kids, they whisper. Like he ain't got the guts to face the world. \n\nChange, it's slow.  It's a long road, but we're inching forward. More women in power. More men at home. Folks gettin' used to it, though it takes time.",
            "They didn't legalize it. Not exactly. Decriminalized, they called it. Knocked it down a notch. From a crime, you see, to a citation. Like a parking ticket. No cuffs, no lockup. Just a mark against your name. But the mark, it lingers. Job interviews, background checks. The specter of the charge, even if it ain't a crime no more.\n\nSee, kids worry about that. The future, the scars. And those don't fade with a change in the law. But there's a cost to this war, too. The cost of catching them, holding them, feeding them, hauling them in and out of court. Cost of lawyers and judges and the state's endless hunger for charges.  All that money, it bleeds the cities dry.\n\nSome towns, they cling to the old ways, even if it means broke coffers and hollow promises.  But in places like Denver, where the wind blows freer, where folks are a little more open, maybe that money could go to schools, to the hungry, to the forgotten. \n\nMarijuana, it ain't something you want spilled on every street corner.  It's got its own demons, its own shadows. But there's a pragmatism to it too. A balance.\n\nLegalize it, and who knows what happens? Cigarettes sold at gas stations, smoke curling from every car window? People driving high, stumbling through life?  There's a stigma yet, a hidden shame.  Out in the open, it'd feel wrong, wouldn't it?\n\nAlcohol, it's got its own demons, too. But marijuana, it lingers. It changes you, seeps into your bones, your thoughts. \n\nIt's different for everyone, ain't it? Some folks, they go all in, embrace the darkness. Others, they find a way to live with it. But the truth is, no two souls react the same.",
            "They say yes, these men in their collars. A long tradition they cling to, a way of doing things as they've always been done. Rooted. They call it that. But the world, it shifts. Changes. And the roots, they can't hold forever. They speak of doctrine, of scripture, of God's will. But the way they twist it, the way they judge those who don't fit their mold, it feels like a different god altogether. \n\nMy father, he was an Episcopalian. A good man. My mother, she was Catholic, a woman of faith. They loved each other. But the church? The church said no. Not good enough. Not the right kind. A stain on their holy cloth.\n\nThey preach love, they preach mercy. But their actions speak louder. Their doors are shut to the different, to the lost. Hypocrisy, it whispers in the shadows, a dirge for the broken.\n\nThey say the priests should be celibate. That it's God's will. But is it God's will to allow the innocent to be preyed upon? Is it God's will to shroud the darkness beneath a veil of scripture?\n\nI see the sickness, the rot at the heart of it all. Marriage, they say, wouldn't change it. But what else is there? A wall built on fear and tradition, guarded by men who have forgotten what it means to be human.",
            "The matter weighs heavy. I haven't come to a reckoning, can't say one side holds the light and the other the dark. But this, this is the tangled knot we face. The line between the temple and the law, blurred by the question of who defines the bond. A sacrament, some say. A civil contract, others. To legislate love, to codify devotion, it cuts both ways. Like baptism, a sacrament, the state should look no further. Two souls joined, that's what matters. No need for the government to pry into the nature of the union, the gospel of their hearts. Civil union. That's the way. Leave it there. Let the church speak to the spirit, the state to the contract.  \n\nLet the states find their own truth, their own solution. If they can agree, then let it climb to the federal level. But a ban etched in the constitution? That's a dark stain on the fabric of this nation. A heavy hand, a hammer blow against the heart of freedom. Some say it's a matter of principle, but it's a principle built on fear, not reason. The constitution, a fragile thing, not meant for such heavy burdens. To amend it for this, for this so-called sin? It's a waste, a needless scar.",
            "Raised in the fold. The Lord's word. A comfort, a shroud. But these things, these queer inclinations, they lay in the shadow. A gray area. Friends, some of them, walked a different path. Not my path, not the one laid out. But the law, that's a different matter altogether. \n\nLet the states decide. Each one a kingdom unto itself. Democratic or Republican, they hold the balance. In the blue states, the wind blows a different way. Marriage, a right, a sacrament. And a man chooses his home, his place in the world. If he lives in a place where that path is open, then he lives by its laws.\n\nThe whole country, bound by the will of one man, a man in Washington. It ain't right. Let the states hold the reins. Let them wrestle with the devil in their own fields.\n\nTwo years, that's all he has left. Time enough for change. A new wind will blow. And when it does, the old man's words will be dust in the wind.",
            "The boy cleared his throat.  \"No sir, not at all.\" He paused, eyes fixed on some distant point. \"Myspace, it's a public thing. Like a bulletin board. If you post something, you're putting it out there. For anyone to see. The school officials, they have a right to see it. Even if they weren't acting under the name of the school. They could find it, just the same. Through their own eyes, in their own homes.\"\n\nHe shifted, the words catching in his throat. \"But if it saves lives, if it keeps the kids safe... that's the school's duty, ain't it? To protect them. If that means looking at what they're posting, then I reckon it's a small price to pay.\"\n\nHe trailed off, then leaned back, a shadow falling over his face. \"It's different when they're snooping, looking for reasons to get kids in trouble.  Looking for drinking or smoking or whatever. That's an invasion.  But if they're trying to stop something bad, something like that... Columbine, God forbid... then I don't see the harm.\"\n\n\nHe sighed, the question hanging in the air. \"It's a thin line, ain't it? Between protecting kids and taking away their privacy.\"",
            "The war. It hit hard. Like a fist to the gut. Nine Eleven. Couldn't forget it. Couldn't forgive it.  An echo in the bone. At first, I was for it. For the payback. For the fire. They came here, rained down their fire, and we'd rain ours down on them. It was pure, raw feeling. Anger. Justice.  But the anger, it burned hot and fast. The long burn, the slow burn, that was the one we overlooked.  We went in blind. No plan. No answers. And it backfired.  Bad.\n\nNow I see it different. A different kind of fire. The kind that burns slow and deep, eats at the soul.  They fight amongst themselves, these people. Can't see the bigger picture. Us being there, it don't change that. They're lost in their own darkness.  \n\nI don't know. Maybe it's the Nine Eleven thing. Maybe it's the seeing the faces, the empty eyes. Makes you wonder. Makes you question. Are they human? Or something else? Something born of the dust and the heat.  They fight, they kill, they destroy. But they don't build.  Don't understand.\n\nWe went in unprepared. The desert's a different beast. The war's different. They don't play by our rules. They're feral. Savage. They want us out. And maybe that's the answer. Maybe we need to walk away. Let them sort themselves out.\n\nWe were hyped, fueled by anger. We wanted to punish them. Not to heal them.  President Bush, he rode the wave. The people wanted it. And he gave it to them.\n\nBut there was no plan. No vision.  Just fire and fury. And now we're left with the ashes. \n\nMaybe we're not the ones to fix them. Maybe they're beyond fixing.  Maybe the fire is all they know.\n\nWe can't stay forever. It's a poison, this war. It eats at you. \n\nIt's time to go."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

Right and wrong.  But maybe, just maybe, the world ain't so black and white anymore. Maybe there's shades of gray in there somewhere. Maybe the church needs to see that. Maybe it needs to loosen its grip a little.  Let the light in. Let folks in. Or it'll keep watching its flock dwindle.  It's a hard thing, this faith.  A hard thing to hold onto when the world keeps spinning and changing around you.",
            "The man spoke slow. He wasn’t saying he was against it. Marriage. Same-sex. He’d heard the talk. The questions. But it seemed to him like a thing settled in the blood. You were born this way or that. No choice in the matter.  Like the color of your eyes. Didn't seem right to hold a man accountable for the color of his eyes. Or the way his heart beat. Men and women. Two men. Two women. What was the difference? A line drawn in the dust. The government, he figured, didn't make the rules of the heart.  They shouldn't be in the business of judging it.",

That they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  Yet some cling to shadows, to fears of the Other, to whispered tales of deviance. They speak of the sanctity of the family, a vision as fragile as spun glass, threatened by the mere existence of love beyond their narrow understanding. \n\nBut love knows no creed, no color, no rubric of prejudice. Two souls bound by a bond as strong as any forged in the fires of convention, they seek only the right to shelter beneath the same roof, to share the burdens and the blessings of life. They ask not for the blessing of the church, but of the law, a cold and impartial measure of justice.\n\nTheirs is a fight not for special privilege, but for equality. A right to the same protections, the same dignity, the same stake in the fabric of society. To deny them this is to deny a fundamental truth, to cleave the human spirit with the blunt instrument of intolerance. \n\nThe world shifts. The winds of change blow, carrying with them the whispers of progress. The tide of history turns. The day will come when the law reflects the truth, when love conquers fear, when all are embraced under the vast and unwavering sky.",

And the laws, they don't always hold the answers. \n\nJust because a thing is outlawed, doesn't mean it holds no worth. A rustle in the leaves, a whispered word, a touch of something strange. It can be a blessing or a curse. Like the plant itself, the one they call marijuana.\n\nIt's true, the word carries a stigma. A shadow falls upon it. But in the hushed quiet of the dispensary, there are things we use, powerful things, that are lined with the same kind of fear. Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets. They too walk a tightrope, the line between relief and ruin. And they are used, for the good, in the hands of the skilled.\n\nSo why deny the same to the green one? Let it breathe, let it heal.  \n\nWe talk of alcohol, a legal poison. But its embrace is a quick one, a sudden fall. Marijuana, it lingers, a slow burn. It can be a companion, a solace, if treated with respect.\n\nThere's a path, a slow one, a gradual shedding of the fear. Let the world see it, understand it, and maybe, just maybe, it will find its place. \n\nNot a flood, not an unleashing. But a quiet integration, a whisper of acceptance.

            "The church, it's changed. Not the way you'd think, not in the bones of it, but in the flesh. When I was a girl, Sunday meant lace and bows, matching shoes, a purse small enough to hold a prayer. The schoolgirls, all of us, dressed like dolls. But now? They've got these things, \"teenager masses.\" Thirty minutes, tops. Folks come straight from the beach, sand clinging to their legs, kids kicking at the pews, families late and breathless.  Even the morning services, the ones I used to dress for, jeans and khakis now.  It's a different kind of Sunday.\n\nThe politics, the talk of priests and sins, that's not my concern. This is the church I know. A place of hushed whispers, of stained glass and the smell of incense. But the people, they've changed. \n\nAs for the darkness, the things they say about the men of cloth, well, there's evil in the world, in every heart. You can't hide it with vows or robes. Some men, they're born with a darkness inside, a hunger that can't be sated. Marriage wouldn't change that. It might even make it worse.",
            "The laugh died in his throat.  At first, the notion hadn't seemed so bad. But the air hung heavy with the dust of the towers, the world still reeling.  They went into Iraq, he thought, under the shadow of a lie. Pretexts spun like cobwebs, connecting the desert sands to the ashes of September. The Bush men, they said Saddam had weapons, that he’d had a hand in the fall of the towers. But the desert yielded no such arms.  The lie festered in his gut, a bitter pill. The blood of Iraq, he thought, boiled in his veins.\n\nThe administration, he felt certain, had spoken falsehoods to the people, had sold them a war wrapped in deceit.  Powell himself, the man who’d stood before the world, now spoke of doubt, of a conviction not felt. A betrayal. A stain on the office.  An impeachable offense, he thought, to lie to the people, to twist the fabric of truth.\n\nHe saw a disregard for the Constitution, a creeping erosion since the towers fell.  A thirst for war, a hunger for blood.  He remembered the talk, whispers in the halls of power, of a man with a score to settle, a son seeking vengeance for his father’s wounds. And oil, he thought, the black gold, a constant undercurrent, a motive as old as time.\n\nHe thought of the endless nights, the bodies piled high, the ghosts of a war that promised so much and delivered so little. The talk now was of a new order, a coalition of nations, but he saw only the seeds of further conflict. Iraq, a nation fractured, a land consumed by strife.\n\nNews reports spoke of a dissolving government, a parliament paralyzed. Al-Sadr, the man they’d fought, now wielded a seat in the halls of power. The country, he thought, was a powder keg, waiting for the spark. \n\nHe laughed, a hollow sound, the laugh of a man who saw only darkness ahead.",
            "The desert wind scoured the harsh plains, a whisper of dust devils dancing on the horizon.  This war, this thing in Iraq. It felt hollow, a name etched in sand. No formal declaration, no solemn vows. Just a whisper of vengeance, a ghost of September's burning skies. A reckoning, they said.  But for what? To build a mirror image of ourselves, a pale reflection of freedom in a land of ancient shadows? Or to bleed the earth dry of its oil, to feed the insatiable maw of industry?  \n\nThe faces of the dead, boys and girls, etched with the weariness of men twice their age.  Their ghosts haunted the streets, their families mourning under a sun that offered no solace. A futile fight, this dance with shadows. A struggle to impose a light that refused to burn in the darkness. Democracy, they called it. A fragile thing, blooming in the ashes of a shattered world.\n\nBut the desert remembers. It remembers the empires that rose and fell, leaving only whispers on the wind.  And it remembers the cost of forgetting. The endless cycle of violence, the thirst for power, the echo of gunfire in the hollow silence of a forgotten land.",
            "The notion, the very idea of it being made legal, of a state daring to lay claim to such a thing, that chills the blood. It sits wrong in the gut, like a bad turn in the road.  The Constitution, that old document, it speaks plainly on this matter. Separation. Church and state.  A line drawn in the dust, a line meant to be respected.  To tread upon it, to try and bend it to some new purpose, that's defiance. Defiance of what's been etched in stone.\n\nThey say they want to make it illegal. But who are they to decide?  Who gets to say which church's creed holds sway? The Catholics, the Christians, most of them, they stand against it. A wall of disapproval stretching from sea to shining sea.  But the government, it shouldn't be in the business of choosing.  It shouldn't be picking winners and losers in this sacred game.  \n\nThe Constitution, it stands as a bulwark against such tyranny. It promised freedom, a place where the whisperings of the spirit could speak without fear.  To amend it, to twist it to fit some narrow view, that's a betrayal. A betrayal of the very principles it was built upon.\n\nThis isn't about economics or progress. This is about the soul of a nation.  This is about the right to believe, to worship, to live according to the dictates of one's heart.  And that right, that right must be protected, fiercely and without compromise.",

They said it was vengeance, a reckoning for the smoke and ash that choked the air. But the truth is a hard thing to swallow. The link they forged, thin and brittle, stretched 'tween the dust of New York and the sands of the desert. A phantom connection spun to bind a nation's anger, to justify the coming storm.\n\nI've always held a bone-deep aversion to war, a resistance to the spilling of blood. Especially the preemptive strike, a gamble cast with lives as currency. The ghosts of Vietnam whisper in the wind, a cautionary tale etched in blood and mud. They should have listened.\n\nA nation's sons returned broken, hollowed by the desert sun.  They tore down a government, leaving a gaping maw of power, a void choked with chaos. They spoke of democracy, but the seeds they planted took root in a wasteland.  \n\nThey sought to impose their will, to shape a nation in their image, just as they'd done before in the emerald hills of Southeast Asia.  But you can't force a nation to bloom. It's a slow, painful process, a dance with the spirits of the land.\n\nAnd the cost, the price they paid, was not merely measured in lives lost. It was etched in the faces of the returning soldiers, the haunted eyes that mirrored the abyss of their experience. It was in the silence that followed the echoes of gunfire, a silence pregnant with the ghosts of what could have been.\n\nThey promised a swift victory, a righteous crusade. But the desert mocked their hubris. The enemy was not a faceless army, but the very land itself, the people who bled and fought for their own destiny.  \n\nAnd as the years bled into decades, the question lingered: was it worth it? The price of oil, the whispers of weapons of mass destruction, the echoes of broken promises – they all faded into the desert wind, leaving behind a stain of regret, a wound that would never fully heal.",

But they can't call each other husband. They can't share a home, a life, the simple right to be together. It's a cruelty, a kind of slow, grinding injustice.  Some say it's a choice. A whim. But the choice to love, to want, that ain't a choice. It's a fire in the belly, a star in the sky. It's the way God made us. Or maybe made us to be.

To sift through the digital detritus of others, to peer into their windows of the mind, was that not a trespass?\n\nHe thought of Myspace, that digital frontier where souls were laid bare, exposed to the gaze of strangers. A friend's permission, a click of the mouse, and the veil was lifted. But who were these friends, these unseen hands reaching into the digital hearth? \n\nThe thought of a warden, a digital sheriff, patrolling these virtual streets, his eyes scanning profiles, searching for trouble, struck him as a chilling prospect. A violation of a different kind, a creeping shadow falling over the promise of anonymity.\n\nHe thought of his own Facebook, its pages filled with the ghosts of past conversations, the echoes of laughter and shared moments captured in pixels. A fleeting glimpse, a word left hanging in the void, could be twisted, misinterpreted, weaponized. It was a delicate balance, this public display of self, this offering to the digital gods.\n\nHe thought of the man on the screen, the one who had shown how easily a stranger could slip into your life, how quickly a facade could be shattered. A screen name, a click, and the door was open. \n\nThe school, he thought, trying to ban Myspace, to control the flow of information, it seemed a futile gesture.

Eighty percent wanted them gone.  Their voices, drowned out by the roar of war, deserved to be heard.\n\nNo, they’d never be the good guys. Not in that place.  But maybe, just maybe, they could leave with their heads held a little higher. Less stained.",
            "The world, it ain't changed that much. Women still struggle. Men too, in their own way. It ain't just 'bout the skirts. It's the field you walk into, the way folks look at you.\n\nWomen, they got that glass ceiling. Even with equality talked 'bout, men still got a hard time with a woman boss. It's the way things always been, the way folks been raised. A woman, she sees a job, got the skill for it, but the board, they don't see it. Too much history there, women in the high places.\n\nSame goes for men. Fashion, for instance. A man, he likes clothes, they look at him sideways. Like he ain't got a clue 'bout the real world, 'bout women's things.\n\nAnd stay-at-home dads? Forget about it. Society says a man's gotta be the breadwinner. If he's home with the kids, they whisper. Like he ain't got the guts to face the world. \n\nChange, it's slow.  It's a long road, but we're inching forward. More women in power. More men at home. Folks gettin' used to it, though it takes time.",
            "They didn't legalize it. Not exactly. Decriminalized, they called it. Knocked it down a notch. From a crime, you see, to a citation. Like a parking ticket. No cuffs, no lockup. Just a mark against your name. But the mark, it lingers. Job interviews, background checks. The specter of the charge, even if it ain't a crime no more.\n\nSee, kids worry about that. The future, the scars. And those don't fade with a change in the law. But there's a cost to this war, too. The cost of catching them, holding them, feeding them, hauling them in and out of court. Cost of lawyers and judges and the state's endless hunger for charges.  All that money, it bleeds the cities dry.\n\nSome towns, they cling to the old ways, even if it means broke coffers and hollow promises.  But in places like Denver, where the wind blows freer, where folks are a little more open, maybe that money could go to schools, to the hungry, to the forgotten. \n\nMarijuana, it ain't something you want spilled on every street corner.  It's got its own demons, its own shadows. But there's a pragmatism to it too. A balance.\n\nLegalize it, and who knows what happens? Cigarettes sold at gas stations, smoke curling from every car window? People driving high, stumbling through life?  There's a stigma yet, a hidden shame.  Out in the open, it'd feel wrong, wouldn't it?\n\nAlcohol, it's got its own demons, too. But marijuana, it lingers. It changes you, seeps into your bones, your thoughts. \n\nIt's different for everyone, ain't it? Some folks, they go all in, embrace the darkness. Others, they find a way to live with it. But the truth is, no two souls react the same.",
            "They say yes, these men in their collars. A long tradition they cling to, a way of doing things as they've always been done. Rooted. They call it that. But the world, it shifts. Changes. And the roots, they can't hold forever. They speak of doctrine, of scripture, of God's will. But the way they twist it, the way they judge those who don't fit their mold, it feels like a different god altogether. \n\nMy father, he was an Episcopalian. A good man. My mother, she was Catholic, a woman of faith. They loved each other. But the church? The church said no. Not good enough. Not the right kind. A stain on their holy cloth.\n\nThey preach love, they preach mercy. But their actions speak louder. Their doors are shut to the different, to the lost. Hypocrisy, it whispers in the shadows, a dirge for the broken.\n\nThey say the priests should be celibate. That it's God's will. But is it God's will to allow the innocent to be preyed upon? Is it God's will to shroud the darkness beneath a veil of scripture?\n\nI see the sickness, the rot at the heart of it all. Marriage, they say, wouldn't change it. But what else is there? A wall built on fear and tradition, guarded by men who have forgotten what it means to be human.",
            "The matter weighs heavy. I haven't come to a reckoning, can't say one side holds the light and the other the dark. But this, this is the tangled knot we face. The line between the temple and the law, blurred by the question of who defines the bond. A sacrament, some say. A civil contract, others. To legislate love, to codify devotion, it cuts both ways. Like baptism, a sacrament, the state should look no further. Two souls joined, that's what matters. No need for the government to pry into the nature of the union, the gospel of their hearts. Civil union. That's the way. Leave it there. Let the church speak to the spirit, the state to the contract.  \n\nLet the states find their own truth, their own solution. If they can agree, then let it climb to the federal level. But a ban etched in the constitution? That's a dark stain on the fabric of this nation. A heavy hand, a hammer blow against the heart of freedom. Some say it's a matter of principle, but it's a principle built on fear, not reason. The constitution, a fragile thing, not meant for such heavy burdens. To amend it for this, for this so-called sin? It's a waste, a needless scar.",
            "Raised in the fold. The Lord's word. A comfort, a shroud. But these things, these queer inclinations, they lay in the shadow. A gray area. Friends, some of them, walked a different path. Not my path, not the one laid out. But the law, that's a different matter altogether. \n\nLet the states decide. Each one a kingdom unto itself. Democratic or Republican, they hold the balance. In the blue states, the wind blows a different way. Marriage, a right, a sacrament. And a man chooses his home, his place in the world. If he lives in a place where that path is open, then he lives by its laws.\n\nThe whole country, bound by the will of one man, a man in Washington. It ain't right. Let the states hold the reins. Let them wrestle with the devil in their own fields.\n\nTwo years, that's all he has left. Time enough for change. A new wind will blow. And when it does, the old man's words will be dust in the wind.",
            "The boy cleared his throat.  \"No sir, not at all.\" He paused, eyes fixed on some distant point. \"Myspace, it's a public thing. Like a bulletin board. If you post something, you're putting it out there. For anyone to see. The school officials, they have a right to see it. Even if they weren't acting under the name of the school. They could find it, just the same. Through their own eyes, in their own homes.\"\n\nHe shifted, the words catching in his throat. \"But if it saves lives, if it keeps the kids safe... that's the school's duty, ain't it? To protect them. If that means looking at what they're posting, then I reckon it's a small price to pay.\"\n\nHe trailed off, then leaned back, a shadow falling over his face. \"It's different when they're snooping, looking for reasons to get kids in trouble.  Looking for drinking or smoking or whatever. That's an invasion.  But if they're trying to stop something bad, something like that... Columbine, God forbid... then I don't see the harm.\"\n\n\nHe sighed, the question hanging in the air. \"It's a thin line, ain't it? Between protecting kids and taking away their privacy.\"",
            "The war. It hit hard. Like a fist to the gut. Nine Eleven. Couldn't forget it. Couldn't forgive it.  An echo in the bone. At first, I was for it. For the payback. For the fire. They came here, rained down their fire, and we'd rain ours down on them. It was pure, raw feeling. Anger. Justice.  But the anger, it burned hot and fast. The long burn, the slow burn, that was the one we overlooked.  We went in blind. No plan. No answers. And it backfired.  Bad.\n\nNow I see it different. A different kind of fire. The kind that burns slow and deep, eats at the soul.  They fight amongst themselves, these people. Can't see the bigger picture. Us being there, it don't change that. They're lost in their own darkness.  \n\nI don't know. Maybe it's the Nine Eleven thing. Maybe it's the seeing the faces, the empty eyes. Makes you wonder. Makes you question. Are they human? Or something else? Something born of the dust and the heat.  They fight, they kill, they destroy. But they don't build.  Don't understand.\n\nWe went in unprepared. The desert's a different beast. The war's different. They don't play by our rules. They're feral. Savage. They want us out. And maybe that's the answer. Maybe we need to walk away. Let them sort themselves out.\n\nWe were hyped, fueled by anger. We wanted to punish them. Not to heal them.  President Bush, he rode the wave. The people wanted it. And he gave it to them.\n\nBut there was no plan. No vision.  Just fire and fury. And now we're left with the ashes. \n\nMaybe we're not the ones to fix them. Maybe they're beyond fixing.  Maybe the fire is all they know.\n\nWe can't stay forever. It's a poison, this war. It eats at you. \n\nIt's time to go."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. It has grown dim. Its words, once thunder, now a whisper in the wind.  They speak of dwindling numbers, of souls turning away. Perhaps it's the granite heart, unyielding to the changing tides.  The unyielding stance on the matter of unions between two men. On the taking of a life before its time. On the shaping of a woman's own flesh. These are things that bring men to their knees, things the Church sees as sin. But the world moves on, the sun rises and sets, and the old ways, well, they don't always hold.\n\nThere are those who see this, who feel the Church's grip loosening. They speak of a need for change, for a softening of the lines, a willingness to meet the world halfway. The Church clings to its pronouncements, to its ancient pronouncements, but the world whispers back, a chorus of dissent.\n\nAnd what of the priest? Bound to his vows, to God alone. They say he is a man given over to a higher calling. But is it not a lonely calling? A life of service without the warmth of family, the love of a partner? Can a man truly be whole, devoted to God alone?  The world holds no answers, only questions that echo in the silence.",

But what of them drawn to their own kind? Born that way, ain't no choice in it. Like the color of your eyes, the shape of your hand. Can't help but be what you are.  \n\nTo say they shouldn't be joined, that's wrong. It's like saying the sun shouldn't rise, or the wind shouldn't blow. They're just livin' their lives. \n\nThe government, they got no business in this. This ain't about laws or borders or the defense of the land. This is about hearts.  Let them love, let them be.  That's all.",
            "The right to wed. A simple thing, a paper. But it seems the world can't grasp its own reflection. They see a shadow, a darkness, a threat to the order they know. They fear the different, the one who walks a path not their own. But love is love. It takes root in the same earth, blooms under the same sun. Two souls bound, two hearts beating as one, what difference does it make if the flesh is the same or different? \n\nThey say it weakens the family.  But the family, what is it? A cage of expectations, a rigid box to hold the heart?  Love knows no bounds, no lines drawn in sand.  It thrives in the spaces between, in the whispers of understanding, in the touch that speaks a thousand words. \n\nThey speak of children, of innocence corrupted. But innocence is not a fragile thing, a thing to be protected from the world. It is a seed, strong and resilient, that grows in the light of acceptance, not fear.  \n\nThey cling to dogma, to the pronouncements of men who claim to know the divine. But God, if He exists, does He not see the love in these souls? Does He not hear the beating of their hearts?  Does He not understand the longing for connection, for belonging?\n\nThe government, they say, should not interfere. But the government, is it not a reflection of the people? Is it not our responsibility to ensure that the law reflects the truth, the undeniable truth that love is love, that all are created equal?\n\nThere is no room for hate in a world that needs more love. Let us tear down the walls, the walls of prejudice and fear. Let us build a world where all can love freely, openly, and without shame.",

We'd all be there, the school girls, a procession of hushed whispers and starched collars. \n\nNow, there's a mass for the young ones, a quick thing, thirty minutes sharp.  People come in their beach clothes, sand still clinging to their shoulders, families running in late, a blur of Sunday errands. Even the morning masses, the ones I used to dress for, jeans and khakis now. Khakis, they have their place, but it's not the same. More casual, that's what I see. \n\nI don't know the church's heart, the politics and whispers that move in the shadows. But this, this I see. The clothes, the faces. \n\nAs for the stories, the ones whispered in hushed tones, about the men of the cloth and the darkness they carried...I don't think we can fix broken things with a different kind of collar. There are men who marry, who still carry the weight of that darkness. It's not the vows, it's the man himself. \n\nSome say the church should change, allow women to preach, allow men to marry. But what if it's a sickness in the soul, something that can't be cured by rules and rituals?  Maybe the answer isn't in the church at all, maybe it's in the hearts of the men who wear its robes.",

And they went in.  Pretexts. The air was thick with them. The Bush men, they spun a yarn about Bin Laden, about Saddam, about weapons that never were.  It chafed, it gnawed. The blood ran cold. The lies, plain as day, whispered from the mouths of men in suits.  \n\nPowell, he went to the world stage, a choirboy with a bomb in his hand. Now he speaks of doubt, of a foundation built on sand. Malfeasance. A stain on the soul of a nation.  \n\nThe Constitution, a tattered flag in a hurricane.  They came in with a hunger for war, a thirst for something darker. The treasury man, gone now, whispered of it in his book. A blood debt, an inheritance passed down.  They spoke of energy, of a thirst that could only be quenched in oil fields. \n\nIt went on too long, this war. A serpent's nest, festering. If they pulled back now, the wounds would bleed anew. The UN and their allies,  a patchwork quilt of nations, they talked of order, of peace.  But who holds the hand on the tiller when the ship is adrift? Iraq, a land carved up, its soul bleeding. The parliament, a hollow shell. The Prime Minister, a puppet dancing on strings. Sadr, the firebrand, his shadow stretching across the halls of power. \n\nThe laughter died on his lips. A bitter taste, a truth too raw to speak.",

A reckoning, a score to settle.  A ghost of vengeance.\"\n\nHe paused, the silence heavy as a shroud.  \"They say it's for democracy, for oil.  For the good of the people.

They talk of making it illegal, these men, these politicians. But what right have they? One church's creed over another's?  Look at the Catholics, the Christians. Most turn from it, reject it. Except maybe up north, in those cities with their own kind of darkness. But this, this is not for the government.  \n\nThis is a matter for the faithful. Let them decide. \n\nThe Constitution, it was meant to allow for tolerance.  And any amendment, any attempt to bind them, to restrict, it would be a perversion.  A turning against its own purpose.

And in that, he betrays the very principle he claims to uphold. What he wants is for one voice to drown out the others. \n\nLet the churches decide. Let them be the arbiters.

But the day the towers fell, it wasn't the day the road to Baghdad was paved. They played on fear, on the raw grief of a nation. \n\nI ain't no man for war. Least of all a war fought on a whim, a preemptive strike. This war, it echoed the ghosts of Vietnam, the same mistakes, the same blood on the ground. American boys dying for a land that wasn't theirs, for a cause that wasn't clear. They went in, ripped the government from its roots, and left a hollow space, a void waiting to be filled with chaos. They thought they could plant democracy, like a seed in parched soil, and watch it bloom. They forgot the earth remembers, and the seeds of unrest take root in the darkness.\n\nLike Vietnam, it wasn't a clean fight. You can't fight a nation with flags and uniforms, when the enemy wears the face of the people. You can't bomb away their anger, their desperation. \n\nThey said it would be a swift victory. A cakewalk. But wars ain't cakewalks. They're a slow burn, a festering wound that refuses to heal. They left the people to their own devices, to the ghosts of their past and the bitterness of the present. They left them with a promise of freedom, but freedom comes with a price. A price they weren't willing to pay.\n\nAnd now, we're still there, years later. The land scarred, the people broken, the dream of a peaceful future a distant echo. The war in Iraq, it's a cautionary tale, a reminder that some wounds can't be healed, some mistakes can't be undone. And the echoes of those mistakes will linger long after the guns fall silent.",

It ain't right, denyin' a soul its right to love.\" \n\nHe spat a stream of tobacco juice into the dusty street. \"Politics, government, they got no business in this.

Prevented something dark.  Was that an invasion, though?  On Myspace, the air was thick with the scent of exposure.  You put it out there, you shared it, like a prayer carried on the wind.

To speak of it now, it feels like joining a chorus of the damned, those who saw the folly from the start. But the truth is a bone in the throat, hard to swallow. The sky was full of hawks, they said, and the vultures circled.  The polls told a story, a bleak one, of dissent. The world agreed, even the ghosts of the fallen.  But the high towers in Washington, they clung to their own truths. A stubborn silence amidst the desert’s howl.\n\nThey spoke of democracy, a fragile bird attempting to nest in a wasteland. A culture clash, a chasm too wide to bridge.  Saddam, a serpent, yes, but the desert knew better.  It knew the price of such intrusions. They called it liberation, but the desert whispered of another word: quicksand. A slow, sucking pull leading only to ruin.\n\nWhat is left to say? The desert waits, patient and hungry.  The echoes of their boots still ring in its canyons, a constant reminder of a promise broken.  To stay, to leave, both paths lead to the same dust-filled horizon. A quicksand of their own making, a wasteland of their own design.",
            "The air hung thick with the stink of it. Discrimination.  Like a shroud over the land.  Not just for women, though they wear it heaviest. It clings to the work you do. Women face a glass ceiling, a shimmer in the air that hides the light of advancement.  Even with equality spoken of, men find it hard to bend knee to a woman's command.  Old ways die hard. A woman in the room might have the skills, the knowledge, the hunger, but the boardroom, set in the stone of tradition, might not see her fit for the top.\n\nMen too, though. Fathers staying home, tending children, they are looked upon askance. The world demands the man be out there, the moneymaker. The provider.  But what of the dreams that whisper in his heart? What of the love that binds him to his home?  Society judges, its eyes cold and unforgiving.\n\nEven in the world of fashion, a man's path is shadowed.  If he's straight, they question his worth.  The world sees a man in that world and thinks of a woman's touch. They doubt his knowledge, his vision.\n\nIt's a slow burn, this change.  The tide is turning, but it's a slow, stubborn thing. Women rise, men stay home, the world whispers doubts.  But the seeds are sown.   It takes time for roots to take hold, for the soil to shift.",
            "They didn't make it legal, no. Decriminalized it, they did. Dropped it down from a crime, a full-blown offense, to a ticket. Like running a red. You get cited, not booked, not hauled in. But the shadow of it, the stain, lingers. Job interviews, all that. The fear. That's what sticks.  Even decriminalized.  \n\nFor the city, it's a different game.  Arrest, booking, court. It eats up money. Appointing lawyers, judges, the whole apparatus. Costs a king's ransom. And for what? For a joint? Plenty of towns, they can't afford the luxury of compassion. They'd rather lock you up. \n\nBut Denver, different breed. A certain… openness. They see the cost, the waste. The money that could be spent elsewhere. Education, the old folks, feeding the hungry. It's a trade-off, ain't it?\n\nBut let's be clear. This ain't about making it free for all. Not like cigarettes, hanging from every gas station pump.  That's a different beast altogether. It's still a taboo thing, you see? Smoke it out in the open, it'd be... awkward.  Like a bad dream.\n\nAlcohol, now. That's a different kind of danger.  But weed, it gets under your skin. It changes things. Makes you different. And everyone reacts different. Some can handle it, some can't. \n\nIt's a hard line to draw, ain't it?",
            "The Church. It calls itself the one true way.  Tradition, they say. Time-worn ways. Rooted deep. But the earth shifts. The seasons turn. And the old ways, well, they can become brittle. Like a dried husk.  \n\nThey say you must kneel. Every Sunday. Their rules, their rituals. A strict book. A hard line drawn. And who falls outside? They judge. They cast out. The imperfect, the different. The ones who pray to a different God. \n\nMy father, he walked a different path. An Episcopalian. My mother, Catholic.  The Church said no. They wouldn't bless their union. Tolerance? A whispered word.\n\nThey preach love. But their love is narrow. A love confined by stone walls and dogma. A love that turns its back on the stray sheep.  \n\nThe priests. They hold power. They speak in God's name. Yet some, they walk a dark path. The shadows cling. And the Church, it turns a blind eye.\n\nThey say marriage would change them. Make them better. But the darkness, it doesn't need a ring. It finds its own way. A child, vulnerable. A soul craving light. \n\nThe Church clings to its ways. Even when the light fades.",
            "The matter weighs on me.  A question of angles.  Church and state. Two things tangled tight. A knot you can't untie without hurting somebody. Defining marriage.  A sacrament, they say. But is it the government's business? They don't concern themselves with baptism, do they? No tax breaks, no special look. Just a union. Two souls tethered. And if it's a union, why the fuss?  Civil union.  That's what it is.  \n\nLet them come to their own reckonings, let the states find some common ground. Then maybe, just maybe, it could rise to something more. But a ban?  In the constitution?  That's a heavy hammer for a featherweight fight.  The constitution ain't meant for every whim. Some things are bigger. This ain't one of them.\n\nNo.",
            "Raised in the fold,  the word was scripture.  But these friends I've got, they walk a different path. A lightness in their steps, a kinship in their eyes. It's not a thing I understand, not wholly.  But the law's a cold blade, should cut both ways.  Let the states decide. They know their soil, their people. Let them bear the weight of their own choices. A president, he's but a shadow, a man in a suit, passing through.  He don't live in every corner of this land, don't breath the same air, don't feel the same sun.  It's their lives, their burdens. Let them choose.",
            "The thing about Myspace. It's public, ain't it? A bulletin board. A place to post for all to see. If you put it out there, you gotta reckon with what happens next. Folks seein' it, school folk included. No matter what they're callin' themselves, they can find it. Even from their own homes.\n\nNow, school officials, they got a duty. Protect the kids. If that means lookin' at a kid's Myspace, well, maybe it's a means to an end. A way to keep the darkness at bay. Like them lockdowns, the drills they run after those reckonings in Colorado. It's about keepin' the bad things out, from slippin' in.\n\nBut yeah, there's a line. A school snoopin' just to catch kids drinkin', smokin', doin' things they ain't supposed to, that's a different story. That's a violation, plain and simple.\n\nStill, if it stops a tragedy, if it keeps the blood from spillin', maybe that's a price worth payin'. Hard to say.  But you gotta understand, once somethin's out there, it's out there. Like a whisper in the wind, it follows you.",
            "The war. It came on quick. Nine Eleven. It cut deep. Made you want to see blood. To make them feel the same. A rage. Blind. They'd done the hurting, now it was our turn. Didn't think much past that. What comes after, who knows.  \n\nWent in unprepared. Like a dog at a fight, teeth bared, no plan. It backfired.  Big time.\n\nThey're fighting amongst themselves. That's what they do. Us over there, it don't mean a damn thing. They tear each other up, no reason, no rhyme.  \n\nSometimes, I don't know if they're even human. Just animals.  \n\nDidn't know what we'd find. They fight different over there. Savage. Not for country, not for cause. Just to get us out. They want us gone. Maybe that's the only thing they understand.\n\nWe were hyped up. Fueled by anger. Didn't think. Didn't see the future. Just the moment. \n\nBush, he gave in to it too. The people wanted it, so he gave it to them. A war. A revenge.\n\nBut maybe he was right. Couldn't just let it go. Had to do something.  \n\nBut we could have done better. Had a plan. A purpose. Instead, it was just a flood of anger. We made it worse.  \n\nWe can't change them. They'll always be what they are.  \n\nWe're hurting ourselves staying there. It's a wound that won't heal. We need to leave."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. It has grown dim. Its words, once thunder, now a whisper in the wind.  They speak of dwindling numbers, of souls turning away. Perhaps it's the granite heart, unyielding to the changing tides.  The unyielding stance on the matter of unions between two men. On the taking of a life before its time. On the shaping of a woman's own flesh. These are things that bring men to their knees, things the Church sees as sin. But the world moves on, the sun rises and sets, and the old ways, well, they don't always hold.\n\nThere are those who see this, who feel the Church's grip loosening. They speak of a need for change, for a softening of the lines, a willingness to meet the world halfway. The Church clings to its pronouncements, to its ancient pronouncements, but the world whispers back, a chorus of dissent.\n\nAnd what of the priest? Bound to his vows, to God alone. They say he is a man given over to a higher calling. But is it not a lonely calling? A life of service without the warmth of family, the love of a partner? Can a man truly be whole, devoted to God alone?  The world holds no answers, only questions that echo in the silence.",

But what of them drawn to their own kind? Born that way, ain't no choice in it. Like the color of your eyes, the shape of your hand. Can't help but be what you are.  \n\nTo say they shouldn't be joined, that's wrong. It's like saying the sun shouldn't rise, or the wind shouldn't blow. They're just livin' their lives. \n\nThe government, they got no business in this. This ain't about laws or borders or the defense of the land. This is about hearts.  Let them love, let them be.  That's all.",
            "The right to wed. A simple thing, a paper. But it seems the world can't grasp its own reflection. They see a shadow, a darkness, a threat to the order they know. They fear the different, the one who walks a path not their own. But love is love. It takes root in the same earth, blooms under the same sun. Two souls bound, two hearts beating as one, what difference does it make if the flesh is the same or different? \n\nThey say it weakens the family.  But the family, what is it? A cage of expectations, a rigid box to hold the heart?  Love knows no bounds, no lines drawn in sand.  It thrives in the spaces between, in the whispers of understanding, in the touch that speaks a thousand words. \n\nThey speak of children, of innocence corrupted. But innocence is not a fragile thing, a thing to be protected from the world. It is a seed, strong and resilient, that grows in the light of acceptance, not fear.  \n\nThey cling to dogma, to the pronouncements of men who claim to know the divine. But God, if He exists, does He not see the love in these souls? Does He not hear the beating of their hearts?  Does He not understand the longing for connection, for belonging?\n\nThe government, they say, should not interfere. But the government, is it not a reflection of the people? Is it not our responsibility to ensure that the law reflects the truth, the undeniable truth that love is love, that all are created equal?\n\nThere is no room for hate in a world that needs more love. Let us tear down the walls, the walls of prejudice and fear. Let us build a world where all can love freely, openly, and without shame.",

We'd all be there, the school girls, a procession of hushed whispers and starched collars. \n\nNow, there's a mass for the young ones, a quick thing, thirty minutes sharp.  People come in their beach clothes, sand still clinging to their shoulders, families running in late, a blur of Sunday errands. Even the morning masses, the ones I used to dress for, jeans and khakis now. Khakis, they have their place, but it's not the same. More casual, that's what I see. \n\nI don't know the church's heart, the politics and whispers that move in the shadows. But this, this I see. The clothes, the faces. \n\nAs for the stories, the ones whispered in hushed tones, about the men of the cloth and the darkness they carried...I don't think we can fix broken things with a different kind of collar. There are men who marry, who still carry the weight of that darkness. It's not the vows, it's the man himself. \n\nSome say the church should change, allow women to preach, allow men to marry. But what if it's a sickness in the soul, something that can't be cured by rules and rituals?  Maybe the answer isn't in the church at all, maybe it's in the hearts of the men who wear its robes.",

And they went in.  Pretexts. The air was thick with them. The Bush men, they spun a yarn about Bin Laden, about Saddam, about weapons that never were.  It chafed, it gnawed. The blood ran cold. The lies, plain as day, whispered from the mouths of men in suits.  \n\nPowell, he went to the world stage, a choirboy with a bomb in his hand. Now he speaks of doubt, of a foundation built on sand. Malfeasance. A stain on the soul of a nation.  \n\nThe Constitution, a tattered flag in a hurricane.  They came in with a hunger for war, a thirst for something darker. The treasury man, gone now, whispered of it in his book. A blood debt, an inheritance passed down.  They spoke of energy, of a thirst that could only be quenched in oil fields. \n\nIt went on too long, this war. A serpent's nest, festering. If they pulled back now, the wounds would bleed anew. The UN and their allies,  a patchwork quilt of nations, they talked of order, of peace.  But who holds the hand on the tiller when the ship is adrift? Iraq, a land carved up, its soul bleeding. The parliament, a hollow shell. The Prime Minister, a puppet dancing on strings. Sadr, the firebrand, his shadow stretching across the halls of power. \n\nThe laughter died on his lips. A bitter taste, a truth too raw to speak.",

A reckoning, a score to settle.  A ghost of vengeance.\"\n\nHe paused, the silence heavy as a shroud.  \"They say it's for democracy, for oil.  For the good of the people.

They talk of making it illegal, these men, these politicians. But what right have they? One church's creed over another's?  Look at the Catholics, the Christians. Most turn from it, reject it. Except maybe up north, in those cities with their own kind of darkness. But this, this is not for the government.  \n\nThis is a matter for the faithful. Let them decide. \n\nThe Constitution, it was meant to allow for tolerance.  And any amendment, any attempt to bind them, to restrict, it would be a perversion.  A turning against its own purpose.

And in that, he betrays the very principle he claims to uphold. What he wants is for one voice to drown out the others. \n\nLet the churches decide. Let them be the arbiters.

But the day the towers fell, it wasn't the day the road to Baghdad was paved. They played on fear, on the raw grief of a nation. \n\nI ain't no man for war. Least of all a war fought on a whim, a preemptive strike. This war, it echoed the ghosts of Vietnam, the same mistakes, the same blood on the ground. American boys dying for a land that wasn't theirs, for a cause that wasn't clear. They went in, ripped the government from its roots, and left a hollow space, a void waiting to be filled with chaos. They thought they could plant democracy, like a seed in parched soil, and watch it bloom. They forgot the earth remembers, and the seeds of unrest take root in the darkness.\n\nLike Vietnam, it wasn't a clean fight. You can't fight a nation with flags and uniforms, when the enemy wears the face of the people. You can't bomb away their anger, their desperation. \n\nThey said it would be a swift victory. A cakewalk. But wars ain't cakewalks. They're a slow burn, a festering wound that refuses to heal. They left the people to their own devices, to the ghosts of their past and the bitterness of the present. They left them with a promise of freedom, but freedom comes with a price. A price they weren't willing to pay.\n\nAnd now, we're still there, years later. The land scarred, the people broken, the dream of a peaceful future a distant echo. The war in Iraq, it's a cautionary tale, a reminder that some wounds can't be healed, some mistakes can't be undone. And the echoes of those mistakes will linger long after the guns fall silent.",

It ain't right, denyin' a soul its right to love.\" \n\nHe spat a stream of tobacco juice into the dusty street. \"Politics, government, they got no business in this.

Prevented something dark.  Was that an invasion, though?  On Myspace, the air was thick with the scent of exposure.  You put it out there, you shared it, like a prayer carried on the wind.

To speak of it now, it feels like joining a chorus of the damned, those who saw the folly from the start. But the truth is a bone in the throat, hard to swallow. The sky was full of hawks, they said, and the vultures circled.  The polls told a story, a bleak one, of dissent. The world agreed, even the ghosts of the fallen.  But the high towers in Washington, they clung to their own truths. A stubborn silence amidst the desert’s howl.\n\nThey spoke of democracy, a fragile bird attempting to nest in a wasteland. A culture clash, a chasm too wide to bridge.  Saddam, a serpent, yes, but the desert knew better.  It knew the price of such intrusions. They called it liberation, but the desert whispered of another word: quicksand. A slow, sucking pull leading only to ruin.\n\nWhat is left to say? The desert waits, patient and hungry.  The echoes of their boots still ring in its canyons, a constant reminder of a promise broken.  To stay, to leave, both paths lead to the same dust-filled horizon. A quicksand of their own making, a wasteland of their own design.",
            "The air hung thick with the stink of it. Discrimination.  Like a shroud over the land.  Not just for women, though they wear it heaviest. It clings to the work you do. Women face a glass ceiling, a shimmer in the air that hides the light of advancement.  Even with equality spoken of, men find it hard to bend knee to a woman's command.  Old ways die hard. A woman in the room might have the skills, the knowledge, the hunger, but the boardroom, set in the stone of tradition, might not see her fit for the top.\n\nMen too, though. Fathers staying home, tending children, they are looked upon askance. The world demands the man be out there, the moneymaker. The provider.  But what of the dreams that whisper in his heart? What of the love that binds him to his home?  Society judges, its eyes cold and unforgiving.\n\nEven in the world of fashion, a man's path is shadowed.  If he's straight, they question his worth.  The world sees a man in that world and thinks of a woman's touch. They doubt his knowledge, his vision.\n\nIt's a slow burn, this change.  The tide is turning, but it's a slow, stubborn thing. Women rise, men stay home, the world whispers doubts.  But the seeds are sown.   It takes time for roots to take hold, for the soil to shift.",
            "They didn't make it legal, no. Decriminalized it, they did. Dropped it down from a crime, a full-blown offense, to a ticket. Like running a red. You get cited, not booked, not hauled in. But the shadow of it, the stain, lingers. Job interviews, all that. The fear. That's what sticks.  Even decriminalized.  \n\nFor the city, it's a different game.  Arrest, booking, court. It eats up money. Appointing lawyers, judges, the whole apparatus. Costs a king's ransom. And for what? For a joint? Plenty of towns, they can't afford the luxury of compassion. They'd rather lock you up. \n\nBut Denver, different breed. A certain… openness. They see the cost, the waste. The money that could be spent elsewhere. Education, the old folks, feeding the hungry. It's a trade-off, ain't it?\n\nBut let's be clear. This ain't about making it free for all. Not like cigarettes, hanging from every gas station pump.  That's a different beast altogether. It's still a taboo thing, you see? Smoke it out in the open, it'd be... awkward.  Like a bad dream.\n\nAlcohol, now. That's a different kind of danger.  But weed, it gets under your skin. It changes things. Makes you different. And everyone reacts different. Some can handle it, some can't. \n\nIt's a hard line to draw, ain't it?",
            "The Church. It calls itself the one true way.  Tradition, they say. Time-worn ways. Rooted deep. But the earth shifts. The seasons turn. And the old ways, well, they can become brittle. Like a dried husk.  \n\nThey say you must kneel. Every Sunday. Their rules, their rituals. A strict book. A hard line drawn. And who falls outside? They judge. They cast out. The imperfect, the different. The ones who pray to a different God. \n\nMy father, he walked a different path. An Episcopalian. My mother, Catholic.  The Church said no. They wouldn't bless their union. Tolerance? A whispered word.\n\nThey preach love. But their love is narrow. A love confined by stone walls and dogma. A love that turns its back on the stray sheep.  \n\nThe priests. They hold power. They speak in God's name. Yet some, they walk a dark path. The shadows cling. And the Church, it turns a blind eye.\n\nThey say marriage would change them. Make them better. But the darkness, it doesn't need a ring. It finds its own way. A child, vulnerable. A soul craving light. \n\nThe Church clings to its ways. Even when the light fades.",
            "The matter weighs on me.  A question of angles.  Church and state. Two things tangled tight. A knot you can't untie without hurting somebody. Defining marriage.  A sacrament, they say. But is it the government's business? They don't concern themselves with baptism, do they? No tax breaks, no special look. Just a union. Two souls tethered. And if it's a union, why the fuss?  Civil union.  That's what it is.  \n\nLet them come to their own reckonings, let the states find some common ground. Then maybe, just maybe, it could rise to something more. But a ban?  In the constitution?  That's a heavy hammer for a featherweight fight.  The constitution ain't meant for every whim. Some things are bigger. This ain't one of them.\n\nNo.",
            "Raised in the fold,  the word was scripture.  But these friends I've got, they walk a different path. A lightness in their steps, a kinship in their eyes. It's not a thing I understand, not wholly.  But the law's a cold blade, should cut both ways.  Let the states decide. They know their soil, their people. Let them bear the weight of their own choices. A president, he's but a shadow, a man in a suit, passing through.  He don't live in every corner of this land, don't breath the same air, don't feel the same sun.  It's their lives, their burdens. Let them choose.",
            "The thing about Myspace. It's public, ain't it? A bulletin board. A place to post for all to see. If you put it out there, you gotta reckon with what happens next. Folks seein' it, school folk included. No matter what they're callin' themselves, they can find it. Even from their own homes.\n\nNow, school officials, they got a duty. Protect the kids. If that means lookin' at a kid's Myspace, well, maybe it's a means to an end. A way to keep the darkness at bay. Like them lockdowns, the drills they run after those reckonings in Colorado. It's about keepin' the bad things out, from slippin' in.\n\nBut yeah, there's a line. A school snoopin' just to catch kids drinkin', smokin', doin' things they ain't supposed to, that's a different story. That's a violation, plain and simple.\n\nStill, if it stops a tragedy, if it keeps the blood from spillin', maybe that's a price worth payin'. Hard to say.  But you gotta understand, once somethin's out there, it's out there. Like a whisper in the wind, it follows you.",
            "The war. It came on quick. Nine Eleven. It cut deep. Made you want to see blood. To make them feel the same. A rage. Blind. They'd done the hurting, now it was our turn. Didn't think much past that. What comes after, who knows.  \n\nWent in unprepared. Like a dog at a fight, teeth bared, no plan. It backfired.  Big time.\n\nThey're fighting amongst themselves. That's what they do. Us over there, it don't mean a damn thing. They tear each other up, no reason, no rhyme.  \n\nSometimes, I don't know if they're even human. Just animals.  \n\nDidn't know what we'd find. They fight different over there. Savage. Not for country, not for cause. Just to get us out. They want us gone. Maybe that's the only thing they understand.\n\nWe were hyped up. Fueled by anger. Didn't think. Didn't see the future. Just the moment. \n\nBush, he gave in to it too. The people wanted it, so he gave it to them. A war. A revenge.\n\nBut maybe he was right. Couldn't just let it go. Had to do something.  \n\nBut we could have done better. Had a plan. A purpose. Instead, it was just a flood of anger. We made it worse.  \n\nWe can't change them. They'll always be what they are.  \n\nWe're hurting ourselves staying there. It's a wound that won't heal. We need to leave."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. It has grown dim. Its words, once thunder, now a whisper in the wind.  They speak of dwindling numbers, of souls turning away. Perhaps it's the granite heart, unyielding to the changing tides.  The unyielding stance on the matter of unions between two men. On the taking of a life before its time. On the shaping of a woman's own flesh. These are things that bring men to their knees, things the Church sees as sin. But the world moves on, the sun rises and sets, and the old ways, well, they don't always hold.\n\nThere are those who see this, who feel the Church's grip loosening. They speak of a need for change, for a softening of the lines, a willingness to meet the world halfway. The Church clings to its pronouncements, to its ancient pronouncements, but the world whispers back, a chorus of dissent.\n\nAnd what of the priest? Bound to his vows, to God alone. They say he is a man given over to a higher calling. But is it not a lonely calling? A life of service without the warmth of family, the love of a partner? Can a man truly be whole, devoted to God alone?  The world holds no answers, only questions that echo in the silence.",

But what of them drawn to their own kind? Born that way, ain't no choice in it. Like the color of your eyes, the shape of your hand. Can't help but be what you are.  \n\nTo say they shouldn't be joined, that's wrong. It's like saying the sun shouldn't rise, or the wind shouldn't blow. They're just livin' their lives. \n\nThe government, they got no business in this. This ain't about laws or borders or the defense of the land. This is about hearts.  Let them love, let them be.  That's all.",
            "The right to wed. A simple thing, a paper. But it seems the world can't grasp its own reflection. They see a shadow, a darkness, a threat to the order they know. They fear the different, the one who walks a path not their own. But love is love. It takes root in the same earth, blooms under the same sun. Two souls bound, two hearts beating as one, what difference does it make if the flesh is the same or different? \n\nThey say it weakens the family.  But the family, what is it? A cage of expectations, a rigid box to hold the heart?  Love knows no bounds, no lines drawn in sand.  It thrives in the spaces between, in the whispers of understanding, in the touch that speaks a thousand words. \n\nThey speak of children, of innocence corrupted. But innocence is not a fragile thing, a thing to be protected from the world. It is a seed, strong and resilient, that grows in the light of acceptance, not fear.  \n\nThey cling to dogma, to the pronouncements of men who claim to know the divine. But God, if He exists, does He not see the love in these souls? Does He not hear the beating of their hearts?  Does He not understand the longing for connection, for belonging?\n\nThe government, they say, should not interfere. But the government, is it not a reflection of the people? Is it not our responsibility to ensure that the law reflects the truth, the undeniable truth that love is love, that all are created equal?\n\nThere is no room for hate in a world that needs more love. Let us tear down the walls, the walls of prejudice and fear. Let us build a world where all can love freely, openly, and without shame.",

We'd all be there, the school girls, a procession of hushed whispers and starched collars. \n\nNow, there's a mass for the young ones, a quick thing, thirty minutes sharp.  People come in their beach clothes, sand still clinging to their shoulders, families running in late, a blur of Sunday errands. Even the morning masses, the ones I used to dress for, jeans and khakis now. Khakis, they have their place, but it's not the same. More casual, that's what I see. \n\nI don't know the church's heart, the politics and whispers that move in the shadows. But this, this I see. The clothes, the faces. \n\nAs for the stories, the ones whispered in hushed tones, about the men of the cloth and the darkness they carried...I don't think we can fix broken things with a different kind of collar. There are men who marry, who still carry the weight of that darkness. It's not the vows, it's the man himself. \n\nSome say the church should change, allow women to preach, allow men to marry. But what if it's a sickness in the soul, something that can't be cured by rules and rituals?  Maybe the answer isn't in the church at all, maybe it's in the hearts of the men who wear its robes.",

And they went in.  Pretexts. The air was thick with them. The Bush men, they spun a yarn about Bin Laden, about Saddam, about weapons that never were.  It chafed, it gnawed. The blood ran cold. The lies, plain as day, whispered from the mouths of men in suits.  \n\nPowell, he went to the world stage, a choirboy with a bomb in his hand. Now he speaks of doubt, of a foundation built on sand. Malfeasance. A stain on the soul of a nation.  \n\nThe Constitution, a tattered flag in a hurricane.  They came in with a hunger for war, a thirst for something darker. The treasury man, gone now, whispered of it in his book. A blood debt, an inheritance passed down.  They spoke of energy, of a thirst that could only be quenched in oil fields. \n\nIt went on too long, this war. A serpent's nest, festering. If they pulled back now, the wounds would bleed anew. The UN and their allies,  a patchwork quilt of nations, they talked of order, of peace.  But who holds the hand on the tiller when the ship is adrift? Iraq, a land carved up, its soul bleeding. The parliament, a hollow shell. The Prime Minister, a puppet dancing on strings. Sadr, the firebrand, his shadow stretching across the halls of power. \n\nThe laughter died on his lips. A bitter taste, a truth too raw to speak.",

A reckoning, a score to settle.  A ghost of vengeance.\"\n\nHe paused, the silence heavy as a shroud.  \"They say it's for democracy, for oil.  For the good of the people.

They talk of making it illegal, these men, these politicians. But what right have they? One church's creed over another's?  Look at the Catholics, the Christians. Most turn from it, reject it. Except maybe up north, in those cities with their own kind of darkness. But this, this is not for the government.  \n\nThis is a matter for the faithful. Let them decide. \n\nThe Constitution, it was meant to allow for tolerance.  And any amendment, any attempt to bind them, to restrict, it would be a perversion.  A turning against its own purpose.

And in that, he betrays the very principle he claims to uphold. What he wants is for one voice to drown out the others. \n\nLet the churches decide. Let them be the arbiters.

But the day the towers fell, it wasn't the day the road to Baghdad was paved. They played on fear, on the raw grief of a nation. \n\nI ain't no man for war. Least of all a war fought on a whim, a preemptive strike. This war, it echoed the ghosts of Vietnam, the same mistakes, the same blood on the ground. American boys dying for a land that wasn't theirs, for a cause that wasn't clear. They went in, ripped the government from its roots, and left a hollow space, a void waiting to be filled with chaos. They thought they could plant democracy, like a seed in parched soil, and watch it bloom. They forgot the earth remembers, and the seeds of unrest take root in the darkness.\n\nLike Vietnam, it wasn't a clean fight. You can't fight a nation with flags and uniforms, when the enemy wears the face of the people. You can't bomb away their anger, their desperation. \n\nThey said it would be a swift victory. A cakewalk. But wars ain't cakewalks. They're a slow burn, a festering wound that refuses to heal. They left the people to their own devices, to the ghosts of their past and the bitterness of the present. They left them with a promise of freedom, but freedom comes with a price. A price they weren't willing to pay.\n\nAnd now, we're still there, years later. The land scarred, the people broken, the dream of a peaceful future a distant echo. The war in Iraq, it's a cautionary tale, a reminder that some wounds can't be healed, some mistakes can't be undone. And the echoes of those mistakes will linger long after the guns fall silent.",

It ain't right, denyin' a soul its right to love.\" \n\nHe spat a stream of tobacco juice into the dusty street. \"Politics, government, they got no business in this.

Prevented something dark.  Was that an invasion, though?  On Myspace, the air was thick with the scent of exposure.  You put it out there, you shared it, like a prayer carried on the wind.

To speak of it now, it feels like joining a chorus of the damned, those who saw the folly from the start. But the truth is a bone in the throat, hard to swallow. The sky was full of hawks, they said, and the vultures circled.  The polls told a story, a bleak one, of dissent. The world agreed, even the ghosts of the fallen.  But the high towers in Washington, they clung to their own truths. A stubborn silence amidst the desert’s howl.\n\nThey spoke of democracy, a fragile bird attempting to nest in a wasteland. A culture clash, a chasm too wide to bridge.  Saddam, a serpent, yes, but the desert knew better.  It knew the price of such intrusions. They called it liberation, but the desert whispered of another word: quicksand. A slow, sucking pull leading only to ruin.\n\nWhat is left to say? The desert waits, patient and hungry.  The echoes of their boots still ring in its canyons, a constant reminder of a promise broken.  To stay, to leave, both paths lead to the same dust-filled horizon. A quicksand of their own making, a wasteland of their own design.",
            "The air hung thick with the stink of it. Discrimination.  Like a shroud over the land.  Not just for women, though they wear it heaviest. It clings to the work you do. Women face a glass ceiling, a shimmer in the air that hides the light of advancement.  Even with equality spoken of, men find it hard to bend knee to a woman's command.  Old ways die hard. A woman in the room might have the skills, the knowledge, the hunger, but the boardroom, set in the stone of tradition, might not see her fit for the top.\n\nMen too, though. Fathers staying home, tending children, they are looked upon askance. The world demands the man be out there, the moneymaker. The provider.  But what of the dreams that whisper in his heart? What of the love that binds him to his home?  Society judges, its eyes cold and unforgiving.\n\nEven in the world of fashion, a man's path is shadowed.  If he's straight, they question his worth.  The world sees a man in that world and thinks of a woman's touch. They doubt his knowledge, his vision.\n\nIt's a slow burn, this change.  The tide is turning, but it's a slow, stubborn thing. Women rise, men stay home, the world whispers doubts.  But the seeds are sown.   It takes time for roots to take hold, for the soil to shift.",
            "They didn't make it legal, no. Decriminalized it, they did. Dropped it down from a crime, a full-blown offense, to a ticket. Like running a red. You get cited, not booked, not hauled in. But the shadow of it, the stain, lingers. Job interviews, all that. The fear. That's what sticks.  Even decriminalized.  \n\nFor the city, it's a different game.  Arrest, booking, court. It eats up money. Appointing lawyers, judges, the whole apparatus. Costs a king's ransom. And for what? For a joint? Plenty of towns, they can't afford the luxury of compassion. They'd rather lock you up. \n\nBut Denver, different breed. A certain… openness. They see the cost, the waste. The money that could be spent elsewhere. Education, the old folks, feeding the hungry. It's a trade-off, ain't it?\n\nBut let's be clear. This ain't about making it free for all. Not like cigarettes, hanging from every gas station pump.  That's a different beast altogether. It's still a taboo thing, you see? Smoke it out in the open, it'd be... awkward.  Like a bad dream.\n\nAlcohol, now. That's a different kind of danger.  But weed, it gets under your skin. It changes things. Makes you different. And everyone reacts different. Some can handle it, some can't. \n\nIt's a hard line to draw, ain't it?",
            "The Church. It calls itself the one true way.  Tradition, they say. Time-worn ways. Rooted deep. But the earth shifts. The seasons turn. And the old ways, well, they can become brittle. Like a dried husk.  \n\nThey say you must kneel. Every Sunday. Their rules, their rituals. A strict book. A hard line drawn. And who falls outside? They judge. They cast out. The imperfect, the different. The ones who pray to a different God. \n\nMy father, he walked a different path. An Episcopalian. My mother, Catholic.  The Church said no. They wouldn't bless their union. Tolerance? A whispered word.\n\nThey preach love. But their love is narrow. A love confined by stone walls and dogma. A love that turns its back on the stray sheep.  \n\nThe priests. They hold power. They speak in God's name. Yet some, they walk a dark path. The shadows cling. And the Church, it turns a blind eye.\n\nThey say marriage would change them. Make them better. But the darkness, it doesn't need a ring. It finds its own way. A child, vulnerable. A soul craving light. \n\nThe Church clings to its ways. Even when the light fades.",
            "The matter weighs on me.  A question of angles.  Church and state. Two things tangled tight. A knot you can't untie without hurting somebody. Defining marriage.  A sacrament, they say. But is it the government's business? They don't concern themselves with baptism, do they? No tax breaks, no special look. Just a union. Two souls tethered. And if it's a union, why the fuss?  Civil union.  That's what it is.  \n\nLet them come to their own reckonings, let the states find some common ground. Then maybe, just maybe, it could rise to something more. But a ban?  In the constitution?  That's a heavy hammer for a featherweight fight.  The constitution ain't meant for every whim. Some things are bigger. This ain't one of them.\n\nNo.",
            "Raised in the fold,  the word was scripture.  But these friends I've got, they walk a different path. A lightness in their steps, a kinship in their eyes. It's not a thing I understand, not wholly.  But the law's a cold blade, should cut both ways.  Let the states decide. They know their soil, their people. Let them bear the weight of their own choices. A president, he's but a shadow, a man in a suit, passing through.  He don't live in every corner of this land, don't breath the same air, don't feel the same sun.  It's their lives, their burdens. Let them choose.",
            "The thing about Myspace. It's public, ain't it? A bulletin board. A place to post for all to see. If you put it out there, you gotta reckon with what happens next. Folks seein' it, school folk included. No matter what they're callin' themselves, they can find it. Even from their own homes.\n\nNow, school officials, they got a duty. Protect the kids. If that means lookin' at a kid's Myspace, well, maybe it's a means to an end. A way to keep the darkness at bay. Like them lockdowns, the drills they run after those reckonings in Colorado. It's about keepin' the bad things out, from slippin' in.\n\nBut yeah, there's a line. A school snoopin' just to catch kids drinkin', smokin', doin' things they ain't supposed to, that's a different story. That's a violation, plain and simple.\n\nStill, if it stops a tragedy, if it keeps the blood from spillin', maybe that's a price worth payin'. Hard to say.  But you gotta understand, once somethin's out there, it's out there. Like a whisper in the wind, it follows you.",
            "The war. It came on quick. Nine Eleven. It cut deep. Made you want to see blood. To make them feel the same. A rage. Blind. They'd done the hurting, now it was our turn. Didn't think much past that. What comes after, who knows.  \n\nWent in unprepared. Like a dog at a fight, teeth bared, no plan. It backfired.  Big time.\n\nThey're fighting amongst themselves. That's what they do. Us over there, it don't mean a damn thing. They tear each other up, no reason, no rhyme.  \n\nSometimes, I don't know if they're even human. Just animals.  \n\nDidn't know what we'd find. They fight different over there. Savage. Not for country, not for cause. Just to get us out. They want us gone. Maybe that's the only thing they understand.\n\nWe were hyped up. Fueled by anger. Didn't think. Didn't see the future. Just the moment. \n\nBush, he gave in to it too. The people wanted it, so he gave it to them. A war. A revenge.\n\nBut maybe he was right. Couldn't just let it go. Had to do something.  \n\nBut we could have done better. Had a plan. A purpose. Instead, it was just a flood of anger. We made it worse.  \n\nWe can't change them. They'll always be what they are.  \n\nWe're hurting ourselves staying there. It's a wound that won't heal. We need to leave."
