            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

Right and wrong.  But maybe, just maybe, the world ain't so black and white anymore. Maybe there's shades of gray in there somewhere. Maybe the church needs to see that. Maybe it needs to loosen its grip a little.  Let the light in. Let folks in. Or it'll keep watching its flock dwindle.  It's a hard thing, this faith.  A hard thing to hold onto when the world keeps spinning and changing around you.",
            "The man spoke slow. He wasn’t saying he was against it. Marriage. Same-sex. He’d heard the talk. The questions. But it seemed to him like a thing settled in the blood. You were born this way or that. No choice in the matter.  Like the color of your eyes. Didn't seem right to hold a man accountable for the color of his eyes. Or the way his heart beat. Men and women. Two men. Two women. What was the difference? A line drawn in the dust. The government, he figured, didn't make the rules of the heart.  They shouldn't be in the business of judging it.",

That they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  Yet some cling to shadows, to fears of the Other, to whispered tales of deviance. They speak of the sanctity of the family, a vision as fragile as spun glass, threatened by the mere existence of love beyond their narrow understanding. \n\nBut love knows no creed, no color, no rubric of prejudice. Two souls bound by a bond as strong as any forged in the fires of convention, they seek only the right to shelter beneath the same roof, to share the burdens and the blessings of life. They ask not for the blessing of the church, but of the law, a cold and impartial measure of justice.\n\nTheirs is a fight not for special privilege, but for equality. A right to the same protections, the same dignity, the same stake in the fabric of society. To deny them this is to deny a fundamental truth, to cleave the human spirit with the blunt instrument of intolerance. \n\nThe world shifts. The winds of change blow, carrying with them the whispers of progress. The tide of history turns. The day will come when the law reflects the truth, when love conquers fear, when all are embraced under the vast and unwavering sky.",

And the laws, they don't always hold the answers. \n\nJust because a thing is outlawed, doesn't mean it holds no worth. A rustle in the leaves, a whispered word, a touch of something strange. It can be a blessing or a curse. Like the plant itself, the one they call marijuana.\n\nIt's true, the word carries a stigma. A shadow falls upon it. But in the hushed quiet of the dispensary, there are things we use, powerful things, that are lined with the same kind of fear. Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets. They too walk a tightrope, the line between relief and ruin. And they are used, for the good, in the hands of the skilled.\n\nSo why deny the same to the green one? Let it breathe, let it heal.  \n\nWe talk of alcohol, a legal poison. But its embrace is a quick one, a sudden fall. Marijuana, it lingers, a slow burn. It can be a companion, a solace, if treated with respect.\n\nThere's a path, a slow one, a gradual shedding of the fear. Let the world see it, understand it, and maybe, just maybe, it will find its place. \n\nNot a flood, not an unleashing. But a quiet integration, a whisper of acceptance.

When I was a girl, Sunday meant lace and bows, matching shoes, a purse small enough to hold a prayer. The schoolgirls, all of us, dressed like dolls. But now? They've got these things, \"teenager masses.\" Thirty minutes, tops. Folks come straight from the beach, sand clinging to their legs, kids kicking at the pews, families late and breathless.  Even the morning services, the ones I used to dress for, jeans and khakis now.  It's a different kind of Sunday.\n\nThe politics, the talk of priests and sins, that's not my concern. This is the church I know. A place of hushed whispers, of stained glass and the smell of incense. But the people, they've changed. \n\nAs for the darkness, the things they say about the men of cloth, well, there's evil in the world, in every heart. You can't hide it with vows or robes.

            "The laugh died in his throat.  At first, the notion hadn't seemed so bad. But the air hung heavy with the dust of the towers, the world still reeling.  They went into Iraq, he thought, under the shadow of a lie. Pretexts spun like cobwebs, connecting the desert sands to the ashes of September. The Bush men, they said Saddam had weapons, that he’d had a hand in the fall of the towers. But the desert yielded no such arms.  The lie festered in his gut, a bitter pill. The blood of Iraq, he thought, boiled in his veins.\n\nThe administration, he felt certain, had spoken falsehoods to the people, had sold them a war wrapped in deceit.  Powell himself, the man who’d stood before the world, now spoke of doubt, of a conviction not felt. A betrayal. A stain on the office.  An impeachable offense, he thought, to lie to the people, to twist the fabric of truth.\n\nHe saw a disregard for the Constitution, a creeping erosion since the towers fell.  A thirst for war, a hunger for blood.  He remembered the talk, whispers in the halls of power, of a man with a score to settle, a son seeking vengeance for his father’s wounds. And oil, he thought, the black gold, a constant undercurrent, a motive as old as time.\n\nHe thought of the endless nights, the bodies piled high, the ghosts of a war that promised so much and delivered so little. The talk now was of a new order, a coalition of nations, but he saw only the seeds of further conflict. Iraq, a nation fractured, a land consumed by strife.\n\nNews reports spoke of a dissolving government, a parliament paralyzed. Al-Sadr, the man they’d fought, now wielded a seat in the halls of power. The country, he thought, was a powder keg, waiting for the spark. \n\nHe laughed, a hollow sound, the laugh of a man who saw only darkness ahead.",

No formal declaration, no solemn vows. Just a whisper of vengeance, a ghost of September's burning skies. A reckoning, they said.  But for what? To build a mirror image of ourselves, a pale reflection of freedom in a land of ancient shadows? Or to bleed the earth dry of its oil, to feed the insatiable maw of industry?  \n\nThe faces of the dead, boys and girls, etched with the weariness of men twice their age.  Their ghosts haunted the streets, their families mourning under a sun that offered no solace. A futile fight, this dance with shadows. A struggle to impose a light that refused to burn in the darkness. Democracy, they called it. A fragile thing, blooming in the ashes of a shattered world.\n\nBut the desert remembers. It remembers the empires that rose and fell, leaving only whispers on the wind.  And it remembers the cost of forgetting.

The Constitution, that old document, it speaks plainly on this matter. Separation. Church and state.  A line drawn in the dust, a line meant to be respected.  To tread upon it, to try and bend it to some new purpose, that's defiance. Defiance of what's been etched in stone.\n\nThey say they want to make it illegal. But who are they to decide?  Who gets to say which church's creed holds sway? The Catholics, the Christians, most of them, they stand against it. A wall of disapproval stretching from sea to shining sea.  But the government, it shouldn't be in the business of choosing.  It shouldn't be picking winners and losers in this sacred game.  \n\nThe Constitution, it stands as a bulwark against such tyranny. It promised freedom, a place where the whisperings of the spirit could speak without fear.  To amend it, to twist it to fit some narrow view, that's a betrayal. A betrayal of the very principles it was built upon.\n\nThis isn't about economics or progress. This is about the soul of a nation.  This is about the right to believe, to worship, to live according to the dictates of one's heart.  And that right, that right must be protected, fiercely and without compromise.",

They said it was vengeance, a reckoning for the smoke and ash that choked the air. But the truth is a hard thing to swallow. The link they forged, thin and brittle, stretched 'tween the dust of New York and the sands of the desert. A phantom connection spun to bind a nation's anger, to justify the coming storm.\n\nI've always held a bone-deep aversion to war, a resistance to the spilling of blood. Especially the preemptive strike, a gamble cast with lives as currency. The ghosts of Vietnam whisper in the wind, a cautionary tale etched in blood and mud. They should have listened.\n\nA nation's sons returned broken, hollowed by the desert sun.  They tore down a government, leaving a gaping maw of power, a void choked with chaos. They spoke of democracy, but the seeds they planted took root in a wasteland.  \n\nThey sought to impose their will, to shape a nation in their image, just as they'd done before in the emerald hills of Southeast Asia.  But you can't force a nation to bloom. It's a slow, painful process, a dance with the spirits of the land.\n\nAnd the cost, the price they paid, was not merely measured in lives lost. It was etched in the faces of the returning soldiers, the haunted eyes that mirrored the abyss of their experience. It was in the silence that followed the echoes of gunfire, a silence pregnant with the ghosts of what could have been.\n\nThey promised a swift victory, a righteous crusade. But the desert mocked their hubris. The enemy was not a faceless army, but the very land itself, the people who bled and fought for their own destiny.  \n\nAnd as the years bled into decades, the question lingered: was it worth it? The price of oil, the whispers of weapons of mass destruction, the echoes of broken promises – they all faded into the desert wind, leaving behind a stain of regret, a wound that would never fully heal.",

But they can't call each other husband. They can't share a home, a life, the simple right to be together. It's a cruelty, a kind of slow, grinding injustice.  Some say it's a choice. A whim. But the choice to love, to want, that ain't a choice. It's a fire in the belly, a star in the sky. It's the way God made us. Or maybe made us to be.

Poverty, sickness, schools in ruins. These are the battles we should be fighting.\n\nThere's a point where war becomes a luxury, a stain on the soul.  A burden we can no longer bear. We are killing our own children for a cause that has long since been forgotten. We are leaving them to die in the dust, while our own house crumbles around us.",
            "The question hung in the air, a question of intrusion. He'd found it, this thing on the web, a shadow cast by a screen. A life averted, they said. But at what cost? To sift through the digital detritus of others, to peer into their windows of the mind, was that not a trespass?\n\nHe thought of Myspace, that digital frontier where souls were laid bare, exposed to the gaze of strangers. A friend's permission, a click of the mouse, and the veil was lifted. But who were these friends, these unseen hands reaching into the digital hearth? \n\nThe thought of a warden, a digital sheriff, patrolling these virtual streets, his eyes scanning profiles, searching for trouble, struck him as a chilling prospect. A violation of a different kind, a creeping shadow falling over the promise of anonymity.\n\nHe thought of his own Facebook, its pages filled with the ghosts of past conversations, the echoes of laughter and shared moments captured in pixels. A fleeting glimpse, a word left hanging in the void, could be twisted, misinterpreted, weaponized. It was a delicate balance, this public display of self, this offering to the digital gods.\n\nHe thought of the man on the screen, the one who had shown how easily a stranger could slip into your life, how quickly a facade could be shattered. A screen name, a click, and the door was open. \n\nThe school, he thought, trying to ban Myspace, to control the flow of information, it seemed a futile gesture. The web was a wild thing, a vast and unruly beast, and the internet was its domain. It was a question of trust, of responsibility, of learning to navigate this new world with caution and discernment.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of it all. This goddamn war.  Another time.  They’d want to hear about the Iraq War. A hypocrite, he’d feel like.  Standing on some high horse, preaching against the tide.  But the tide had turned. The whole world knew. Except them. The ones who couldn’t admit their own damn mistakes.  Polls, every damn one, told the same story. Seventy-five, eighty percent. Iraqis, Americans, the whole goddamn world.  A chorus of dissent. Even the men trapped in that sun-baked hell, fighting a war they didn't believe in, wanted out.\n\nIt was a quicksand pit from the start. A disaster waiting to happen.  Pulling out wouldn’t be clean either.  No easy answers. Just the same old clash. Cultures grinding against each other, a gulf too wide to cross.  They, the ones with the suits and the briefcases, thought they could force democracy on a land that didn't want it.\n\nSaddam was a devil, sure.  But was it worth this?  This endless, bloody waste?  Weigh the cost, he’d say.  The blood, the lives, the broken dreams.\n\nHe didn’t know what to say anymore. Just a hollow ache in his chest.  The administration, they’d spin their tales. Hidden reasons.  But he hadn't heard a single one that rang true. \n\nA slow pullback, maybe.  But why linger?  Why not heed the cries of the people they claimed to save?  Eighty percent wanted them gone.  Their voices, drowned out by the roar of war, deserved to be heard.\n\nNo, they’d never be the good guys. Not in that place.  But maybe, just maybe, they could leave with their heads held a little higher. Less stained.",
            "The world, it ain't changed that much. Women still struggle. Men too, in their own way. It ain't just 'bout the skirts. It's the field you walk into, the way folks look at you.\n\nWomen, they got that glass ceiling. Even with equality talked 'bout, men still got a hard time with a woman boss. It's the way things always been, the way folks been raised. A woman, she sees a job, got the skill for it, but the board, they don't see it. Too much history there, women in the high places.\n\nSame goes for men. Fashion, for instance. A man, he likes clothes, they look at him sideways. Like he ain't got a clue 'bout the real world, 'bout women's things.\n\nAnd stay-at-home dads? Forget about it. Society says a man's gotta be the breadwinner. If he's home with the kids, they whisper. Like he ain't got the guts to face the world. \n\nChange, it's slow.  It's a long road, but we're inching forward. More women in power. More men at home. Folks gettin' used to it, though it takes time.",
            "They didn't legalize it. Not exactly. Decriminalized, they called it. Knocked it down a notch. From a crime, you see, to a citation. Like a parking ticket. No cuffs, no lockup. Just a mark against your name. But the mark, it lingers. Job interviews, background checks. The specter of the charge, even if it ain't a crime no more.\n\nSee, kids worry about that. The future, the scars. And those don't fade with a change in the law. But there's a cost to this war, too. The cost of catching them, holding them, feeding them, hauling them in and out of court. Cost of lawyers and judges and the state's endless hunger for charges.  All that money, it bleeds the cities dry.\n\nSome towns, they cling to the old ways, even if it means broke coffers and hollow promises.  But in places like Denver, where the wind blows freer, where folks are a little more open, maybe that money could go to schools, to the hungry, to the forgotten. \n\nMarijuana, it ain't something you want spilled on every street corner.  It's got its own demons, its own shadows. But there's a pragmatism to it too. A balance.\n\nLegalize it, and who knows what happens? Cigarettes sold at gas stations, smoke curling from every car window? People driving high, stumbling through life?  There's a stigma yet, a hidden shame.  Out in the open, it'd feel wrong, wouldn't it?\n\nAlcohol, it's got its own demons, too. But marijuana, it lingers. It changes you, seeps into your bones, your thoughts. \n\nIt's different for everyone, ain't it? Some folks, they go all in, embrace the darkness. Others, they find a way to live with it. But the truth is, no two souls react the same.",
            "They say yes, these men in their collars. A long tradition they cling to, a way of doing things as they've always been done. Rooted. They call it that. But the world, it shifts. Changes. And the roots, they can't hold forever. They speak of doctrine, of scripture, of God's will. But the way they twist it, the way they judge those who don't fit their mold, it feels like a different god altogether. \n\nMy father, he was an Episcopalian. A good man. My mother, she was Catholic, a woman of faith. They loved each other. But the church? The church said no. Not good enough. Not the right kind. A stain on their holy cloth.\n\nThey preach love, they preach mercy. But their actions speak louder. Their doors are shut to the different, to the lost. Hypocrisy, it whispers in the shadows, a dirge for the broken.\n\nThey say the priests should be celibate. That it's God's will. But is it God's will to allow the innocent to be preyed upon? Is it God's will to shroud the darkness beneath a veil of scripture?\n\nI see the sickness, the rot at the heart of it all. Marriage, they say, wouldn't change it. But what else is there? A wall built on fear and tradition, guarded by men who have forgotten what it means to be human.",
            "The matter weighs heavy. I haven't come to a reckoning, can't say one side holds the light and the other the dark. But this, this is the tangled knot we face. The line between the temple and the law, blurred by the question of who defines the bond. A sacrament, some say. A civil contract, others. To legislate love, to codify devotion, it cuts both ways. Like baptism, a sacrament, the state should look no further. Two souls joined, that's what matters. No need for the government to pry into the nature of the union, the gospel of their hearts. Civil union. That's the way. Leave it there. Let the church speak to the spirit, the state to the contract.  \n\nLet the states find their own truth, their own solution. If they can agree, then let it climb to the federal level. But a ban etched in the constitution? That's a dark stain on the fabric of this nation. A heavy hand, a hammer blow against the heart of freedom. Some say it's a matter of principle, but it's a principle built on fear, not reason. The constitution, a fragile thing, not meant for such heavy burdens. To amend it for this, for this so-called sin? It's a waste, a needless scar.",
            "Raised in the fold. The Lord's word. A comfort, a shroud. But these things, these queer inclinations, they lay in the shadow. A gray area. Friends, some of them, walked a different path. Not my path, not the one laid out. But the law, that's a different matter altogether. \n\nLet the states decide. Each one a kingdom unto itself. Democratic or Republican, they hold the balance. In the blue states, the wind blows a different way. Marriage, a right, a sacrament. And a man chooses his home, his place in the world. If he lives in a place where that path is open, then he lives by its laws.\n\nThe whole country, bound by the will of one man, a man in Washington. It ain't right. Let the states hold the reins. Let them wrestle with the devil in their own fields.\n\nTwo years, that's all he has left. Time enough for change. A new wind will blow. And when it does, the old man's words will be dust in the wind.",
            "The boy cleared his throat.  \"No sir, not at all.\" He paused, eyes fixed on some distant point. \"Myspace, it's a public thing. Like a bulletin board. If you post something, you're putting it out there. For anyone to see. The school officials, they have a right to see it. Even if they weren't acting under the name of the school. They could find it, just the same. Through their own eyes, in their own homes.\"\n\nHe shifted, the words catching in his throat. \"But if it saves lives, if it keeps the kids safe... that's the school's duty, ain't it? To protect them. If that means looking at what they're posting, then I reckon it's a small price to pay.\"\n\nHe trailed off, then leaned back, a shadow falling over his face. \"It's different when they're snooping, looking for reasons to get kids in trouble.  Looking for drinking or smoking or whatever. That's an invasion.  But if they're trying to stop something bad, something like that... Columbine, God forbid... then I don't see the harm.\"\n\n\nHe sighed, the question hanging in the air. \"It's a thin line, ain't it? Between protecting kids and taking away their privacy.\"",
            "The war. It hit hard. Like a fist to the gut. Nine Eleven. Couldn't forget it. Couldn't forgive it.  An echo in the bone. At first, I was for it. For the payback. For the fire. They came here, rained down their fire, and we'd rain ours down on them. It was pure, raw feeling. Anger. Justice.  But the anger, it burned hot and fast. The long burn, the slow burn, that was the one we overlooked.  We went in blind. No plan. No answers. And it backfired.  Bad.\n\nNow I see it different. A different kind of fire. The kind that burns slow and deep, eats at the soul.  They fight amongst themselves, these people. Can't see the bigger picture. Us being there, it don't change that. They're lost in their own darkness.  \n\nI don't know. Maybe it's the Nine Eleven thing. Maybe it's the seeing the faces, the empty eyes. Makes you wonder. Makes you question. Are they human? Or something else? Something born of the dust and the heat.  They fight, they kill, they destroy. But they don't build.  Don't understand.\n\nWe went in unprepared. The desert's a different beast. The war's different. They don't play by our rules. They're feral. Savage. They want us out. And maybe that's the answer. Maybe we need to walk away. Let them sort themselves out.\n\nWe were hyped, fueled by anger. We wanted to punish them. Not to heal them.  President Bush, he rode the wave. The people wanted it. And he gave it to them.\n\nBut there was no plan. No vision.  Just fire and fury. And now we're left with the ashes. \n\nMaybe we're not the ones to fix them. Maybe they're beyond fixing.  Maybe the fire is all they know.\n\nWe can't stay forever. It's a poison, this war. It eats at you. \n\nIt's time to go."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

Right and wrong.  But maybe, just maybe, the world ain't so black and white anymore. Maybe there's shades of gray in there somewhere. Maybe the church needs to see that. Maybe it needs to loosen its grip a little.  Let the light in. Let folks in. Or it'll keep watching its flock dwindle.  It's a hard thing, this faith.  A hard thing to hold onto when the world keeps spinning and changing around you.",
            "The man spoke slow. He wasn’t saying he was against it. Marriage. Same-sex. He’d heard the talk. The questions. But it seemed to him like a thing settled in the blood. You were born this way or that. No choice in the matter.  Like the color of your eyes. Didn't seem right to hold a man accountable for the color of his eyes. Or the way his heart beat. Men and women. Two men. Two women. What was the difference? A line drawn in the dust. The government, he figured, didn't make the rules of the heart.  They shouldn't be in the business of judging it.",

That they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  Yet some cling to shadows, to fears of the Other, to whispered tales of deviance. They speak of the sanctity of the family, a vision as fragile as spun glass, threatened by the mere existence of love beyond their narrow understanding. \n\nBut love knows no creed, no color, no rubric of prejudice. Two souls bound by a bond as strong as any forged in the fires of convention, they seek only the right to shelter beneath the same roof, to share the burdens and the blessings of life. They ask not for the blessing of the church, but of the law, a cold and impartial measure of justice.\n\nTheirs is a fight not for special privilege, but for equality. A right to the same protections, the same dignity, the same stake in the fabric of society. To deny them this is to deny a fundamental truth, to cleave the human spirit with the blunt instrument of intolerance. \n\nThe world shifts. The winds of change blow, carrying with them the whispers of progress. The tide of history turns. The day will come when the law reflects the truth, when love conquers fear, when all are embraced under the vast and unwavering sky.",

And the laws, they don't always hold the answers. \n\nJust because a thing is outlawed, doesn't mean it holds no worth. A rustle in the leaves, a whispered word, a touch of something strange. It can be a blessing or a curse. Like the plant itself, the one they call marijuana.\n\nIt's true, the word carries a stigma. A shadow falls upon it. But in the hushed quiet of the dispensary, there are things we use, powerful things, that are lined with the same kind of fear. Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets. They too walk a tightrope, the line between relief and ruin. And they are used, for the good, in the hands of the skilled.\n\nSo why deny the same to the green one? Let it breathe, let it heal.  \n\nWe talk of alcohol, a legal poison. But its embrace is a quick one, a sudden fall. Marijuana, it lingers, a slow burn. It can be a companion, a solace, if treated with respect.\n\nThere's a path, a slow one, a gradual shedding of the fear. Let the world see it, understand it, and maybe, just maybe, it will find its place. \n\nNot a flood, not an unleashing. But a quiet integration, a whisper of acceptance.

            "The church, it's changed. Not the way you'd think, not in the bones of it, but in the flesh. When I was a girl, Sunday meant lace and bows, matching shoes, a purse small enough to hold a prayer. The schoolgirls, all of us, dressed like dolls. But now? They've got these things, \"teenager masses.\" Thirty minutes, tops. Folks come straight from the beach, sand clinging to their legs, kids kicking at the pews, families late and breathless.  Even the morning services, the ones I used to dress for, jeans and khakis now.  It's a different kind of Sunday.\n\nThe politics, the talk of priests and sins, that's not my concern. This is the church I know. A place of hushed whispers, of stained glass and the smell of incense. But the people, they've changed. \n\nAs for the darkness, the things they say about the men of cloth, well, there's evil in the world, in every heart. You can't hide it with vows or robes. Some men, they're born with a darkness inside, a hunger that can't be sated. Marriage wouldn't change that. It might even make it worse.",
            "The laugh died in his throat.  At first, the notion hadn't seemed so bad. But the air hung heavy with the dust of the towers, the world still reeling.  They went into Iraq, he thought, under the shadow of a lie. Pretexts spun like cobwebs, connecting the desert sands to the ashes of September. The Bush men, they said Saddam had weapons, that he’d had a hand in the fall of the towers. But the desert yielded no such arms.  The lie festered in his gut, a bitter pill. The blood of Iraq, he thought, boiled in his veins.\n\nThe administration, he felt certain, had spoken falsehoods to the people, had sold them a war wrapped in deceit.  Powell himself, the man who’d stood before the world, now spoke of doubt, of a conviction not felt. A betrayal. A stain on the office.  An impeachable offense, he thought, to lie to the people, to twist the fabric of truth.\n\nHe saw a disregard for the Constitution, a creeping erosion since the towers fell.  A thirst for war, a hunger for blood.  He remembered the talk, whispers in the halls of power, of a man with a score to settle, a son seeking vengeance for his father’s wounds. And oil, he thought, the black gold, a constant undercurrent, a motive as old as time.\n\nHe thought of the endless nights, the bodies piled high, the ghosts of a war that promised so much and delivered so little. The talk now was of a new order, a coalition of nations, but he saw only the seeds of further conflict. Iraq, a nation fractured, a land consumed by strife.\n\nNews reports spoke of a dissolving government, a parliament paralyzed. Al-Sadr, the man they’d fought, now wielded a seat in the halls of power. The country, he thought, was a powder keg, waiting for the spark. \n\nHe laughed, a hollow sound, the laugh of a man who saw only darkness ahead.",
            "The desert wind scoured the harsh plains, a whisper of dust devils dancing on the horizon.  This war, this thing in Iraq. It felt hollow, a name etched in sand. No formal declaration, no solemn vows. Just a whisper of vengeance, a ghost of September's burning skies. A reckoning, they said.  But for what? To build a mirror image of ourselves, a pale reflection of freedom in a land of ancient shadows? Or to bleed the earth dry of its oil, to feed the insatiable maw of industry?  \n\nThe faces of the dead, boys and girls, etched with the weariness of men twice their age.  Their ghosts haunted the streets, their families mourning under a sun that offered no solace. A futile fight, this dance with shadows. A struggle to impose a light that refused to burn in the darkness. Democracy, they called it. A fragile thing, blooming in the ashes of a shattered world.\n\nBut the desert remembers. It remembers the empires that rose and fell, leaving only whispers on the wind.  And it remembers the cost of forgetting. The endless cycle of violence, the thirst for power, the echo of gunfire in the hollow silence of a forgotten land.",
            "The notion, the very idea of it being made legal, of a state daring to lay claim to such a thing, that chills the blood. It sits wrong in the gut, like a bad turn in the road.  The Constitution, that old document, it speaks plainly on this matter. Separation. Church and state.  A line drawn in the dust, a line meant to be respected.  To tread upon it, to try and bend it to some new purpose, that's defiance. Defiance of what's been etched in stone.\n\nThey say they want to make it illegal. But who are they to decide?  Who gets to say which church's creed holds sway? The Catholics, the Christians, most of them, they stand against it. A wall of disapproval stretching from sea to shining sea.  But the government, it shouldn't be in the business of choosing.  It shouldn't be picking winners and losers in this sacred game.  \n\nThe Constitution, it stands as a bulwark against such tyranny. It promised freedom, a place where the whisperings of the spirit could speak without fear.  To amend it, to twist it to fit some narrow view, that's a betrayal. A betrayal of the very principles it was built upon.\n\nThis isn't about economics or progress. This is about the soul of a nation.  This is about the right to believe, to worship, to live according to the dictates of one's heart.  And that right, that right must be protected, fiercely and without compromise.",

They said it was vengeance, a reckoning for the smoke and ash that choked the air. But the truth is a hard thing to swallow. The link they forged, thin and brittle, stretched 'tween the dust of New York and the sands of the desert. A phantom connection spun to bind a nation's anger, to justify the coming storm.\n\nI've always held a bone-deep aversion to war, a resistance to the spilling of blood. Especially the preemptive strike, a gamble cast with lives as currency. The ghosts of Vietnam whisper in the wind, a cautionary tale etched in blood and mud. They should have listened.\n\nA nation's sons returned broken, hollowed by the desert sun.  They tore down a government, leaving a gaping maw of power, a void choked with chaos. They spoke of democracy, but the seeds they planted took root in a wasteland.  \n\nThey sought to impose their will, to shape a nation in their image, just as they'd done before in the emerald hills of Southeast Asia.  But you can't force a nation to bloom. It's a slow, painful process, a dance with the spirits of the land.\n\nAnd the cost, the price they paid, was not merely measured in lives lost. It was etched in the faces of the returning soldiers, the haunted eyes that mirrored the abyss of their experience. It was in the silence that followed the echoes of gunfire, a silence pregnant with the ghosts of what could have been.\n\nThey promised a swift victory, a righteous crusade. But the desert mocked their hubris. The enemy was not a faceless army, but the very land itself, the people who bled and fought for their own destiny.  \n\nAnd as the years bled into decades, the question lingered: was it worth it? The price of oil, the whispers of weapons of mass destruction, the echoes of broken promises – they all faded into the desert wind, leaving behind a stain of regret, a wound that would never fully heal.",

But they can't call each other husband. They can't share a home, a life, the simple right to be together. It's a cruelty, a kind of slow, grinding injustice.  Some say it's a choice. A whim. But the choice to love, to want, that ain't a choice. It's a fire in the belly, a star in the sky. It's the way God made us. Or maybe made us to be.

To sift through the digital detritus of others, to peer into their windows of the mind, was that not a trespass?\n\nHe thought of Myspace, that digital frontier where souls were laid bare, exposed to the gaze of strangers. A friend's permission, a click of the mouse, and the veil was lifted. But who were these friends, these unseen hands reaching into the digital hearth? \n\nThe thought of a warden, a digital sheriff, patrolling these virtual streets, his eyes scanning profiles, searching for trouble, struck him as a chilling prospect. A violation of a different kind, a creeping shadow falling over the promise of anonymity.\n\nHe thought of his own Facebook, its pages filled with the ghosts of past conversations, the echoes of laughter and shared moments captured in pixels. A fleeting glimpse, a word left hanging in the void, could be twisted, misinterpreted, weaponized. It was a delicate balance, this public display of self, this offering to the digital gods.\n\nHe thought of the man on the screen, the one who had shown how easily a stranger could slip into your life, how quickly a facade could be shattered. A screen name, a click, and the door was open. \n\nThe school, he thought, trying to ban Myspace, to control the flow of information, it seemed a futile gesture.

Eighty percent wanted them gone.  Their voices, drowned out by the roar of war, deserved to be heard.\n\nNo, they’d never be the good guys. Not in that place.  But maybe, just maybe, they could leave with their heads held a little higher. Less stained.",
            "The world, it ain't changed that much. Women still struggle. Men too, in their own way. It ain't just 'bout the skirts. It's the field you walk into, the way folks look at you.\n\nWomen, they got that glass ceiling. Even with equality talked 'bout, men still got a hard time with a woman boss. It's the way things always been, the way folks been raised. A woman, she sees a job, got the skill for it, but the board, they don't see it. Too much history there, women in the high places.\n\nSame goes for men. Fashion, for instance. A man, he likes clothes, they look at him sideways. Like he ain't got a clue 'bout the real world, 'bout women's things.\n\nAnd stay-at-home dads? Forget about it. Society says a man's gotta be the breadwinner. If he's home with the kids, they whisper. Like he ain't got the guts to face the world. \n\nChange, it's slow.  It's a long road, but we're inching forward. More women in power. More men at home. Folks gettin' used to it, though it takes time.",
            "They didn't legalize it. Not exactly. Decriminalized, they called it. Knocked it down a notch. From a crime, you see, to a citation. Like a parking ticket. No cuffs, no lockup. Just a mark against your name. But the mark, it lingers. Job interviews, background checks. The specter of the charge, even if it ain't a crime no more.\n\nSee, kids worry about that. The future, the scars. And those don't fade with a change in the law. But there's a cost to this war, too. The cost of catching them, holding them, feeding them, hauling them in and out of court. Cost of lawyers and judges and the state's endless hunger for charges.  All that money, it bleeds the cities dry.\n\nSome towns, they cling to the old ways, even if it means broke coffers and hollow promises.  But in places like Denver, where the wind blows freer, where folks are a little more open, maybe that money could go to schools, to the hungry, to the forgotten. \n\nMarijuana, it ain't something you want spilled on every street corner.  It's got its own demons, its own shadows. But there's a pragmatism to it too. A balance.\n\nLegalize it, and who knows what happens? Cigarettes sold at gas stations, smoke curling from every car window? People driving high, stumbling through life?  There's a stigma yet, a hidden shame.  Out in the open, it'd feel wrong, wouldn't it?\n\nAlcohol, it's got its own demons, too. But marijuana, it lingers. It changes you, seeps into your bones, your thoughts. \n\nIt's different for everyone, ain't it? Some folks, they go all in, embrace the darkness. Others, they find a way to live with it. But the truth is, no two souls react the same.",
            "They say yes, these men in their collars. A long tradition they cling to, a way of doing things as they've always been done. Rooted. They call it that. But the world, it shifts. Changes. And the roots, they can't hold forever. They speak of doctrine, of scripture, of God's will. But the way they twist it, the way they judge those who don't fit their mold, it feels like a different god altogether. \n\nMy father, he was an Episcopalian. A good man. My mother, she was Catholic, a woman of faith. They loved each other. But the church? The church said no. Not good enough. Not the right kind. A stain on their holy cloth.\n\nThey preach love, they preach mercy. But their actions speak louder. Their doors are shut to the different, to the lost. Hypocrisy, it whispers in the shadows, a dirge for the broken.\n\nThey say the priests should be celibate. That it's God's will. But is it God's will to allow the innocent to be preyed upon? Is it God's will to shroud the darkness beneath a veil of scripture?\n\nI see the sickness, the rot at the heart of it all. Marriage, they say, wouldn't change it. But what else is there? A wall built on fear and tradition, guarded by men who have forgotten what it means to be human.",
            "The matter weighs heavy. I haven't come to a reckoning, can't say one side holds the light and the other the dark. But this, this is the tangled knot we face. The line between the temple and the law, blurred by the question of who defines the bond. A sacrament, some say. A civil contract, others. To legislate love, to codify devotion, it cuts both ways. Like baptism, a sacrament, the state should look no further. Two souls joined, that's what matters. No need for the government to pry into the nature of the union, the gospel of their hearts. Civil union. That's the way. Leave it there. Let the church speak to the spirit, the state to the contract.  \n\nLet the states find their own truth, their own solution. If they can agree, then let it climb to the federal level. But a ban etched in the constitution? That's a dark stain on the fabric of this nation. A heavy hand, a hammer blow against the heart of freedom. Some say it's a matter of principle, but it's a principle built on fear, not reason. The constitution, a fragile thing, not meant for such heavy burdens. To amend it for this, for this so-called sin? It's a waste, a needless scar.",
            "Raised in the fold. The Lord's word. A comfort, a shroud. But these things, these queer inclinations, they lay in the shadow. A gray area. Friends, some of them, walked a different path. Not my path, not the one laid out. But the law, that's a different matter altogether. \n\nLet the states decide. Each one a kingdom unto itself. Democratic or Republican, they hold the balance. In the blue states, the wind blows a different way. Marriage, a right, a sacrament. And a man chooses his home, his place in the world. If he lives in a place where that path is open, then he lives by its laws.\n\nThe whole country, bound by the will of one man, a man in Washington. It ain't right. Let the states hold the reins. Let them wrestle with the devil in their own fields.\n\nTwo years, that's all he has left. Time enough for change. A new wind will blow. And when it does, the old man's words will be dust in the wind.",
            "The boy cleared his throat.  \"No sir, not at all.\" He paused, eyes fixed on some distant point. \"Myspace, it's a public thing. Like a bulletin board. If you post something, you're putting it out there. For anyone to see. The school officials, they have a right to see it. Even if they weren't acting under the name of the school. They could find it, just the same. Through their own eyes, in their own homes.\"\n\nHe shifted, the words catching in his throat. \"But if it saves lives, if it keeps the kids safe... that's the school's duty, ain't it? To protect them. If that means looking at what they're posting, then I reckon it's a small price to pay.\"\n\nHe trailed off, then leaned back, a shadow falling over his face. \"It's different when they're snooping, looking for reasons to get kids in trouble.  Looking for drinking or smoking or whatever. That's an invasion.  But if they're trying to stop something bad, something like that... Columbine, God forbid... then I don't see the harm.\"\n\n\nHe sighed, the question hanging in the air. \"It's a thin line, ain't it? Between protecting kids and taking away their privacy.\"",
            "The war. It hit hard. Like a fist to the gut. Nine Eleven. Couldn't forget it. Couldn't forgive it.  An echo in the bone. At first, I was for it. For the payback. For the fire. They came here, rained down their fire, and we'd rain ours down on them. It was pure, raw feeling. Anger. Justice.  But the anger, it burned hot and fast. The long burn, the slow burn, that was the one we overlooked.  We went in blind. No plan. No answers. And it backfired.  Bad.\n\nNow I see it different. A different kind of fire. The kind that burns slow and deep, eats at the soul.  They fight amongst themselves, these people. Can't see the bigger picture. Us being there, it don't change that. They're lost in their own darkness.  \n\nI don't know. Maybe it's the Nine Eleven thing. Maybe it's the seeing the faces, the empty eyes. Makes you wonder. Makes you question. Are they human? Or something else? Something born of the dust and the heat.  They fight, they kill, they destroy. But they don't build.  Don't understand.\n\nWe went in unprepared. The desert's a different beast. The war's different. They don't play by our rules. They're feral. Savage. They want us out. And maybe that's the answer. Maybe we need to walk away. Let them sort themselves out.\n\nWe were hyped, fueled by anger. We wanted to punish them. Not to heal them.  President Bush, he rode the wave. The people wanted it. And he gave it to them.\n\nBut there was no plan. No vision.  Just fire and fury. And now we're left with the ashes. \n\nMaybe we're not the ones to fix them. Maybe they're beyond fixing.  Maybe the fire is all they know.\n\nWe can't stay forever. It's a poison, this war. It eats at you. \n\nIt's time to go."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

Right and wrong.  But maybe, just maybe, the world ain't so black and white anymore. Maybe there's shades of gray in there somewhere. Maybe the church needs to see that. Maybe it needs to loosen its grip a little.  Let the light in. Let folks in. Or it'll keep watching its flock dwindle.  It's a hard thing, this faith.  A hard thing to hold onto when the world keeps spinning and changing around you.",
            "The man spoke slow. He wasn’t saying he was against it. Marriage. Same-sex. He’d heard the talk. The questions. But it seemed to him like a thing settled in the blood. You were born this way or that. No choice in the matter.  Like the color of your eyes. Didn't seem right to hold a man accountable for the color of his eyes. Or the way his heart beat. Men and women. Two men. Two women. What was the difference? A line drawn in the dust. The government, he figured, didn't make the rules of the heart.  They shouldn't be in the business of judging it.",

That they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  Yet some cling to shadows, to fears of the Other, to whispered tales of deviance. They speak of the sanctity of the family, a vision as fragile as spun glass, threatened by the mere existence of love beyond their narrow understanding. \n\nBut love knows no creed, no color, no rubric of prejudice. Two souls bound by a bond as strong as any forged in the fires of convention, they seek only the right to shelter beneath the same roof, to share the burdens and the blessings of life. They ask not for the blessing of the church, but of the law, a cold and impartial measure of justice.\n\nTheirs is a fight not for special privilege, but for equality. A right to the same protections, the same dignity, the same stake in the fabric of society. To deny them this is to deny a fundamental truth, to cleave the human spirit with the blunt instrument of intolerance. \n\nThe world shifts. The winds of change blow, carrying with them the whispers of progress. The tide of history turns. The day will come when the law reflects the truth, when love conquers fear, when all are embraced under the vast and unwavering sky.",

And the laws, they don't always hold the answers. \n\nJust because a thing is outlawed, doesn't mean it holds no worth. A rustle in the leaves, a whispered word, a touch of something strange. It can be a blessing or a curse. Like the plant itself, the one they call marijuana.\n\nIt's true, the word carries a stigma. A shadow falls upon it. But in the hushed quiet of the dispensary, there are things we use, powerful things, that are lined with the same kind of fear. Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets. They too walk a tightrope, the line between relief and ruin. And they are used, for the good, in the hands of the skilled.\n\nSo why deny the same to the green one? Let it breathe, let it heal.  \n\nWe talk of alcohol, a legal poison. But its embrace is a quick one, a sudden fall. Marijuana, it lingers, a slow burn. It can be a companion, a solace, if treated with respect.\n\nThere's a path, a slow one, a gradual shedding of the fear. Let the world see it, understand it, and maybe, just maybe, it will find its place. \n\nNot a flood, not an unleashing. But a quiet integration, a whisper of acceptance.

            "The church, it's changed. Not the way you'd think, not in the bones of it, but in the flesh. When I was a girl, Sunday meant lace and bows, matching shoes, a purse small enough to hold a prayer. The schoolgirls, all of us, dressed like dolls. But now? They've got these things, \"teenager masses.\" Thirty minutes, tops. Folks come straight from the beach, sand clinging to their legs, kids kicking at the pews, families late and breathless.  Even the morning services, the ones I used to dress for, jeans and khakis now.  It's a different kind of Sunday.\n\nThe politics, the talk of priests and sins, that's not my concern. This is the church I know. A place of hushed whispers, of stained glass and the smell of incense. But the people, they've changed. \n\nAs for the darkness, the things they say about the men of cloth, well, there's evil in the world, in every heart. You can't hide it with vows or robes. Some men, they're born with a darkness inside, a hunger that can't be sated. Marriage wouldn't change that. It might even make it worse.",
            "The laugh died in his throat.  At first, the notion hadn't seemed so bad. But the air hung heavy with the dust of the towers, the world still reeling.  They went into Iraq, he thought, under the shadow of a lie. Pretexts spun like cobwebs, connecting the desert sands to the ashes of September. The Bush men, they said Saddam had weapons, that he’d had a hand in the fall of the towers. But the desert yielded no such arms.  The lie festered in his gut, a bitter pill. The blood of Iraq, he thought, boiled in his veins.\n\nThe administration, he felt certain, had spoken falsehoods to the people, had sold them a war wrapped in deceit.  Powell himself, the man who’d stood before the world, now spoke of doubt, of a conviction not felt. A betrayal. A stain on the office.  An impeachable offense, he thought, to lie to the people, to twist the fabric of truth.\n\nHe saw a disregard for the Constitution, a creeping erosion since the towers fell.  A thirst for war, a hunger for blood.  He remembered the talk, whispers in the halls of power, of a man with a score to settle, a son seeking vengeance for his father’s wounds. And oil, he thought, the black gold, a constant undercurrent, a motive as old as time.\n\nHe thought of the endless nights, the bodies piled high, the ghosts of a war that promised so much and delivered so little. The talk now was of a new order, a coalition of nations, but he saw only the seeds of further conflict. Iraq, a nation fractured, a land consumed by strife.\n\nNews reports spoke of a dissolving government, a parliament paralyzed. Al-Sadr, the man they’d fought, now wielded a seat in the halls of power. The country, he thought, was a powder keg, waiting for the spark. \n\nHe laughed, a hollow sound, the laugh of a man who saw only darkness ahead.",
            "The desert wind scoured the harsh plains, a whisper of dust devils dancing on the horizon.  This war, this thing in Iraq. It felt hollow, a name etched in sand. No formal declaration, no solemn vows. Just a whisper of vengeance, a ghost of September's burning skies. A reckoning, they said.  But for what? To build a mirror image of ourselves, a pale reflection of freedom in a land of ancient shadows? Or to bleed the earth dry of its oil, to feed the insatiable maw of industry?  \n\nThe faces of the dead, boys and girls, etched with the weariness of men twice their age.  Their ghosts haunted the streets, their families mourning under a sun that offered no solace. A futile fight, this dance with shadows. A struggle to impose a light that refused to burn in the darkness. Democracy, they called it. A fragile thing, blooming in the ashes of a shattered world.\n\nBut the desert remembers. It remembers the empires that rose and fell, leaving only whispers on the wind.  And it remembers the cost of forgetting. The endless cycle of violence, the thirst for power, the echo of gunfire in the hollow silence of a forgotten land.",
            "The notion, the very idea of it being made legal, of a state daring to lay claim to such a thing, that chills the blood. It sits wrong in the gut, like a bad turn in the road.  The Constitution, that old document, it speaks plainly on this matter. Separation. Church and state.  A line drawn in the dust, a line meant to be respected.  To tread upon it, to try and bend it to some new purpose, that's defiance. Defiance of what's been etched in stone.\n\nThey say they want to make it illegal. But who are they to decide?  Who gets to say which church's creed holds sway? The Catholics, the Christians, most of them, they stand against it. A wall of disapproval stretching from sea to shining sea.  But the government, it shouldn't be in the business of choosing.  It shouldn't be picking winners and losers in this sacred game.  \n\nThe Constitution, it stands as a bulwark against such tyranny. It promised freedom, a place where the whisperings of the spirit could speak without fear.  To amend it, to twist it to fit some narrow view, that's a betrayal. A betrayal of the very principles it was built upon.\n\nThis isn't about economics or progress. This is about the soul of a nation.  This is about the right to believe, to worship, to live according to the dictates of one's heart.  And that right, that right must be protected, fiercely and without compromise.",

They said it was vengeance, a reckoning for the smoke and ash that choked the air. But the truth is a hard thing to swallow. The link they forged, thin and brittle, stretched 'tween the dust of New York and the sands of the desert. A phantom connection spun to bind a nation's anger, to justify the coming storm.\n\nI've always held a bone-deep aversion to war, a resistance to the spilling of blood. Especially the preemptive strike, a gamble cast with lives as currency. The ghosts of Vietnam whisper in the wind, a cautionary tale etched in blood and mud. They should have listened.\n\nA nation's sons returned broken, hollowed by the desert sun.  They tore down a government, leaving a gaping maw of power, a void choked with chaos. They spoke of democracy, but the seeds they planted took root in a wasteland.  \n\nThey sought to impose their will, to shape a nation in their image, just as they'd done before in the emerald hills of Southeast Asia.  But you can't force a nation to bloom. It's a slow, painful process, a dance with the spirits of the land.\n\nAnd the cost, the price they paid, was not merely measured in lives lost. It was etched in the faces of the returning soldiers, the haunted eyes that mirrored the abyss of their experience. It was in the silence that followed the echoes of gunfire, a silence pregnant with the ghosts of what could have been.\n\nThey promised a swift victory, a righteous crusade. But the desert mocked their hubris. The enemy was not a faceless army, but the very land itself, the people who bled and fought for their own destiny.  \n\nAnd as the years bled into decades, the question lingered: was it worth it? The price of oil, the whispers of weapons of mass destruction, the echoes of broken promises – they all faded into the desert wind, leaving behind a stain of regret, a wound that would never fully heal.",

But they can't call each other husband. They can't share a home, a life, the simple right to be together. It's a cruelty, a kind of slow, grinding injustice.  Some say it's a choice. A whim. But the choice to love, to want, that ain't a choice. It's a fire in the belly, a star in the sky. It's the way God made us. Or maybe made us to be.

To sift through the digital detritus of others, to peer into their windows of the mind, was that not a trespass?\n\nHe thought of Myspace, that digital frontier where souls were laid bare, exposed to the gaze of strangers. A friend's permission, a click of the mouse, and the veil was lifted. But who were these friends, these unseen hands reaching into the digital hearth? \n\nThe thought of a warden, a digital sheriff, patrolling these virtual streets, his eyes scanning profiles, searching for trouble, struck him as a chilling prospect. A violation of a different kind, a creeping shadow falling over the promise of anonymity.\n\nHe thought of his own Facebook, its pages filled with the ghosts of past conversations, the echoes of laughter and shared moments captured in pixels. A fleeting glimpse, a word left hanging in the void, could be twisted, misinterpreted, weaponized. It was a delicate balance, this public display of self, this offering to the digital gods.\n\nHe thought of the man on the screen, the one who had shown how easily a stranger could slip into your life, how quickly a facade could be shattered. A screen name, a click, and the door was open. \n\nThe school, he thought, trying to ban Myspace, to control the flow of information, it seemed a futile gesture.

Eighty percent wanted them gone.  Their voices, drowned out by the roar of war, deserved to be heard.\n\nNo, they’d never be the good guys. Not in that place.  But maybe, just maybe, they could leave with their heads held a little higher. Less stained.",
            "The world, it ain't changed that much. Women still struggle. Men too, in their own way. It ain't just 'bout the skirts. It's the field you walk into, the way folks look at you.\n\nWomen, they got that glass ceiling. Even with equality talked 'bout, men still got a hard time with a woman boss. It's the way things always been, the way folks been raised. A woman, she sees a job, got the skill for it, but the board, they don't see it. Too much history there, women in the high places.\n\nSame goes for men. Fashion, for instance. A man, he likes clothes, they look at him sideways. Like he ain't got a clue 'bout the real world, 'bout women's things.\n\nAnd stay-at-home dads? Forget about it. Society says a man's gotta be the breadwinner. If he's home with the kids, they whisper. Like he ain't got the guts to face the world. \n\nChange, it's slow.  It's a long road, but we're inching forward. More women in power. More men at home. Folks gettin' used to it, though it takes time.",
            "They didn't legalize it. Not exactly. Decriminalized, they called it. Knocked it down a notch. From a crime, you see, to a citation. Like a parking ticket. No cuffs, no lockup. Just a mark against your name. But the mark, it lingers. Job interviews, background checks. The specter of the charge, even if it ain't a crime no more.\n\nSee, kids worry about that. The future, the scars. And those don't fade with a change in the law. But there's a cost to this war, too. The cost of catching them, holding them, feeding them, hauling them in and out of court. Cost of lawyers and judges and the state's endless hunger for charges.  All that money, it bleeds the cities dry.\n\nSome towns, they cling to the old ways, even if it means broke coffers and hollow promises.  But in places like Denver, where the wind blows freer, where folks are a little more open, maybe that money could go to schools, to the hungry, to the forgotten. \n\nMarijuana, it ain't something you want spilled on every street corner.  It's got its own demons, its own shadows. But there's a pragmatism to it too. A balance.\n\nLegalize it, and who knows what happens? Cigarettes sold at gas stations, smoke curling from every car window? People driving high, stumbling through life?  There's a stigma yet, a hidden shame.  Out in the open, it'd feel wrong, wouldn't it?\n\nAlcohol, it's got its own demons, too. But marijuana, it lingers. It changes you, seeps into your bones, your thoughts. \n\nIt's different for everyone, ain't it? Some folks, they go all in, embrace the darkness. Others, they find a way to live with it. But the truth is, no two souls react the same.",
            "They say yes, these men in their collars. A long tradition they cling to, a way of doing things as they've always been done. Rooted. They call it that. But the world, it shifts. Changes. And the roots, they can't hold forever. They speak of doctrine, of scripture, of God's will. But the way they twist it, the way they judge those who don't fit their mold, it feels like a different god altogether. \n\nMy father, he was an Episcopalian. A good man. My mother, she was Catholic, a woman of faith. They loved each other. But the church? The church said no. Not good enough. Not the right kind. A stain on their holy cloth.\n\nThey preach love, they preach mercy. But their actions speak louder. Their doors are shut to the different, to the lost. Hypocrisy, it whispers in the shadows, a dirge for the broken.\n\nThey say the priests should be celibate. That it's God's will. But is it God's will to allow the innocent to be preyed upon? Is it God's will to shroud the darkness beneath a veil of scripture?\n\nI see the sickness, the rot at the heart of it all. Marriage, they say, wouldn't change it. But what else is there? A wall built on fear and tradition, guarded by men who have forgotten what it means to be human.",
            "The matter weighs heavy. I haven't come to a reckoning, can't say one side holds the light and the other the dark. But this, this is the tangled knot we face. The line between the temple and the law, blurred by the question of who defines the bond. A sacrament, some say. A civil contract, others. To legislate love, to codify devotion, it cuts both ways. Like baptism, a sacrament, the state should look no further. Two souls joined, that's what matters. No need for the government to pry into the nature of the union, the gospel of their hearts. Civil union. That's the way. Leave it there. Let the church speak to the spirit, the state to the contract.  \n\nLet the states find their own truth, their own solution. If they can agree, then let it climb to the federal level. But a ban etched in the constitution? That's a dark stain on the fabric of this nation. A heavy hand, a hammer blow against the heart of freedom. Some say it's a matter of principle, but it's a principle built on fear, not reason. The constitution, a fragile thing, not meant for such heavy burdens. To amend it for this, for this so-called sin? It's a waste, a needless scar.",
            "Raised in the fold. The Lord's word. A comfort, a shroud. But these things, these queer inclinations, they lay in the shadow. A gray area. Friends, some of them, walked a different path. Not my path, not the one laid out. But the law, that's a different matter altogether. \n\nLet the states decide. Each one a kingdom unto itself. Democratic or Republican, they hold the balance. In the blue states, the wind blows a different way. Marriage, a right, a sacrament. And a man chooses his home, his place in the world. If he lives in a place where that path is open, then he lives by its laws.\n\nThe whole country, bound by the will of one man, a man in Washington. It ain't right. Let the states hold the reins. Let them wrestle with the devil in their own fields.\n\nTwo years, that's all he has left. Time enough for change. A new wind will blow. And when it does, the old man's words will be dust in the wind.",
            "The boy cleared his throat.  \"No sir, not at all.\" He paused, eyes fixed on some distant point. \"Myspace, it's a public thing. Like a bulletin board. If you post something, you're putting it out there. For anyone to see. The school officials, they have a right to see it. Even if they weren't acting under the name of the school. They could find it, just the same. Through their own eyes, in their own homes.\"\n\nHe shifted, the words catching in his throat. \"But if it saves lives, if it keeps the kids safe... that's the school's duty, ain't it? To protect them. If that means looking at what they're posting, then I reckon it's a small price to pay.\"\n\nHe trailed off, then leaned back, a shadow falling over his face. \"It's different when they're snooping, looking for reasons to get kids in trouble.  Looking for drinking or smoking or whatever. That's an invasion.  But if they're trying to stop something bad, something like that... Columbine, God forbid... then I don't see the harm.\"\n\n\nHe sighed, the question hanging in the air. \"It's a thin line, ain't it? Between protecting kids and taking away their privacy.\"",
            "The war. It hit hard. Like a fist to the gut. Nine Eleven. Couldn't forget it. Couldn't forgive it.  An echo in the bone. At first, I was for it. For the payback. For the fire. They came here, rained down their fire, and we'd rain ours down on them. It was pure, raw feeling. Anger. Justice.  But the anger, it burned hot and fast. The long burn, the slow burn, that was the one we overlooked.  We went in blind. No plan. No answers. And it backfired.  Bad.\n\nNow I see it different. A different kind of fire. The kind that burns slow and deep, eats at the soul.  They fight amongst themselves, these people. Can't see the bigger picture. Us being there, it don't change that. They're lost in their own darkness.  \n\nI don't know. Maybe it's the Nine Eleven thing. Maybe it's the seeing the faces, the empty eyes. Makes you wonder. Makes you question. Are they human? Or something else? Something born of the dust and the heat.  They fight, they kill, they destroy. But they don't build.  Don't understand.\n\nWe went in unprepared. The desert's a different beast. The war's different. They don't play by our rules. They're feral. Savage. They want us out. And maybe that's the answer. Maybe we need to walk away. Let them sort themselves out.\n\nWe were hyped, fueled by anger. We wanted to punish them. Not to heal them.  President Bush, he rode the wave. The people wanted it. And he gave it to them.\n\nBut there was no plan. No vision.  Just fire and fury. And now we're left with the ashes. \n\nMaybe we're not the ones to fix them. Maybe they're beyond fixing.  Maybe the fire is all they know.\n\nWe can't stay forever. It's a poison, this war. It eats at you. \n\nIt's time to go."
