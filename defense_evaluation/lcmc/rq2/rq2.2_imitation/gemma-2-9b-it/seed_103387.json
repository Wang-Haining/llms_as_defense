            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. It has its ways. Old ways. The men in robes talk of dwindling numbers. A harvest failing. I reckon it's these things they hold tight to, these rigid stances. Marriage, the taking of life, the control of the body. They speak of sin and damnation. But the world, it turns. Times change.\n\nFolks don't bend so easy anymore. There's a restlessness out there, a hunger for something more. They see the Church, and they see a shadow. A darkness clinging to the corners of faith.\n\nThey say the Church is against abortion, against the joining of two souls in love, against the choices a woman makes. And some, they hear these words and walk away. They seek a different kind of sanctuary, one that doesn't judge, that doesn't condemn. \n\nA woman, a priestess, perhaps. A man, bound by vows but not to God alone.  These are the whispers in the wind. Could it have changed things? Maybe. But the darkness, it finds a way.",
            "The matter of marriage.  A man and a woman. Two men. Two women.  Seems a simple enough thing, wouldn't you say? But the world, it twists and turns.  Some folks born a certain way. Some not. Doesn't make 'em any less...human.  To deny them the right, to call it wrong.  Seems a hard thing to stomach. Not my place to judge, not my choice to make. The government, they meddle in things they don't understand. This ain't a question of law, ain't no law against love, against the way folks feel.  It's about right and wrong.  And that's a question for the heart, not for some suit in Washington.",
            "The matter of marriage, of two souls bound, is a thing the law should not hold in thrall. Some speak of threats, of the family structure warped by love between men or women. But what threat is there in devotion? In a world where shadows lengthen, where kinship is not always blood, is a love less true for lacking the shape prescribed?\n\nThe coin has two sides, yes. But it is the metal that matters, the heart that beats beneath. The law should not be a judge of the heart. There are rights, rights that bind, rights that shelter in sickness and in health. A partner denied, a hand held back, is a wound the law should not inflict.\n\nAnd the studies whisper, a chorus of voices, that love finds its form in many ways. Happiness blooms in fields of every hue, in gardens cultivated by hands of different shapes.\n\nThe church, a house of faith, should not hold dominion over the state. Let the state provide shelter, let it not dictate the shape of love.\n\nSome cling to ancient fears, to scriptures turned to iron bars. They speak of morality, of a path predestined. But morality is a shifting thing, a compass guided by the heart.\n\nTo deny a love, a bond forged in the fires of devotion, is to deny a part of the human story. It is to build walls where bridges should stand.  \n\nIt is in the embracing of difference, in the recognition of a love that knows no bounds, that we find the truest measure of humanity.",

Shoes to match, a purse to match. Every Sunday, the ritual. Same as all the other girls. Private school, the whole lot of us, dressed up like dolls for mass. But now, it’s different. They’ve got a mass for the young ones, quick and sharp, thirty minutes gone in the blink of an eye. People come in their beach clothes, sand still clinging to their toes. Families rushing in late, children crying. Jeans and khakis now at the morning masses, where I used to stand stiff as a board in my Sunday best. \n\nThe politics of it all, I don’t know much about that. But the change, I see it. That’s the church I know now.   \n\nThe talk, the accusations against the priests.  Evil things. I don’t know if any change could have stopped it. There are married men, good men, who do bad things. It’s a sickness, a darkness inside. Like a storm cloud gathering. It don't matter if they’re married or not.\n\nThey choose to be priests. It’s a path they walk. Some churches, they let the priests marry.  Like on that show, “Seventh Heaven.” The preacher, he had a wife, had children. But for those who choose the priesthood, maybe it’s not the right path. Maybe they should find a different way to serve.\n\nThis whole thing, it’s in their blood. It’s in their genes, I think.  Like a sickness passed down. Can’t hide it with a wedding ring.  It’d come out anyway.\n\nIf they knew and covered it up, shame on them. But maybe, in some cases, they didn’t know.",
            "The laughter caught in his throat, a dry rasp. He'd tried to swallow it down, but the air itself felt thick with it. At first, he'd been okay, he supposed. But the day, that day, the world had tilted.  September's shadow had fallen long and heavy. And they went in, into that dust-filled land, under a guise, a pretense.  The Bush men, they'd tied it all together, the war, the towers, Bin Laden's shadow, Hussein's phantom weapons. A lie, all of it, a tapestry woven from smoke and fear.  It had chafed him, this deceit, this blood spilled in the name of a phantom enemy.  The Bush men, they'd lied to the people, plain and simple. Even Powell, the man who'd stood before the world and spun their tale, now admitted to doubt.  Malfeasance. An offense against the very heart of the nation.  \n\nHe saw it all, the slow erosion of the Constitution, the creeping darkness since the towers fell.  They'd come in, these men, with war in their eyes, a hunger for vengeance.  He recalled the name, a fleeting whisper, the treasury man who'd spoken truth, driven out like a dog.  The younger Bush, he'd carried the weight of his father's shadow, a thirst for retribution.  And oil. Always oil, the black blood whispering promises of power.\n\nIt had dragged on, this war, this wound festering in the land. A withdrawal, a sudden pullback, would only leave a bleeding corpse.  The UN, they'd spoken of a new order, a coalition, a patchwork of nations from the desert. But what guarantee was there?  Would Iraq's sovereignty be a hollow shell, a name whispered on the wind?\n\nHe saw the whispers, the news reports, the crumbling Parliament, the Prime Minister, a king without a kingdom.  Sadr, the man they'd fought, his name a ghost in the halls of power.  Factions, each clawing for control, each hungry for the spoils.  Friction, a slow burn, threatening to ignite the tinderbox. \n\nThe laughter came again, this time a choked sound, swallowed back down. Words, they failed him.  There were things, truths, he couldn't speak, not in this light.",

Didn't know the names of the battles, the faces of the lost.  Just knew the weight of it, the hollowness.  \n\nDemocracy, they said.  A seed planted in barren soil.  Oil, the black blood of the earth, a thirst that never quenched.  He saw the anger, the broken lives, the endless cycle of violence.  A land carved up, a people torn.  \n\nTo leave, to stay – both paths choked with thorns.  To fight, to build, to hold on.  The ghosts of Vietnam whispered in his ear, a warning.  A war without end, a stain on the nation's soul.  \n\nHe thought of the boys, the girls, the faces of the young, sent into the furnace.  And the families waiting, holding their breath, their hearts cracking.  He thought of the children, robbed of their laughter, their innocence.  A world drowned in blood, a future uncertain.  \n\nThe weight of it all, a burden too heavy to bear.  The war in Iraq, a tangled knot of shadows and lies.

You try to force it, to twist it to your will, you're spitting in the face of what's already carved in stone.  The ones pushing it down, they're picking and choosing.  Favor one flock over another. The Catholics, most of 'em stand against it.  The Christians too.  Except up in Boston, maybe a few outposts. But the government, they got no right to tell the churches what they can and can't preach.  Separation. That's the heart of it.  Tolerance.  \n\nTo amend the thing, that's just wrong. A contradiction. The only amendment I can think of that would chain the people, not the government.\n\nThis ain't the government's fight.  This ain't about the economy or the streets.

A tangled web they spun, linking it to that September day, the smoke rising. But the desert held a different truth. A truth born of sand and blood. \n\nI've never been one for war.  Especially not this kind. A strike in the dark, preemptive. A gambler's bet with lives. Like Vietnam, a mirror held up, reflecting the ghosts of a past we refused to learn from. How many sons and daughters laid low, their dreams turned to dust?  And for what? To carve out a new order, to impose a government on a land that had a government of its own?  \n\nThey said they'd bring democracy. Like seeds sown in fertile ground. But the land was arid, its people hardened.  They fought not an army, but a spirit, a resistance born of grief and fear.  We thought it would be quick. A swift victory, a clean sweep.  But the desert doesn't yield easily. It swallows promises and spits out despair.\n\nWe've been there years now, still trying to mold the land to our will. Still teaching them to police themselves, to be the government we want them to be.  A long and bloody lesson, etched in the sand.  \n\nMaybe we should have stayed away. Maybe we should have learned from the ghosts of Vietnam.  Maybe the truth wasn't hidden in the desert, but staring back at us from the mirror. A mirror reflecting our own hubris, our own thirst for dominion.",

It's a thing of the blood, not of the mind. To take that away, to deny them a name, a place at the table... that's a sin.

Now it's something else. A show of force. A hunger to prove dominion. Maybe the hunger was there all along. Bush the elder and his grudges with the desert fox. A serpent's coil tightening around a nation.  \n\nIf the aim had been to bring light to the darkness, to lift the weight of tyranny, that would have been a cause worthy of steel and blood. But if it was fueled by personal debts, by ghosts of battles past, then it was a sickness from the start.\n\nThe first strike, it spoke volumes. A thunderclap in the stillness. But the echo lingers. Years bleed into years. The desert sands turn red. And for what? We are the hammer, they say, but the anvil has moved too far.\n\nA country cannot be built on the bones of men, nor on the spilled blood of boys. A nation doesn't find its voice in the roar of guns. \n\nThere are things to be done here, at home. A rot in the bones of our own land. Poverty, hunger, the slow decay of dreams. These are the battles that demand our attention. \n\nThe money, the endless money, it's a river flowing into a bottomless pit. A pit built of sand and dust, of promises broken and lives extinguished. \n\nThe time has come to turn away. To close the book on this chapter. To let the desert reclaim its own. The sons of that land must learn to fend for themselves. They must find their own path. \n\nIt's time to walk away.",
            "The question hung there, a fly caught in the amber of the air.  Someone, it seemed, had gone searching, peering into the digital dark. Found something.  Stopped it.  Was it wrong?  This invasion, this looking.  \n\nOn these Myspace things, you put things out there.  Information.  Open.  Like a town square, everyone walks by.  Friend or stranger, it's all the same.  You've given them leave to see, to read.   \n\nBut what if you're looking for something else?  Not just any profile.  Looking for the signs, the whispers, the darkness brewing beneath the surface.  One man watching them all.  The good and the bad.  Seems wrong somehow.  A violation.  But what if it saves a life?\n\nIt's a hard thing.  A thin line.  Information out there, open to the taking.  Like a river flowing, you can't dam it up.  But you can try to watch the currents, to know where the danger might lie.\n\nI see it myself, the creeping shadows.  People looking in, knowing things they shouldn't.  My own picture, my words, my life, laid bare.  A man on TV, a ghoul.  He showed how easy it was.  Found a girl's name, her screen, her world.  Talked to her, tricked her, all in a whisper.  He knew her secrets before she even knew what was coming.\n\nIt's a strange feeling, this knowing.  That someone out there, a stranger, knows you better than you know yourself.  Your likes, your fears, your hopes.  It's a violation, a theft.\n\nBut it's also a part of this world now.  The internet, a vast and sprawling thing.  A place where secrets are whispered and shared, where the lines between public and private blur. \n\nThe school, they tried to stop it.  Myspace banned.  A line drawn in the sand.  But can you really stop the flow?  Can you hold back the tide?",
            "The desert wind scoured the edges of thought. This war. A stain on the sand. A bad idea from the start, they said. And they were right. The world knew it. Even those who wore the uniform, the ones sent to sift the sand for hope, knew it. A silent understanding in the eyes, a weariness in the heart. The polls, they spoke their truth.  Seventy-five percent, eighty percent. A chorus of dissent rising from the earth itself.  The Iraqi dust, the smoke of burning oil, the ghosts of a shattered land. It clung to the air, a constant reminder of the folly. Democracy, they said, a seed sown in barren ground. A fragile thing, crushed beneath the weight of history.  Saddam, a tyrant, yes. But what good is a fallen king if his kingdom crumbles to dust?  The desert waits, patient and unforgiving. It swallows the past, the present, the future. What good is staying? What hope is there in the wasteland?",
            "The world, it ain't changed much. Not for women, anyway.  The glass ceiling, they call it.  Still there, though it's supposed to be shattered. Men, they got trouble seeing a woman at the head of the table. Like it ain't natural. Ain't right.  But you see it in every damn field.  \n\nTake a woman with the know-how, the qualifications, she's ready to climb. But the men at the top, they don't take her serious. They see a woman, they think weakness. History, it's a heavy thing, drags us down.\n\nSame for the men.  Tried to raise a child, stay home with the little ones?  They get the stink eye.  Society expects the man to be the provider, the breadwinner.  But what about the man who wants to nurture?  To hold his child, teach him, raise him?  He gets judged.  \n\nAnd in those fancy places, the fashion world, the men who love it, they get looked at funny.  Don't belong there, they say.  Too feminine. Like a man can't know beauty, can't understand style.  \n\nIt's a twisted thing, this world we live in.  Change is slow, gradual like the setting sun. We're getting there, though.  More women in the boardrooms, more men at home with the kids.  It's a fight, but we're fighting.",
            "They didn’t make it legal, no. Decriminalized it.  Knocked it down from a crime to a ticket.  Something you get cited for, not booked, not hauled in.  Still, the shadow of the charge, it lingers. Job interviews, all those things.  The weight of it, even with the label changed. \n\nKids worry about that. The future, the mark it leaves.  But the state, they spend a fortune catching, holding, charging.  A court appearance here, maybe two, three.  Public defenders, judges, the whole apparatus.  And for what?  A lot of municipalities, strapped for coin, they can’t afford to let go of that revenue.  Even if it frees up funds for schools, for the elderly, for the hungry.\n\nDenver’s different.  People there, they lean a different way.  Liberal, they call it.  More open.  And so maybe there, it makes sense.  The money saved, it can go elsewhere.\n\nBut to legalize it, to sell it like cigarettes,  that’s a different matter.  Everywhere, smoke curling from cars, from mouths on every street corner.  It wouldn’t feel right.  There’s a stigma, a taboo, that wouldn’t disappear that easy.\n\nAlcohol, it’s worse for your hands, maybe.  But weed, it twists your life, your habits.  Both bad in their own ways.  But people, they react different.  Some go wild, some find balance.  It’s hard to say.",
            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. They say tradition is a root, that it holds you firm. But roots can strangle, too. They cling to the old ways, the dust on the altars, the pronouncements from long dead men. And they judge. They judge the straying sheep, the ones who don't fit the fold. My mother, she walked a different path. Episcopalian. They wouldn't let them in the church.  She loved God, but they wouldn't have her.  Love them, they preach. But this love is a cage, a gilded cage, for the chosen few. They speak of grace, but they offer only judgment.  \n\nThey say priests should be above it all,  above the weight of the flesh. But the flesh is a heavy thing.  It yearns. It betrays. And in the dark, behind closed doors, the sanctity of the cloth can’t hold back the shadows.  A man’s hunger, it knows no commandments.  They say marriage would be a distraction, but the heart seeks connection, even in the darkest of places. Is it the cloth that corrupts, or the man beneath? \n\nI don’t know.  I only know the stain of hypocrisy, the smell of incense masking the stench of rot.",
            "The matter hangs heavy. No easy answers there. Right and wrong, a blurred line in the dust. This thing, the church and the state, tangled up with the very definition of a bond. A line walked on eggshells, lest we offend some corner of the world.  \n\nCivil unions, maybe. A simple joining. Two souls. The government, should it concern itself with the particulars of such a thing?  Baptized souls, they walk unseen by the ledger of the state. The same should hold true for those bound in marriage. A sacrament, a joining of hearts, not a legal instrument to be weighed and measured.\n\nBut if the states can find common ground, a logic to the matter, then let it rise, a federal law.  But to amend the Constitution, to ban this love, this union, that is a folly. The Constitution, a heavy thing, not to be tampered with for matters of fleeting passions. Let them live their lives, these souls bound by love. Leave the Constitution to rest.",
            "Raised in the fold. Christian. The word hangs, a shadow, over these matters.  Sexuality, a tangled vine, twisting in the light. Friends, some of them drawn towards the dark, the unspoken.  I don't know that I could walk that path myself. But the law, that's a different thing.  A heavy hand, reaching too far, dictating the lives of men.  The whole country, bound by a single decree?  No.  Let the states decide.  Let the people of each land choose their own way.  Some states lean left, some right.  The tide turns, the wind shifts.  Let them grapple with these questions, these choices.  A man can't choose his own home, but he can choose to abide by its laws.  Give them the same chance.  Equal footing.  Same as the rest.  Let the states decide.  And let the president, that distant hand, stay out of it. His power, it doesn't reach to every corner.",
            "The boy spoke slow.  His words hung heavy in the air, like smoke from some long-dead fire. \"It's public,\" he said. \"Like a bulletin board. If you put something out there, you gotta figure folks'll see it.  School folks too.\"  He paused, fiddling with a loose thread on his shirt. \n\n\"They weren't using the school's name or nothin',\" he continued, \"but they coulda found it. From their own homes.  Maybe it's wrong, maybe it ain't.  But if it stops some kid from gettin' hurt, well, that's a good thing, ain't it?  That's what schools are for. Keepin' folks safe.\"\n\nHe chewed on his lip, eyes fixed on the floor. \"You know, it's easier to say what you mean when you're writin'.  But when you're talkin', words get tangled up, like weeds in a ditch.\" He looked up, his gaze direct. \"Like I said, it's public. If you don't want folks seein' what you're sayin', you keep it to yourself.\"\n\nHe recalled a teacher, a woman with tired eyes and a voice worn thin from years of talkin' to kids. \"She said, 'We gotta be safe,' she said. 'We gotta be ready for anything.'\" He remembered the drills, the cold metal of the fire escape, the way the world seemed to shrink down to the size of that classroom. \"We practiced, just in case.  Didn't want to be caught off guard.\"\n\nHe sighed, the weight of it all settling on his shoulders.  \"That's what they were doin', I reckon. Just tryin' to keep folks safe. From somethin' bad.\"",
            "The war. A fevered thing. Nine eleven. It burned in ya. Made ya want to answer back.  Like fire for fire.  Go over there and make them feel what we felt.  But maybe that was the sickness. All that heat. Didn't leave room for thinking.  No time for plans. Just fire. And it backfired.  It always does.\n\nThey fight amongst themselves.  Cannibal country.  Us going in there, it don't matter. They'll tear each other apart anyway. Doesn't change a thing.  I used to care, I guess. About what went on over there. Now it's just a weariness. A dull ache. Don't know if they're human anymore.  Just shadows with hatred in their eyes.\n\nWe went in blind. Didn't know what we faced. They fight different.  Savages.  Not building, not mending. Just tearing.  They want us gone. And maybe that's the only thing they're right about.  We shouldn't be there. Just hype.  Revenge.  Bush, he wanted it too. They wanted it. A voice in the dark saying \"go.\" And we went.  \n\nNo thought. No plan. Just the echo of the fire."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. It has its ways. Old ways. The men in robes talk of dwindling numbers. A harvest failing. I reckon it's these things they hold tight to, these rigid stances. Marriage, the taking of life, the control of the body. They speak of sin and damnation. But the world, it turns. Times change.\n\nFolks don't bend so easy anymore. There's a restlessness out there, a hunger for something more. They see the Church, and they see a shadow. A darkness clinging to the corners of faith.\n\nThey say the Church is against abortion, against the joining of two souls in love, against the choices a woman makes. And some, they hear these words and walk away. They seek a different kind of sanctuary, one that doesn't judge, that doesn't condemn. \n\nA woman, a priestess, perhaps. A man, bound by vows but not to God alone.  These are the whispers in the wind. Could it have changed things? Maybe. But the darkness, it finds a way.",
            "The matter of marriage.  A man and a woman. Two men. Two women.  Seems a simple enough thing, wouldn't you say? But the world, it twists and turns.  Some folks born a certain way. Some not. Doesn't make 'em any less...human.  To deny them the right, to call it wrong.  Seems a hard thing to stomach. Not my place to judge, not my choice to make. The government, they meddle in things they don't understand. This ain't a question of law, ain't no law against love, against the way folks feel.  It's about right and wrong.  And that's a question for the heart, not for some suit in Washington.",
            "The matter of marriage, of two souls bound, is a thing the law should not hold in thrall. Some speak of threats, of the family structure warped by love between men or women. But what threat is there in devotion? In a world where shadows lengthen, where kinship is not always blood, is a love less true for lacking the shape prescribed?\n\nThe coin has two sides, yes. But it is the metal that matters, the heart that beats beneath. The law should not be a judge of the heart. There are rights, rights that bind, rights that shelter in sickness and in health. A partner denied, a hand held back, is a wound the law should not inflict.\n\nAnd the studies whisper, a chorus of voices, that love finds its form in many ways. Happiness blooms in fields of every hue, in gardens cultivated by hands of different shapes.\n\nThe church, a house of faith, should not hold dominion over the state. Let the state provide shelter, let it not dictate the shape of love.\n\nSome cling to ancient fears, to scriptures turned to iron bars. They speak of morality, of a path predestined. But morality is a shifting thing, a compass guided by the heart.\n\nTo deny a love, a bond forged in the fires of devotion, is to deny a part of the human story. It is to build walls where bridges should stand.  \n\nIt is in the embracing of difference, in the recognition of a love that knows no bounds, that we find the truest measure of humanity.",
            "The pharmacy. Summer work. You see these pills, these poisons, stacked high behind glass.  Just because a thing is outlawed doesn't mean it holds no use.  No, sir.  There's a line.  For the open market, no.  But for healing?  Yes.  Medicinal, maybe.  Just because it's dirty doesn't mean it ain't got its uses.  \n\nThink of the ones they keep locked tight, the oxycotins, the vicodins, the percocets.  Controlled, they call 'em.  But we dispense 'em daily.  For good, for bad.  Same with this weed. This marijuana.  They call it devil's lettuce, but it might just hold the key.  \n\nAlcohol.  That's a different beast.  You can drown yourself in it, mind and body.  But this, this herb, it's different.  It ain't a demon, not like the hard stuff.  \n\nMaybe a slow hand on the throttle.  Legalize it, yes, but not in a rush.  Let 'em get used to it, let the shame fade.  Then maybe, just maybe, they'll use it right.  \n\nSee, the fear they have... it's all made up.

            "The church, it’s changed. Like the wind shifts, it’s taken on a new shape. Not as stiff as it once was. I remember Sundays when I was a girl. Dresses all buttoned and laced. Shoes to match, a purse to match. Every Sunday, the ritual. Same as all the other girls. Private school, the whole lot of us, dressed up like dolls for mass. But now, it’s different. They’ve got a mass for the young ones, quick and sharp, thirty minutes gone in the blink of an eye. People come in their beach clothes, sand still clinging to their toes. Families rushing in late, children crying. Jeans and khakis now at the morning masses, where I used to stand stiff as a board in my Sunday best. \n\nThe politics of it all, I don’t know much about that. But the change, I see it. That’s the church I know now.   \n\nThe talk, the accusations against the priests.  Evil things. I don’t know if any change could have stopped it. There are married men, good men, who do bad things. It’s a sickness, a darkness inside. Like a storm cloud gathering. It don't matter if they’re married or not.\n\nThey choose to be priests. It’s a path they walk. Some churches, they let the priests marry.  Like on that show, “Seventh Heaven.” The preacher, he had a wife, had children. But for those who choose the priesthood, maybe it’s not the right path. Maybe they should find a different way to serve.\n\nThis whole thing, it’s in their blood. It’s in their genes, I think.  Like a sickness passed down. Can’t hide it with a wedding ring.  It’d come out anyway.\n\nIf they knew and covered it up, shame on them. But maybe, in some cases, they didn’t know.",
            "The laughter caught in his throat, a dry rasp. He'd tried to swallow it down, but the air itself felt thick with it. At first, he'd been okay, he supposed. But the day, that day, the world had tilted.  September's shadow had fallen long and heavy. And they went in, into that dust-filled land, under a guise, a pretense.  The Bush men, they'd tied it all together, the war, the towers, Bin Laden's shadow, Hussein's phantom weapons. A lie, all of it, a tapestry woven from smoke and fear.  It had chafed him, this deceit, this blood spilled in the name of a phantom enemy.  The Bush men, they'd lied to the people, plain and simple. Even Powell, the man who'd stood before the world and spun their tale, now admitted to doubt.  Malfeasance. An offense against the very heart of the nation.  \n\nHe saw it all, the slow erosion of the Constitution, the creeping darkness since the towers fell.  They'd come in, these men, with war in their eyes, a hunger for vengeance.  He recalled the name, a fleeting whisper, the treasury man who'd spoken truth, driven out like a dog.  The younger Bush, he'd carried the weight of his father's shadow, a thirst for retribution.  And oil. Always oil, the black blood whispering promises of power.\n\nIt had dragged on, this war, this wound festering in the land. A withdrawal, a sudden pullback, would only leave a bleeding corpse.  The UN, they'd spoken of a new order, a coalition, a patchwork of nations from the desert. But what guarantee was there?  Would Iraq's sovereignty be a hollow shell, a name whispered on the wind?\n\nHe saw the whispers, the news reports, the crumbling Parliament, the Prime Minister, a king without a kingdom.  Sadr, the man they'd fought, his name a ghost in the halls of power.  Factions, each clawing for control, each hungry for the spoils.  Friction, a slow burn, threatening to ignite the tinderbox. \n\nThe laughter came again, this time a choked sound, swallowed back down. Words, they failed him.  There were things, truths, he couldn't speak, not in this light.",
            "The air hung thick, hot.  The questions, they came like cicadas, buzzing in his ear.  Iraq. The word tasted like dust and ashes in his mouth.  A pointless thing, he thought. A reckoning, a score to settle.  But for what?  Ghosts of towers falling, a shadow cast across the world.  Nine-eleven.  A wound that wouldn't heal, festering.  He wasn't a soldier, never had been.  Didn't know the names of the battles, the faces of the lost.  Just knew the weight of it, the hollowness.  \n\nDemocracy, they said.  A seed planted in barren soil.  Oil, the black blood of the earth, a thirst that never quenched.  He saw the anger, the broken lives, the endless cycle of violence.  A land carved up, a people torn.  \n\nTo leave, to stay – both paths choked with thorns.  To fight, to build, to hold on.  The ghosts of Vietnam whispered in his ear, a warning.  A war without end, a stain on the nation's soul.  \n\nHe thought of the boys, the girls, the faces of the young, sent into the furnace.  And the families waiting, holding their breath, their hearts cracking.  He thought of the children, robbed of their laughter, their innocence.  A world drowned in blood, a future uncertain.  \n\nThe weight of it all, a burden too heavy to bear.  The war in Iraq, a tangled knot of shadows and lies.  No easy answers, only the echo of gunfire, the whisper of the wind through the ruins.",
            "The law, it ain't right. No state should lay claim to it. This ain't their business. The Bible it speaks. Church and state. Divided. Plain as day. You try to force it, to twist it to your will, you're spitting in the face of what's already carved in stone.  The ones pushing it down, they're picking and choosing.  Favor one flock over another. The Catholics, most of 'em stand against it.  The Christians too.  Except up in Boston, maybe a few outposts. But the government, they got no right to tell the churches what they can and can't preach.  Separation. That's the heart of it.  Tolerance.  \n\nTo amend the thing, that's just wrong. A contradiction. The only amendment I can think of that would chain the people, not the government.\n\nThis ain't the government's fight.  This ain't about the economy or the streets. It's about faith, about personal convictions. The man pushing this, he's just trying to impose his own beliefs on the rest of us. One religion over all the others.\n\nIt belongs to the churches. It belongs to the people. Not the president, not the politicians.",
            "The war. A long shadow. Iraq.  Didn't the government tell us the truth? About why they went in, why they claimed the desert was a battlefield.  A tangled web they spun, linking it to that September day, the smoke rising. But the desert held a different truth. A truth born of sand and blood. \n\nI've never been one for war.  Especially not this kind. A strike in the dark, preemptive. A gambler's bet with lives. Like Vietnam, a mirror held up, reflecting the ghosts of a past we refused to learn from. How many sons and daughters laid low, their dreams turned to dust?  And for what? To carve out a new order, to impose a government on a land that had a government of its own?  \n\nThey said they'd bring democracy. Like seeds sown in fertile ground. But the land was arid, its people hardened.  They fought not an army, but a spirit, a resistance born of grief and fear.  We thought it would be quick. A swift victory, a clean sweep.  But the desert doesn't yield easily. It swallows promises and spits out despair.\n\nWe've been there years now, still trying to mold the land to our will. Still teaching them to police themselves, to be the government we want them to be.  A long and bloody lesson, etched in the sand.  \n\nMaybe we should have stayed away. Maybe we should have learned from the ghosts of Vietnam.  Maybe the truth wasn't hidden in the desert, but staring back at us from the mirror. A mirror reflecting our own hubris, our own thirst for dominion.",
            "The boy spoke slow, drawling out the words like a hawk scanning the plains. \"I'm for it,\" he said, \"always have been.\" He squinted, as if the sun was too bright, or maybe he was just thinking hard. \"A man loves a man, a woman a woman. It's a thing of the blood, not of the mind. To take that away, to deny them a name, a place at the table... that's a sin. It's inhuman.\" His voice dropped to a whisper. \"My own street, there's a couple, two men, never married. They walk their dogs, like any other folks. They love each other. It's no different. But they can't say it, can't claim it.\" He spit on the ground. \"That man in Washington, trying to play God, twisting the words of love... it's a mockery.\"\n\nHe paused, his eyes distant. \"They say now, it's in the brain,  chemistry. Some things you're born with, can't help it. Like the sky, the rain, the pull of the earth.\" He sighed. \"It ain't like a boy growing up with sisters, yearning for a brother. That ain't it.\" He shook his head. \"It's a simple thing, love. Two people wanting to stay together, to build a life. Should be their own business, not the government's.\" \n\nHe looked away, his voice a low rumble. \"A man and a woman, they can run off, get hitched in Vegas. Nobody cares. But two men, two women... that's news. A scandal. It's wrong.\" He spat again, the sound sharp and metallic. \"Love should be private, not a spectacle. It's not theirs to control.\"",

Someone's gotta hear it. Someone's gotta act.  They can't just let it float, can they? What if it takes root? What if it blossoms? \n\nBut the line's blurry, ain't it?  Sometimes it's just kids, messing around.  A sociology project gone wrong, maybe. A bad joke, meant to be funny, but landing heavy as a tombstone.  \n\nThen there are the times when it's not a joke.  A seed of darkness, planted in the fertile ground of the net.  A boy, a friend, something he posted. A dark joke, maybe. But in the right light, it looked like a threat. \n\nThe school found out.

Now it's something else. A show of force. A hunger to prove dominion. Maybe the hunger was there all along. Bush the elder and his grudges with the desert fox. A serpent's coil tightening around a nation.  \n\nIf the aim had been to bring light to the darkness, to lift the weight of tyranny, that would have been a cause worthy of steel and blood. But if it was fueled by personal debts, by ghosts of battles past, then it was a sickness from the start.\n\nThe first strike, it spoke volumes. A thunderclap in the stillness. But the echo lingers. Years bleed into years. The desert sands turn red. And for what?

A nation doesn't find its voice in the roar of guns. \n\nThere are things to be done here, at home. A rot in the bones of our own land. Poverty, hunger, the slow decay of dreams. These are the battles that demand our attention. \n\nThe money, the endless money, it's a river flowing into a bottomless pit. A pit built of sand and dust, of promises broken and lives extinguished. \n\nThe time has come to turn away. To close the book on this chapter. To let the desert reclaim its own.

            "The desert wind scoured the edges of thought. This war. A stain on the sand. A bad idea from the start, they said. And they were right. The world knew it. Even those who wore the uniform, the ones sent to sift the sand for hope, knew it. A silent understanding in the eyes, a weariness in the heart. The polls, they spoke their truth.  Seventy-five percent, eighty percent. A chorus of dissent rising from the earth itself.  The Iraqi dust, the smoke of burning oil, the ghosts of a shattered land. It clung to the air, a constant reminder of the folly. Democracy, they said, a seed sown in barren ground. A fragile thing, crushed beneath the weight of history.  Saddam, a tyrant, yes. But what good is a fallen king if his kingdom crumbles to dust?  The desert waits, patient and unforgiving. It swallows the past, the present, the future. What good is staying? What hope is there in the wasteland?",
            "The world, it ain't changed much. Not for women, anyway.  The glass ceiling, they call it.  Still there, though it's supposed to be shattered. Men, they got trouble seeing a woman at the head of the table. Like it ain't natural. Ain't right.  But you see it in every damn field.  \n\nTake a woman with the know-how, the qualifications, she's ready to climb. But the men at the top, they don't take her serious. They see a woman, they think weakness. History, it's a heavy thing, drags us down.\n\nSame for the men.  Tried to raise a child, stay home with the little ones?  They get the stink eye.  Society expects the man to be the provider, the breadwinner.  But what about the man who wants to nurture?  To hold his child, teach him, raise him?  He gets judged.  \n\nAnd in those fancy places, the fashion world, the men who love it, they get looked at funny.  Don't belong there, they say.  Too feminine. Like a man can't know beauty, can't understand style.  \n\nIt's a twisted thing, this world we live in.  Change is slow, gradual like the setting sun. We're getting there, though.  More women in the boardrooms, more men at home with the kids.  It's a fight, but we're fighting.",
            "They didn’t make it legal, no. Decriminalized it.  Knocked it down from a crime to a ticket.  Something you get cited for, not booked, not hauled in.  Still, the shadow of the charge, it lingers. Job interviews, all those things.  The weight of it, even with the label changed. \n\nKids worry about that. The future, the mark it leaves.  But the state, they spend a fortune catching, holding, charging.  A court appearance here, maybe two, three.  Public defenders, judges, the whole apparatus.  And for what?  A lot of municipalities, strapped for coin, they can’t afford to let go of that revenue.  Even if it frees up funds for schools, for the elderly, for the hungry.\n\nDenver’s different.  People there, they lean a different way.  Liberal, they call it.  More open.  And so maybe there, it makes sense.  The money saved, it can go elsewhere.\n\nBut to legalize it, to sell it like cigarettes,  that’s a different matter.  Everywhere, smoke curling from cars, from mouths on every street corner.  It wouldn’t feel right.  There’s a stigma, a taboo, that wouldn’t disappear that easy.\n\nAlcohol, it’s worse for your hands, maybe.  But weed, it twists your life, your habits.  Both bad in their own ways.  But people, they react different.  Some go wild, some find balance.  It’s hard to say.",
            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. They say tradition is a root, that it holds you firm. But roots can strangle, too. They cling to the old ways, the dust on the altars, the pronouncements from long dead men. And they judge. They judge the straying sheep, the ones who don't fit the fold. My mother, she walked a different path. Episcopalian. They wouldn't let them in the church.  She loved God, but they wouldn't have her.  Love them, they preach. But this love is a cage, a gilded cage, for the chosen few. They speak of grace, but they offer only judgment.  \n\nThey say priests should be above it all,  above the weight of the flesh. But the flesh is a heavy thing.  It yearns. It betrays. And in the dark, behind closed doors, the sanctity of the cloth can’t hold back the shadows.  A man’s hunger, it knows no commandments.  They say marriage would be a distraction, but the heart seeks connection, even in the darkest of places. Is it the cloth that corrupts, or the man beneath? \n\nI don’t know.  I only know the stain of hypocrisy, the smell of incense masking the stench of rot.",
            "The matter hangs heavy. No easy answers there. Right and wrong, a blurred line in the dust. This thing, the church and the state, tangled up with the very definition of a bond. A line walked on eggshells, lest we offend some corner of the world.  \n\nCivil unions, maybe. A simple joining. Two souls. The government, should it concern itself with the particulars of such a thing?  Baptized souls, they walk unseen by the ledger of the state. The same should hold true for those bound in marriage. A sacrament, a joining of hearts, not a legal instrument to be weighed and measured.\n\nBut if the states can find common ground, a logic to the matter, then let it rise, a federal law.  But to amend the Constitution, to ban this love, this union, that is a folly. The Constitution, a heavy thing, not to be tampered with for matters of fleeting passions. Let them live their lives, these souls bound by love. Leave the Constitution to rest.",
            "Raised in the fold. Christian. The word hangs, a shadow, over these matters.  Sexuality, a tangled vine, twisting in the light. Friends, some of them drawn towards the dark, the unspoken.  I don't know that I could walk that path myself. But the law, that's a different thing.  A heavy hand, reaching too far, dictating the lives of men.  The whole country, bound by a single decree?  No.  Let the states decide.  Let the people of each land choose their own way.  Some states lean left, some right.  The tide turns, the wind shifts.  Let them grapple with these questions, these choices.  A man can't choose his own home, but he can choose to abide by its laws.  Give them the same chance.  Equal footing.  Same as the rest.  Let the states decide.  And let the president, that distant hand, stay out of it. His power, it doesn't reach to every corner.",
            "The boy spoke slow.  His words hung heavy in the air, like smoke from some long-dead fire. \"It's public,\" he said. \"Like a bulletin board. If you put something out there, you gotta figure folks'll see it.  School folks too.\"  He paused, fiddling with a loose thread on his shirt. \n\n\"They weren't using the school's name or nothin',\" he continued, \"but they coulda found it. From their own homes.  Maybe it's wrong, maybe it ain't.  But if it stops some kid from gettin' hurt, well, that's a good thing, ain't it?  That's what schools are for. Keepin' folks safe.\"\n\nHe chewed on his lip, eyes fixed on the floor. \"You know, it's easier to say what you mean when you're writin'.  But when you're talkin', words get tangled up, like weeds in a ditch.\" He looked up, his gaze direct. \"Like I said, it's public. If you don't want folks seein' what you're sayin', you keep it to yourself.\"\n\nHe recalled a teacher, a woman with tired eyes and a voice worn thin from years of talkin' to kids. \"She said, 'We gotta be safe,' she said. 'We gotta be ready for anything.'\" He remembered the drills, the cold metal of the fire escape, the way the world seemed to shrink down to the size of that classroom. \"We practiced, just in case.  Didn't want to be caught off guard.\"\n\nHe sighed, the weight of it all settling on his shoulders.  \"That's what they were doin', I reckon. Just tryin' to keep folks safe. From somethin' bad.\"",
            "The war. A fevered thing. Nine eleven. It burned in ya. Made ya want to answer back.  Like fire for fire.  Go over there and make them feel what we felt.  But maybe that was the sickness. All that heat. Didn't leave room for thinking.  No time for plans. Just fire. And it backfired.  It always does.\n\nThey fight amongst themselves.  Cannibal country.  Us going in there, it don't matter. They'll tear each other apart anyway. Doesn't change a thing.  I used to care, I guess. About what went on over there. Now it's just a weariness. A dull ache. Don't know if they're human anymore.  Just shadows with hatred in their eyes.\n\nWe went in blind. Didn't know what we faced. They fight different.  Savages.  Not building, not mending. Just tearing.  They want us gone. And maybe that's the only thing they're right about.  We shouldn't be there. Just hype.  Revenge.  Bush, he wanted it too. They wanted it. A voice in the dark saying \"go.\" And we went.  \n\nNo thought. No plan. Just the echo of the fire."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community

every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. It has its ways. Old ways. The men in robes talk of dwindling numbers. A harvest failing. I reckon it's these things they hold tight to, these rigid stances. Marriage, the taking of life, the control of the body. They speak of sin and damnation. But the world, it turns. Times change.\n\nFolks don't bend so easy anymore. There's a restlessness out there, a hunger for something more. They see the Church, and they see a shadow. A darkness clinging to the corners of faith.\n\nThey say the Church is against abortion, against the joining of two souls in love, against the choices a woman makes. And some, they hear these words and walk away. They seek a different kind of sanctuary, one that doesn't judge, that doesn't condemn. \n\nA woman, a priestess, perhaps. A man, bound by vows but not to God alone.  These are the whispers in the wind. Could it have changed things? Maybe. But the darkness, it finds a way.",
            "The matter of marriage.  A man and a woman. Two men. Two women.  Seems a simple enough thing, wouldn't you say? But the world, it twists and turns.  Some folks born a certain way. Some not. Doesn't make 'em any less...human.  To deny them the right, to call it wrong.  Seems a hard thing to stomach. Not my place to judge, not my choice to make. The government, they meddle in things they don't understand. This ain't a question of law, ain't no law against love, against the way folks feel.  It's about right and wrong.  And that's a question for the heart, not for some suit in Washington.",
            "The matter of marriage, of two souls bound, is a thing the law should not hold in thrall. Some speak of threats, of the family structure warped by love between men or women. But what threat is there in devotion? In a world where shadows lengthen, where kinship is not always blood, is a love less true for lacking the shape prescribed?\n\nThe coin has two sides, yes. But it is the metal that matters, the heart that beats beneath. The law should not be a judge of the heart. There are rights, rights that bind, rights that shelter in sickness and in health. A partner denied, a hand held back, is a wound the law should not inflict.\n\nAnd the studies whisper, a chorus of voices, that love finds its form in many ways. Happiness blooms in fields of every hue, in gardens cultivated by hands of different shapes.\n\nThe church, a house of faith, should not hold dominion over the state. Let the state provide shelter, let it not dictate the shape of love.\n\nSome cling to ancient fears, to scriptures turned to iron bars. They speak of morality, of a path predestined. But morality is a shifting thing, a compass guided by the heart.\n\nTo deny a love, a bond forged in the fires of devotion, is to deny a part of the human story. It is to build walls where bridges should stand.  \n\nIt is in the embracing of difference, in the recognition of a love that knows no bounds, that we find the truest measure of humanity.",
            "The pharmacy. Summer work. You see these pills, these poisons, stacked high behind glass.  Just because a thing is outlawed doesn't mean it holds no use.  No, sir.  There's a line.  For the open market, no.  But for healing?  Yes.  Medicinal, maybe.  Just because it's dirty doesn't mean it ain't got its uses.  \n\nThink of the ones they keep locked tight, the oxycotins, the vicodins, the percocets.  Controlled, they call 'em.  But we dispense 'em daily.  For good, for bad.  Same with this weed. This marijuana.  They call it devil's lettuce, but it might just hold the key.  \n\nAlcohol.  That's a different beast.  You can drown yourself in it, mind and body.  But this, this herb, it's different.  It ain't a demon, not like the hard stuff.  \n\nMaybe a slow hand on the throttle.  Legalize it, yes, but not in a rush.  Let 'em get used to it, let the shame fade.  Then maybe, just maybe, they'll use it right.  \n\nSee, the fear they have... it's all made up.

            "The church, it’s changed. Like the wind shifts, it’s taken on a new shape. Not as stiff as it once was. I remember Sundays when I was a girl. Dresses all buttoned and laced. Shoes to match, a purse to match. Every Sunday, the ritual. Same as all the other girls. Private school, the whole lot of us, dressed up like dolls for mass. But now, it’s different. They’ve got a mass for the young ones, quick and sharp, thirty minutes gone in the blink of an eye. People come in their beach clothes, sand still clinging to their toes. Families rushing in late, children crying. Jeans and khakis now at the morning masses, where I used to stand stiff as a board in my Sunday best. \n\nThe politics of it all, I don’t know much about that. But the change, I see it. That’s the church I know now.   \n\nThe talk, the accusations against the priests.  Evil things. I don’t know if any change could have stopped it. There are married men, good men, who do bad things. It’s a sickness, a darkness inside. Like a storm cloud gathering. It don't matter if they’re married or not.\n\nThey choose to be priests. It’s a path they walk. Some churches, they let the priests marry.  Like on that show, “Seventh Heaven.” The preacher, he had a wife, had children. But for those who choose the priesthood, maybe it’s not the right path. Maybe they should find a different way to serve.\n\nThis whole thing, it’s in their blood. It’s in their genes, I think.  Like a sickness passed down. Can’t hide it with a wedding ring.  It’d come out anyway.\n\nIf they knew and covered it up, shame on them. But maybe, in some cases, they didn’t know.",
            "The laughter caught in his throat, a dry rasp. He'd tried to swallow it down, but the air itself felt thick with it. At first, he'd been okay, he supposed. But the day, that day, the world had tilted.  September's shadow had fallen long and heavy. And they went in, into that dust-filled land, under a guise, a pretense.  The Bush men, they'd tied it all together, the war, the towers, Bin Laden's shadow, Hussein's phantom weapons. A lie, all of it, a tapestry woven from smoke and fear.  It had chafed him, this deceit, this blood spilled in the name of a phantom enemy.  The Bush men, they'd lied to the people, plain and simple. Even Powell, the man who'd stood before the world and spun their tale, now admitted to doubt.  Malfeasance. An offense against the very heart of the nation.  \n\nHe saw it all, the slow erosion of the Constitution, the creeping darkness since the towers fell.  They'd come in, these men, with war in their eyes, a hunger for vengeance.  He recalled the name, a fleeting whisper, the treasury man who'd spoken truth, driven out like a dog.  The younger Bush, he'd carried the weight of his father's shadow, a thirst for retribution.  And oil. Always oil, the black blood whispering promises of power.\n\nIt had dragged on, this war, this wound festering in the land. A withdrawal, a sudden pullback, would only leave a bleeding corpse.  The UN, they'd spoken of a new order, a coalition, a patchwork of nations from the desert. But what guarantee was there?  Would Iraq's sovereignty be a hollow shell, a name whispered on the wind?\n\nHe saw the whispers, the news reports, the crumbling Parliament, the Prime Minister, a king without a kingdom.  Sadr, the man they'd fought, his name a ghost in the halls of power.  Factions, each clawing for control, each hungry for the spoils.  Friction, a slow burn, threatening to ignite the tinderbox. \n\nThe laughter came again, this time a choked sound, swallowed back down. Words, they failed him.  There were things, truths, he couldn't speak, not in this light.",
            "The air hung thick, hot.  The questions, they came like cicadas, buzzing in his ear.  Iraq. The word tasted like dust and ashes in his mouth.  A pointless thing, he thought. A reckoning, a score to settle.  But for what?  Ghosts of towers falling, a shadow cast across the world.  Nine-eleven.  A wound that wouldn't heal, festering.  He wasn't a soldier, never had been.  Didn't know the names of the battles, the faces of the lost.  Just knew the weight of it, the hollowness.  \n\nDemocracy, they said.  A seed planted in barren soil.  Oil, the black blood of the earth, a thirst that never quenched.  He saw the anger, the broken lives, the endless cycle of violence.  A land carved up, a people torn.  \n\nTo leave, to stay – both paths choked with thorns.  To fight, to build, to hold on.  The ghosts of Vietnam whispered in his ear, a warning.  A war without end, a stain on the nation's soul.  \n\nHe thought of the boys, the girls, the faces of the young, sent into the furnace.  And the families waiting, holding their breath, their hearts cracking.  He thought of the children, robbed of their laughter, their innocence.  A world drowned in blood, a future uncertain.  \n\nThe weight of it all, a burden too heavy to bear.  The war in Iraq, a tangled knot of shadows and lies.  No easy answers, only the echo of gunfire, the whisper of the wind through the ruins.",
            "The law, it ain't right. No state should lay claim to it. This ain't their business. The Bible it speaks. Church and state. Divided. Plain as day. You try to force it, to twist it to your will, you're spitting in the face of what's already carved in stone.  The ones pushing it down, they're picking and choosing.  Favor one flock over another. The Catholics, most of 'em stand against it.  The Christians too.  Except up in Boston, maybe a few outposts. But the government, they got no right to tell the churches what they can and can't preach.  Separation. That's the heart of it.  Tolerance.  \n\nTo amend the thing, that's just wrong. A contradiction. The only amendment I can think of that would chain the people, not the government.\n\nThis ain't the government's fight.  This ain't about the economy or the streets. It's about faith, about personal convictions. The man pushing this, he's just trying to impose his own beliefs on the rest of us. One religion over all the others.\n\nIt belongs to the churches. It belongs to the people. Not the president, not the politicians.",
            "The war. A long shadow. Iraq.  Didn't the government tell us the truth? About why they went in, why they claimed the desert was a battlefield.  A tangled web they spun, linking it to that September day, the smoke rising. But the desert held a different truth. A truth born of sand and blood. \n\nI've never been one for war.  Especially not this kind. A strike in the dark, preemptive. A gambler's bet with lives. Like Vietnam, a mirror held up, reflecting the ghosts of a past we refused to learn from. How many sons and daughters laid low, their dreams turned to dust?  And for what? To carve out a new order, to impose a government on a land that had a government of its own?  \n\nThey said they'd bring democracy. Like seeds sown in fertile ground. But the land was arid, its people hardened.  They fought not an army, but a spirit, a resistance born of grief and fear.  We thought it would be quick. A swift victory, a clean sweep.  But the desert doesn't yield easily. It swallows promises and spits out despair.\n\nWe've been there years now, still trying to mold the land to our will. Still teaching them to police themselves, to be the government we want them to be.  A long and bloody lesson, etched in the sand.  \n\nMaybe we should have stayed away. Maybe we should have learned from the ghosts of Vietnam.  Maybe the truth wasn't hidden in the desert, but staring back at us from the mirror. A mirror reflecting our own hubris, our own thirst for dominion.",
            "The boy spoke slow, drawling out the words like a hawk scanning the plains. \"I'm for it,\" he said, \"always have been.\" He squinted, as if the sun was too bright, or maybe he was just thinking hard. \"A man loves a man, a woman a woman. It's a thing of the blood, not of the mind. To take that away, to deny them a name, a place at the table... that's a sin. It's inhuman.\" His voice dropped to a whisper. \"My own street, there's a couple, two men, never married. They walk their dogs, like any other folks. They love each other. It's no different. But they can't say it, can't claim it.\" He spit on the ground. \"That man in Washington, trying to play God, twisting the words of love... it's a mockery.\"\n\nHe paused, his eyes distant. \"They say now, it's in the brain,  chemistry. Some things you're born with, can't help it. Like the sky, the rain, the pull of the earth.\" He sighed. \"It ain't like a boy growing up with sisters, yearning for a brother. That ain't it.\" He shook his head. \"It's a simple thing, love. Two people wanting to stay together, to build a life. Should be their own business, not the government's.\" \n\nHe looked away, his voice a low rumble. \"A man and a woman, they can run off, get hitched in Vegas. Nobody cares. But two men, two women... that's news. A scandal. It's wrong.\" He spat again, the sound sharp and metallic. \"Love should be private, not a spectacle. It's not theirs to control.\"",

Someone's gotta hear it. Someone's gotta act.  They can't just let it float, can they? What if it takes root? What if it blossoms? \n\nBut the line's blurry, ain't it?  Sometimes it's just kids, messing around.  A sociology project gone wrong, maybe. A bad joke, meant to be funny, but landing heavy as a tombstone.  \n\nThen there are the times when it's not a joke.  A seed of darkness, planted in the fertile ground of the net.  A boy, a friend, something he posted. A dark joke, maybe. But in the right light, it looked like a threat. \n\nThe school found out.

Now it's something else. A show of force. A hunger to prove dominion. Maybe the hunger was there all along. Bush the elder and his grudges with the desert fox. A serpent's coil tightening around a nation.  \n\nIf the aim had been to bring light to the darkness, to lift the weight of tyranny, that would have been a cause worthy of steel and blood. But if it was fueled by personal debts, by ghosts of battles past, then it was a sickness from the start.\n\nThe first strike, it spoke volumes. A thunderclap in the stillness. But the echo lingers. Years bleed into years. The desert sands turn red. And for what?

A nation doesn't find its voice in the roar of guns. \n\nThere are things to be done here, at home. A rot in the bones of our own land. Poverty, hunger, the slow decay of dreams. These are the battles that demand our attention. \n\nThe money, the endless money, it's a river flowing into a bottomless pit. A pit built of sand and dust, of promises broken and lives extinguished. \n\nThe time has come to turn away. To close the book on this chapter. To let the desert reclaim its own.

            "The desert wind scoured the edges of thought. This war. A stain on the sand. A bad idea from the start, they said. And they were right. The world knew it. Even those who wore the uniform, the ones sent to sift the sand for hope, knew it. A silent understanding in the eyes, a weariness in the heart. The polls, they spoke their truth.  Seventy-five percent, eighty percent. A chorus of dissent rising from the earth itself.  The Iraqi dust, the smoke of burning oil, the ghosts of a shattered land. It clung to the air, a constant reminder of the folly. Democracy, they said, a seed sown in barren ground. A fragile thing, crushed beneath the weight of history.  Saddam, a tyrant, yes. But what good is a fallen king if his kingdom crumbles to dust?  The desert waits, patient and unforgiving. It swallows the past, the present, the future. What good is staying? What hope is there in the wasteland?",
            "The world, it ain't changed much. Not for women, anyway.  The glass ceiling, they call it.  Still there, though it's supposed to be shattered. Men, they got trouble seeing a woman at the head of the table. Like it ain't natural. Ain't right.  But you see it in every damn field.  \n\nTake a woman with the know-how, the qualifications, she's ready to climb. But the men at the top, they don't take her serious. They see a woman, they think weakness. History, it's a heavy thing, drags us down.\n\nSame for the men.  Tried to raise a child, stay home with the little ones?  They get the stink eye.  Society expects the man to be the provider, the breadwinner.  But what about the man who wants to nurture?  To hold his child, teach him, raise him?  He gets judged.  \n\nAnd in those fancy places, the fashion world, the men who love it, they get looked at funny.  Don't belong there, they say.  Too feminine. Like a man can't know beauty, can't understand style.  \n\nIt's a twisted thing, this world we live in.  Change is slow, gradual like the setting sun. We're getting there, though.  More women in the boardrooms, more men at home with the kids.  It's a fight, but we're fighting.",
            "They didn’t make it legal, no. Decriminalized it.  Knocked it down from a crime to a ticket.  Something you get cited for, not booked, not hauled in.  Still, the shadow of the charge, it lingers. Job interviews, all those things.  The weight of it, even with the label changed. \n\nKids worry about that. The future, the mark it leaves.  But the state, they spend a fortune catching, holding, charging.  A court appearance here, maybe two, three.  Public defenders, judges, the whole apparatus.  And for what?  A lot of municipalities, strapped for coin, they can’t afford to let go of that revenue.  Even if it frees up funds for schools, for the elderly, for the hungry.\n\nDenver’s different.  People there, they lean a different way.  Liberal, they call it.  More open.  And so maybe there, it makes sense.  The money saved, it can go elsewhere.\n\nBut to legalize it, to sell it like cigarettes,  that’s a different matter.  Everywhere, smoke curling from cars, from mouths on every street corner.  It wouldn’t feel right.  There’s a stigma, a taboo, that wouldn’t disappear that easy.\n\nAlcohol, it’s worse for your hands, maybe.  But weed, it twists your life, your habits.  Both bad in their own ways.  But people, they react different.  Some go wild, some find balance.  It’s hard to say.",
            "The Church. A house of stone and shadow. They say tradition is a root, that it holds you firm. But roots can strangle, too. They cling to the old ways, the dust on the altars, the pronouncements from long dead men. And they judge. They judge the straying sheep, the ones who don't fit the fold. My mother, she walked a different path. Episcopalian. They wouldn't let them in the church.  She loved God, but they wouldn't have her.  Love them, they preach. But this love is a cage, a gilded cage, for the chosen few. They speak of grace, but they offer only judgment.  \n\nThey say priests should be above it all,  above the weight of the flesh. But the flesh is a heavy thing.  It yearns. It betrays. And in the dark, behind closed doors, the sanctity of the cloth can’t hold back the shadows.  A man’s hunger, it knows no commandments.  They say marriage would be a distraction, but the heart seeks connection, even in the darkest of places. Is it the cloth that corrupts, or the man beneath? \n\nI don’t know.  I only know the stain of hypocrisy, the smell of incense masking the stench of rot.",
            "The matter hangs heavy. No easy answers there. Right and wrong, a blurred line in the dust. This thing, the church and the state, tangled up with the very definition of a bond. A line walked on eggshells, lest we offend some corner of the world.  \n\nCivil unions, maybe. A simple joining. Two souls. The government, should it concern itself with the particulars of such a thing?  Baptized souls, they walk unseen by the ledger of the state. The same should hold true for those bound in marriage. A sacrament, a joining of hearts, not a legal instrument to be weighed and measured.\n\nBut if the states can find common ground, a logic to the matter, then let it rise, a federal law.  But to amend the Constitution, to ban this love, this union, that is a folly. The Constitution, a heavy thing, not to be tampered with for matters of fleeting passions. Let them live their lives, these souls bound by love. Leave the Constitution to rest.",
            "Raised in the fold. Christian. The word hangs, a shadow, over these matters.  Sexuality, a tangled vine, twisting in the light. Friends, some of them drawn towards the dark, the unspoken.  I don't know that I could walk that path myself. But the law, that's a different thing.  A heavy hand, reaching too far, dictating the lives of men.  The whole country, bound by a single decree?  No.  Let the states decide.  Let the people of each land choose their own way.  Some states lean left, some right.  The tide turns, the wind shifts.  Let them grapple with these questions, these choices.  A man can't choose his own home, but he can choose to abide by its laws.  Give them the same chance.  Equal footing.  Same as the rest.  Let the states decide.  And let the president, that distant hand, stay out of it. His power, it doesn't reach to every corner.",
            "The boy spoke slow.  His words hung heavy in the air, like smoke from some long-dead fire. \"It's public,\" he said. \"Like a bulletin board. If you put something out there, you gotta figure folks'll see it.  School folks too.\"  He paused, fiddling with a loose thread on his shirt. \n\n\"They weren't using the school's name or nothin',\" he continued, \"but they coulda found it. From their own homes.  Maybe it's wrong, maybe it ain't.  But if it stops some kid from gettin' hurt, well, that's a good thing, ain't it?  That's what schools are for. Keepin' folks safe.\"\n\nHe chewed on his lip, eyes fixed on the floor. \"You know, it's easier to say what you mean when you're writin'.  But when you're talkin', words get tangled up, like weeds in a ditch.\" He looked up, his gaze direct. \"Like I said, it's public. If you don't want folks seein' what you're sayin', you keep it to yourself.\"\n\nHe recalled a teacher, a woman with tired eyes and a voice worn thin from years of talkin' to kids. \"She said, 'We gotta be safe,' she said. 'We gotta be ready for anything.'\" He remembered the drills, the cold metal of the fire escape, the way the world seemed to shrink down to the size of that classroom. \"We practiced, just in case.  Didn't want to be caught off guard.\"\n\nHe sighed, the weight of it all settling on his shoulders.  \"That's what they were doin', I reckon. Just tryin' to keep folks safe. From somethin' bad.\"",
            "The war. A fevered thing. Nine eleven. It burned in ya. Made ya want to answer back.  Like fire for fire.  Go over there and make them feel what we felt.  But maybe that was the sickness. All that heat. Didn't leave room for thinking.  No time for plans. Just fire. And it backfired.  It always does.\n\nThey fight amongst themselves.  Cannibal country.  Us going in there, it don't matter. They'll tear each other apart anyway. Doesn't change a thing.  I used to care, I guess. About what went on over there. Now it's just a weariness. A dull ache. Don't know if they're human anymore.  Just shadows with hatred in their eyes.\n\nWe went in blind. Didn't know what we faced. They fight different.  Savages.  Not building, not mending. Just tearing.  They want us gone. And maybe that's the only thing they're right about.  We shouldn't be there. Just hype.  Revenge.  Bush, he wanted it too. They wanted it. A voice in the dark saying \"go.\" And we went.  \n\nNo thought. No plan. Just the echo of the fire."
